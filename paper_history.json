Yet dispersal costs vary with origin, sex, and life-history traits, shaping the balance between gene flow and adaptation. We quantified these heterogeneous costs by comparing the reproductive success of local and immigrant individuals using a 15-year genetic pedigree of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), including over 1,100 adults and 3,400 juveniles. Immigrants represented 19.5% of adults, showed male-biased dispersal, and averaged 15% lower reproductive success than locals. However, outcomes were strongly origin-dependent: immigrants from some populations suffered severe fitness costs while others matched or exceeded locals. Sex and life-history further modulated reproductive success: male immigrants underperformed local males, whereas multi-sea-winter females often equaled or outperformed female residents. Immigrant males partially compensated their fitness offset by acquiring more mates. These findings highlight that, while local adaptation promotes philopatry, immigrants origin effects should be considered in gene-flow adaptation dynamics.",

Though nucleosome-bound cfDNA harbors rich epigenomic features that could enable ctDNA identification by single-molecule multi-omics cross-validation, this remains unexplored due to methodological limits. Here, we developed a cfDNA sequencing approach integrating methylation, fragmentomics, and histone modifications at the single-molecule level; together with gene semantics and epigenomic annotations, these modalities were vectorized and fused to represent each cfDNA molecule. We trained a Transformer-based model (cfAI) to profile and evaluate ctDNA likelihood at molecule, gene, and sample levels. cfAI achieved ~10-fold enrichment of cancer-derived signals over noise and reached 72.6% sensitivity at 93.1% specificity for multi-cancer detection. Our study establishes an innovative framework that overcomes the inherent signal-to-noise limitations of conventional assays and reveals biological features at molecular resolution for cancer detection.",

This paper presents a combined theoretical and experimental study aimed at optimizing this procedure. First, a heat-transfer framework based on transient conduction and thermal diffusivity is developed to estimate stabilization times using dimensionless criteria. Then, extensive experimental tests on ATP containers validate these predictions and reveal additional phenomena such as air leakage and chimney effects. Based on these findings, a revised protocol is proposed that reduces the test duration from more than 18 h to approximately 2 h while preserving the thermal stabilization conditions required by ATP. Experimental results show that the uncertainty in the determination of the global heat-transfer coefficient K is reduced from about 2&amp;ndash;2.3% in the classical ATP procedure to roughly 0.7&amp;ndash;1.0% with the new protocol. In addition, the method suppresses secondary physical effects&amp;mdash;such as chimney-driven air leakage and latent-heat losses due to water evaporation&amp;mdash;thus improving the physical representativeness of the measured K value. The proposed accelerated protocol offers a scientifically grounded, cost-effective alternative for future ATP standards.</p>",

This is because of the technical constraints in capturing transient states or the nature of single-cell sequencing protocols. To address this challenge, we introduce a new computational framework, GRAIL (Generative Reconstruction of Artificial Intermediate Lineages), which aims to bridge these missing transitions. GRAIL reconstructs biologically plausible intermediate cell states between two distinct developmental stages (A and B) through a Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) based cell selection strategy followed by a smooth interpolation in learned latent space. The interpolated latent representations are subsequently decoded into gene expression profiles using a trained generator from a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The framework consists of three components: (a) a pretrained autoencoder that learns latent representations of stage specific transcriptomes, (b) an LSH-guided interpolation procedure that identifies anchor cells and performed interpolation in latent space, and (c) a GAN generator that extrapolates realistic intermediate expression from the interpolated samples consistent with the underlying trajectory. We benchmarked GRAIL with different state-of-the-arts (SOTA) in diverse setup of simulated dataets as well as in real life scRNA-seq datasets. Generated samples from GRAIL preserve expected marker gene expression patterns and also improve downstream analyses, including differential expression and cell clustering. Our method addresses the critical gap in studying cellular transitions when experimental intermediate samples are unavailable.",

Whereas I used to listen to music all the time, now I fill every available moment with the sound of people talking.</p><p>I suspect I\u2019m not the only one. My change in listening habits comes from a compulsion that many people in my life share: to make every minute of the day as \u201cproductive\u201d as possible.

Many of these are political, and they run the ideological spectrum. I reserve <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i>\u2019<i> </i>podcast <i>The</i> <i>Daily</i> for a short lunchtime treat. Then at the gym in the late afternoon, I\u2019m back to eavesdropping on other people\u2019s verbal marathons, many of them about exercise and nutrition.

Now I have to force myself to play anything other than chatter.</p><p>The pandemic was the turning point for me. I scarcely listened to podcasts before those days of tedium and seclusion, when overhearing a conversation almost felt like having company.

Hip-hop, the genre I grew up on, has entered a period of sustained decline. Everyone thinks the songs of their youth represent a golden era. But the rappers I listened to when I was younger really <i>were</i> better than today\u2019s artists, or at least more innovative\u2014maybe because the genre was younger, too. Dr. Dre concocted a sound that changed how the West Coast made music. Nas and Jay-Z could not only rap circles around the best of their successors; they could also smuggle some serious ideas into their hits. Consider this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJt7gNi3Nr4\">Socratic inquiry</a> from Jay-Z: \u201cIs Pius pious \u2019cause God loves pious?\u201d That type of lyric rarely comes around anymore.</p><p>In the late 2010s, so-called <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/2017/04/18/music/mumble-rap-moratorium-lil-yachty-desiigner-15bc3647dae9\">mumble rap</a> took off. Critics lamented that the genre\u2014and the styles it continues to spawn\u2014ignores lyricism and craft, a complaint that gives short shrift to the infectious exuberance these modes can produce.

Observers have proposed plenty of explanations.

    "abstract": "<p>For all of the political chaos that American science endured in 2025, aspects of this country\u2019s research enterprise made it through somewhat \u2026 okay<em>.</em> The Trump administration terminated billions of dollars in research grants; judges intervened to help reinstate thousands of those contracts. The administration threatened to cut funding to a number of universities; several have struck deals that preserved that money. After the White House proposed slashing the National Institutes of Health\u2019s $48 billion budget, Congress pledged to maintain it. And although some researchers have left the country, far more have remained. Despite these disruptions, many researchers will also remember 2025 as the year when personalized gene therapy helped <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2504747\">treat a six-month-old baby</a>, or when the Vera C. Rubin Observatory released its <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/news/first-imagery-nsf-doe-vera-c-rubin-observatory\">first glimpse</a> of the star-studded night sky.</p><p></p><p>Science did lose out this year, though, in ways that researchers are still struggling to tabulate. Some of those losses are straightforward: Since the beginning of 2025, \u201call, or nearly all, federal agencies that supported research in some way have decreased the size of their research footprint,\u201d Scott Delaney, an epidemiologist who has been tracking the federal funding cuts to science, told me. Less funding means <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/08/nih-funding-whiplash/683773/?utm_source=feed\">less science can be done</a> and fewer discoveries will be made. The deeper cut may be to the trust researchers had in the federal government as a stable partner in the pursuit of knowledge. This means the country\u2019s appetite for bold exploration, which <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/02/trump-science-data-gender-dei/681698/?utm_source=feed\">the compact between science and government</a> supported for decades, may be gone, too\u2014leaving in its place more timid, short-term thinking.</p><p></p><p>In an email, Andrew Nixon, the deputy assistant secretary for media relations at the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the NIH, disputed that assertion, writing, \u201cThe Biden administration politicized NIH funding through DEI-driven agendas; this administration is restoring rigor, merit, and public trust by prioritizing evidence-based research with real health impact while continuing to support early-career scientists.\u201d</p><p></p><p>Science has always required creativity\u2014people asking and pursuing questions in ways that have never been attempted before, in the hope that some of that work might produce something new. At its most dramatic, the results can be transformative: In the early 1900s, the Wright brothers drew inspiration from birds\u2019 flight mechanics to launch their first airplanes; more recently, scientists have found ways to genetically engineer a person\u2019s own immune cells to kill off cancer. Even in more routine discoveries, nothing quite matches the excitement of being the first to capture a piece of reality. I remember, as a graduate student, cloning my first bacterial mutant while trying to understand a gene important for growth. I knew that the microscopic creature I had built would never yield a drug or save a life. But in the brief moment in which I plucked a colony from an agar plate and swirled it into a warm, sugar-rich broth, I held a form of life that had never existed before\u2014and that I had made in pursuit of a question that, as far as I knew, no one else had asked.</p><p></p><p>Pursuing scientific creativity can be resource intensive, requiring large teams of researchers to spend millions of dollars across decades to investigate complex questions. Up until very recently, the federal government was eager to underwrite that process. Since the end of the Second World War, it has poured money into basic research, establishing a kind of social contract with scientists, of funds in exchange for innovation. Support from the government \u201callowed the free play of scientific genius,\u201d Nancy Tomes, a historian of medicine at Stony Brook University, told me.</p><p></p><p>The investment has paid dividends. One oft-cited statistic puts the success of scientific funding in economic terms: Every dollar invested in research and development in the United States is estimated to return at least $5. Another points to the fact that more than 99 percent of the drugs approved by the FDA from 2010 to 2019 were at least partly supported by NIH funds. These things are true\u2014but they also obscure the years or even decades of meandering and experimentation that scientists must take to reach those results. CRISPR gene-editing technology began as basic research into the structure of bacterial genomes; the discovery of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs depended on scientists in the late \u201970s and \u201980s tinkering with fish cells. The Trump administration has defunded research with more obvious near-term goals\u2014work on mRNA vaccines to combat the next flu pandemic, for instance\u2014but also science that expands knowledge that we don\u2019t yet have an application for (if one even exists). It has also proposed major cuts to NASA that could doom an already troubled mission to return <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nasas-mars-sample-return-mission-in-jeopardy-as-u-s-considers-abandoning/\">brand-new mineral samples</a> from the surface of Mars, which might have told us more about life in this universe, or nothing much at all.</p><p></p><p>Outside of the most obvious effects of <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/03/nih-grant-terminations/682039/?utm_source=feed\">grant terminations</a>\u2014salary cuts, forced layoffs, halted studies\u2014the Trump administration\u2019s attacks on science have limited the horizons that scientists in the U.S. are looking toward. The administration has made clear that it no longer intends to sponsor research into certain subjects, including transgender health and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/04/trump-hiv-public-health-revenge/682410/?utm_source=feed\">HIV</a>. Even researchers who haven\u2019t had grants terminated this year or who work on less politically volatile subjects are struggling to conceptualize their scientific futures, as canceled grant-review meetings and lists of banned words hamper the normal review process. The NIH is also switching up its funding model to one that will decrease the number of scientific projects and people it will bankroll. Many scientists are hesitant to hire more staff or start new projects that rely on expensive materials. Some have started to seek funds from pharmaceutical companies or foundations, which tend to offer smaller and shorter-term agreements, trained more closely on projects with potential profit.</p><p></p><p>All of this nudges scientists <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/2025/10/harvard-school-public-health/684576/?utm_source=feed\">into a defensive posture</a>. They\u2019re compressing the size of their studies or dropping the most ambitious aspects of their projects. Collaborations between research groups have broken down too, as some scientists who have been relatively insulated from the administration\u2019s cuts have terminated their partnerships with defunded scientists\u2014including at Harvard, where Delaney worked as a research scientist until September\u2014to protect their own interests. \u201cThe human thing to do is to look inward and to kind of take care of yourself first,\u201d Delaney told me. Instability and fear have made the research system, already sometimes prone to siloing, even more fragmented. The administration \u201ctook two of the best assets that the U.S. scientific enterprise has\u2014the capacity to think long, and the capacity to collaborate\u2014and we screwed them up at the same time,\u201d Delaney said. Several scientists told me that the current funding environment has prompted them to consider early retirement\u2014in many cases, shutting down the labs they have run for decades.</p><p><br /> \nSome of the experiments that scientists shelved this year could still be done at later dates. But the new instability of American science may also be driving away the people necessary to power that future work. Several universities have been forced to downsize Ph.D. programs; the Trump administration\u2019s anti-immigration policies have made many international researchers fearful of their status at universities. And as the administration continues to dismiss the importance of DEI programs, many young scientists from diverse backgrounds have told me they\u2019re questioning whether they will be welcomed into academia. Under the Trump administration, the scope of American science is simply smaller: \u201cWhen you shrink funding, you\u2019re going to increase conservatism,\u201d C. Brandon Ogbunu, a computational biologist at Yale University, told me. Competition and scarcity <em>can</em> breed innovation in science. But often, Ogbunu said, people forget that \u201ccomfort and security are key parts of innovation, too.\u201d</p>",

The rituals were usually framed as religious events supporting the broader group, and were tied to agricultural calendars. (\u201cPermit my harvests, my grain, my vineyards, and my plantations to flourish,\u201d some ancient Romans were <a href=\"https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cato/De_Agricultura/I*.html#note102\">counseled</a> to ask of Janus, the god of transitions and beginnings, \u201cand give good health and strength to me, my house, and my household.\u201d) Even in the more recent past, in the United States, many people\u2019s resolutions focused on learning how to live well with others. The most popular resolution in the U.S. in 1947 was, according to a Gallup <a href=\"https://www.almanac.com/history-of-new-years-resolutions\">poll</a>, to \u201cimprove my disposition, be more understanding, control my temper.\u201d Last year, by contrast, Americans\u2019 resolutions were <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/01/29/new-years-resolutions-who-makes-them-and-why/\">primarily</a> related to exercise, health, or diet.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2025/01/throw-more-parties-loneliness/681203/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Americans need to party more</a>]</i></p><p>Americans may no longer share a schedule dictated by the agricultural calendar, but a sense of community doesn\u2019t need to disappear. New Year\u2019s can be an opportunity to gather with loved ones and set resolutions together. Maybe everyone meets in person; maybe over Zoom. Maybe the group sets one big, collaborative goal\u2014<em>Let\u2019s start a community garden</em>, for instance, or <em>Let\u2019s take turns cooking meals for one another at home</em>. Maybe everyone picks a different resolution, and the group brainstorms how to best help each person achieve it. And ideally, the goals aren\u2019t self-serving\u2014but considerate of the people around them.</p><p>Making a resolution with other people might actually be more effective than flying solo. Habits are unconscious patterns that can be hard to shake, and seeing someone in our environment engaging in a certain behavior can nudge us to do it too, Tim Kurz, a psychology professor at the University of Western Australia, told me. This permeability can have its downsides\u2014your sister\u2019s <em>Is It Cake? </em>binge-watching in the living room could cue you to watch even more Netflix. But it can also be a great boon: As work piles up, for example, you might forget about your resolution to check in on older family members. If you have set this intention as a household, though, you might see your partner buying groceries for their grandmother, which in turn might remind you to call grandma too.</p><p>Shared resolutions can support intention setting in another way: They may help people avoid what social psychologists call \u201c<a href=\"https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/benoit-monin/topics/do-gooder-derogation-moral-social-comparison/\">do-gooder derogation</a>\u201d\u2014a quirk of psychology in which humans tend to \u201cfind people who are more moralistic than us and are behaving more virtuously than us really annoying,\u201d Kurz said. He gave me this example: Say you\u2019ve recently resolved to ride your bike to work instead of driving, for environmental reasons. Your family, already buckled into the SUV, might feel their virtue threatened and decide to poke fun at you. <em>Look at this guy! Have fun biking in the rain, Goody Two-shoes!</em> If you set goals as a family, however, your relatives\u2014who under other circumstances might be psychologically motivated to <em>subvert</em> your resolutions\u2014may become more committed to helping you follow through.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2025/01/habit-goal-psychology-resolution/681196/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Invisible habits are driving your life</a>]</i></p><p>In the long run, resolutions that keep others in mind tend to have greater staying power. Studies have found that brute willpower alone <a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2011/12/a-conversation-about-the-science-of-willpower.html\">lasts for only so long</a>, and that people have a much harder time accessing willpower when stressed. This might help explain why a more individual New Year\u2019s goal, such as losing 10 pounds by swearing off ice cream, may be more likely to fizzle. \u201cIf you fail in your quest, then the only person you have \u2018let down\u2019 is yourself,\u201d Kurz said. Evolutionarily speaking, people might not even be <em>built</em> to set self-serving goals. What helped our human ancestors succeed were likely \u201cstrong social bonds,\u201d the psychologist David Desteno <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/opinion/sunday/the-only-way-to-keep-your-resolutions.html\">wrote</a> in a <em>New York Times</em> article about resolutions, \u201crelationships that would encourage people to cooperate and lend support to one another.\u201d</p><p>Of course, shared resolutions aren\u2019t a magic pill for behavioral change. Humans can famously be both top-notch accountability partners and rampant enablers. When picking whom to make goals with, \u201cbe careful about who that person is,\u201d Kurz told me. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to strategically choose the person who you know is a total flake.\u201d You might have resolved with your work bestie to quit overdoing the happy-hour pi\u00f1a coladas so that you can better participate in your team\u2019s conversations; if your pal capsizes on your shared goal first, though, their decision could lead to a cycle of \u201ccollective rationalization,\u201d in which you feel okay quitting too, Kurz told me. <em>Hell, why not get another round?</em></p><p>Still, communal resolutions can serve as a good reminder of how profoundly interconnected humans are. And they can push people to widen their definition of self-improvement. In a recent interview, the Potawatomi botanist and writer Robin Wall Kimmerer <a href=\"https://atmos.earth/podcast/robin-wall-kimmerer-the-land-loves-you-back/\">described</a> the concept of \u201cexpanded self-interest\u201d\u2014the idea that the \u201cself\u201d can include all of life. \u201cMy well-being is the same as my family\u2019s well-being,\u201d she explained, and \u201cmy family\u2019s well-being is the same as the well-being of the land that feeds us.\u201d Bicep curls and matcha lattes, then, may get us only so far on the path to flourishing. The trick to helping ourselves might just be to focus on the communal first.</p>",

Here, we introduce a descriptor-guided screening strategy for designing cosolvent aqueous electrolytes that simultaneously optimize Al3+ solvation and suppress water reduction. Using this framework, N-formylacetamide (NFA) is identified as an optimal cosolvent owing to its high polarity that endows strong coordinating ability and its abundant polar sites that enable effective restructuring of the water hydrogen-bond network. Spectroscopic analyses (Raman, NMR, and FTIR), together with molecular dynamics and first-principles calculations, reveal that NFA preferentially enters the primary solvation shell of Al3+, weakening water coordination, while simultaneously restructuring the hydrogen-bond network to reinforce O-H bonds. The cooperative regulation of the local solvation structure and the aqueous environment substantially increases the dehydrogenation energy barrier, thereby mitigating HER and expanding the electrochemical stability window. As a result, NFA-based electrolytes exhibit enhanced anodic stability, lower HER onset potentials (from -0.7 V to -1.48 V), reduced interfacial polarization, and improved Al stripping/plating behavior relative to conventional aqueous and organic systems. Full-cell tests with MnO2 cathodes demonstrate superior cycling stability (retaining ~63% of capacity after 400 cycles) and higher voltage plateaus (by ~0.25 V), while safety assessments confirm the nonflammability and robust interfacial stability of the NFA electrolyte. This work establishes a generalizable molecular-design framework for tailoring solvent environments in next-generation aqueous metal-ion batteries.",

Lateral mobility, dimerization, clustering, and oligomerization are crucial behaviors in the activation process of RTKs on the cell surface. However, relationships between these molecular behaviors and molecular function remain to be elucidated, except for a few RTK members. Here, using an automated live-cell single-molecule imaging and analysis system, we studied the behavior of 52 of the 58 human RTK species on living cells over time during stimulation with ligands. We extracted 72 single-molecule parameters for each RTK species to examine their relationship to function, structure, and evolution. We noticed that RTKs' ability to inhibit or support cell growth, as observed in a large-scale loss-of-function experiment in the public domain, significantly relates to their behavior. Growth-inhibitory signaling was coupled with the immediate formation of immobile clusters, followed by the enlargement of immobile and slow-mobile domains. In contrast, growth-supportive signaling coupled with higher lateral diffusivity and delayed clustering of immobile molecules. The relationship between structure and function suggests that functional differences are related to partitioning into membrane rafts and changes in mobility associated with phosphatidylinositol turnover. In multiple linear regression models, molecular behavior explained half or more of the molecular function related to cell growth. This level of explainability is comparable to that of evolutionary grouping.",

The evolutionary origins of such complexes remain largely unknown. Using the genomes of 45 termites and two cockroaches, we investigated the evolution of sex determination systems in an entire insect lineage. We found that termite sex chromosomes are largely undifferentiated, likely reflecting extensive ongoing recombination. Evolving from the X0 system of cockroaches, most early-diverging termites exhibit a Y chromosome bearing the sex-determining gene doublesex, whereas doublesex is autosomal in most other termites. In contrast, other species exhibit multiple sex chromosomes that have undergone frequent turnover, except for Termitidae, which harbor conserved sex chromosomes. Our findings reveal important reworkings of the ancestral transformer-doublesex pathway in termites and suggest a potential role of doublesex in the formation of meiotic chromosomal complexes and caste differentiation.",

Arthropods, with multiple independent terrestrialization events, provide a powerful system to investigate whether parallel genomic changes underlie adaptation to land. Here, we present a phylum-wide comparative phylogenomic analysis of 309 arthropod species representing aquatic and terrestrial lineages, using gene family evolutionary dynamics and directional selection analyses to uncover shared genomic strategies associated with life on land. We identified thousands of orthogroups showing parallel expansions or contractions across the three main lineages that colonized land (Arachnida, Myriapoda, and Hexapoda), of which a significant proportion also exhibited lineage-specific shifts in selective pressure. Functional enrichment of these orthogroups revealed functional convergence on processes such as oxidative stress response, transmembrane transport, energy metabolism, exoskeleton formation, and moulting regulation. Notably, parallel evolution in aquaporins, solute carriers, cytochrome P450s, superoxide dismutases, and heat shock proteins suggests that a conserved terrestrialization toolkit underlies independent colonization events. Additionally, parallel remodeling of key developmental and immune signaling pathways highlights the role of regulatory and structural innovations in adapting to terrestrial challenges. Our results provide the first large-scale genomic evidence of parallel molecular evolution driving arthropod terrestrialization and emphasize the power of comparative genomics to reveal shared solutions to ecological transitions across deep evolutionary timescales.",

Here we report comprehensive characterization of two RlaP from Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PfRlaP and PaRlaP), respectively. Our study showed that, among macromolecules isolated from E. coli cells, only RNAs are the substrates of RlaP. In vitro assays employing synthetic RNAs as substrates demonstrated that RlaP catalyzes addition of one or two nucleotide monophosphate (NMP) to the 3'-hydroxyl group of RNAs, with the damaged RNAs as the preferred substrates. The crystal structure of PfRlaP provided insight into molecular recognition of RNA substrate and nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) by RlaP. Aminoacylation assays indicate that RlaP is required to restore biological function of the repaired tRNAs that have suffered excessive damage. Based on our studies, we propose an in vivo scenario where cell survival requires the involvement of RlaP in RNA repair to restore the biological function of the damaged RNAs.",

Non-insulin-based indices and refined anthropometric markers may offer simpler risk stratification in prediabetes and diabetes. Our objective was to compare insulin and non-insulin-based indices of insulin resistance, together with advanced anthropometric and lipid markers, between prediabetes (PreDM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and across hypertension grades in metabolic syndrome. We conducted a cross-sectional study in 200 adults with metabolic syndrome, 80 with PreDM and 120 with T2DM. Clinical, anthropometric and biochemical parameters were recorded, and HOMA-IR, Homeostasis Model Assessment of Beta-cell function (HOMA%B), Metabolic Score for Insulin Resistance (METS-IR), triglyceride to glucose index (TyG), triglyceride-to-glucose index to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TyG/HDL-c) and other derived indices were calculated. Group comparisons, correlations and multiple linear regression were performed. Compared with PreDM, T2DM showed higher glycemic indices and inflammation, but similar body mass index (BMI) and triglycerides. Across glycemic categories and hypertension grades, METS-IR, TyG and TyG/HDL-c increased and correlated strongly with body roundness index (BRI), abdominal volume index (AVI) and weight-adjusted waist index (WWI), while HOMA-IR contributed little independent information. In regression models, lipid adipose product (LAP) and WWI best explained METS-IR in prediabetes, whereas TyG and BRI were the main determinants of METS-IR in diabetes. In metabolic syndrome with PreDM or T2DM, METS-IR and TyG, particularly combined with BRI, AVI and WWI, outperformed traditional lipid ratios and added value beyond HOMA-IR. These composite indices appear useful for insulin resistance assessment when insulin measurement is unavailable or unreliable.</p><p>PMID:<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41465784/?utm_source=Inoreader&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=journals&amp;utm_content=101580444&amp;ff=20251230093723&amp;v=2.18.0.post22+67771e2\">41465784</a> | DOI:<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/life15121845\">10.3390/life15121845</a></p></div>",

For each system, we determine stellar masses, orbital parallaxes, effective temperatures, spectral types, semimajor axes, and eccentricities with high precision, resolving discrepancies between astrometric and spectroscopic measurements. Moreover, we assess the potential for stable planetary orbits in these systems. We also calculate habitable zones around these binaries based on the orbital evolution of planetary orbits. These systems may represent promising targets for future extrasolar planet searches around Sun-like stars due to their robust physical and orbital parameters that can be used to determine planetary habitability and stability.",

    "abstract": "arXiv:2512.11459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  \nAbstract: Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.",
