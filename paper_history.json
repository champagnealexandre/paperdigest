    "abstract": "arXiv:2512.22651v1 Announce Type: new  \nAbstract: The possibility that evolutionary forces -- together with a few fundamental factors such as thermodynamic constraints, specific computational features enabling information processing, and ecological processes -- might constrain the logic of living systems is tantalizing. However, it is often overlooked that any practical implementation of such a logic requires complementary circuitry that, in biological systems, happens through complex networks of genetic regulation, metabolic reactions, cellular signalling, communication, social and eusocial non-trivial organization. We review and discuss how circuitries are not merely passive structures, but active agents of change that, by means of hierarchical and modular organization, are able to enhance and catalyze the evolution of evolvability. Using statistical physics to analyze the role of non-trivial topologies in major evolutionary transitions, we show that biological innovations are related to deviation from trivial structures and (thermo)dynamic equilibria. \n  We argue that sparse heterogeneous networks such as hierarchical modular, which are ubiquitously observed in nature, are favored in terms of the trade-off between energetic costs for redundancy, error-correction and maintainance. We identify three main features -- namely, interconnectivity, plasticity and interdependency -- pointing towards a unifying framework for modeling the phenomenology, discussing them in terms of dynamical systems theory, non-equilibrium thermodynamics and evolutionary dynamics. Within this unified picture, we also show that slow evolutionary dynamics is an emergent phenomenon governed by the replicator-mutator equation as the direct consequence of a constrained variational nonequilibrium process. Overall, this work highlights how dynamical systems theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics provide powerful analytical techniques to study biological complexity.",

    "abstract": "<p><img alt=\"biorxiv_logo_homepage7-5-small.png\" src=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/sites/default/files/images/biorxiv_logo_homepage7-5-small.png\" /></p>Motivation: RNA molecules adopt dynamic ensembles of secondary structures, where the local structural context of each nucleotide--such as whether it resides in a stem or a specific type of loop--strongly shapes molecular interactions and regulatory function. Structural-context probabilities therefore provide a more functionally informative view of RNA folding than the minimum free energy structures or base-pairing probabilities. However, existing tools either require O(N3) time or employ span-restricted approximations that omit long-range base-pairs, limiting their applicability to large and biologically important RNAs. Results: We introduce LinearCapR, enabling linear-time, span-unrestricted computation of structural-context marginalized probabilities, using beam-pruned Stochastic Context Free Grammar-based computation. LinearCapR retains global ensemble features lost by span-limited methods and yields superior predictive power on bpRNA-1m(90) dataset, especially for multiloops and exterior regions, as well as long-distance stems. LinearCapR supports analysis of long RNAs, demonstrated on the full genome of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusions: LinearCapR provides the first base-pair-span-unrestricted, linear-time framework for RNA structural context analysis, retaining key thermodynamic ensemble features essential for functional interpretation. It enables large-scale studies of viral genomes, long non-coding RNAs, and downstream analyses such as RNA-binding protein site prediction. Availability: The source code of LinearCapR is available at https://github.com/hoget157/LinearCapR.",

    "summary": "The paper discusses climate bistability related to Snowball episodes, which is relevant to habitability and the development of complex life on exoplanets, but lacks direct focus on core origins of life concepts.",
    "abstract": "arXiv:2509.08994v2 Announce Type: replace  \nAbstract: Snowball episodes are associated with increases in atmospheric oxygen and the complexity of life on Earth, and they may be essential for the development of complex life on exoplanets. Sustained, stable Snowball episodes require a Snowball bifurcation and climate bistability between the globally ice-covered Snowball state and a state with at least some open ocean. We find that climate bistability disappears for an aquaplanet with a slab ocean in the global climate model ExoCAM when the orbital eccentricity is increased to 0.2-0.3. This happens because the Snowball state ceases to exist as seasonal insolation variations intensify, while the warm state remains stable due to the ocean's large heat capacity. We use a low-order ice-thermodynamic model to show that the Snowball state ceases to exist as seasonality increases because winter freezing at the ice bottom is reduced relative to summer melting at the ice top due to ice self-insulation. Combined with previous research showing that Snowball climate bistability diminishes for planets orbiting low-mass stars and ones with longer rotation periods, and that it disappears entirely for tidally locked planets, our work suggests that the Snowball climate bistability may not be as robust to planetary parameters as previously thought, representing one aspect of habitability more consistent with the rare Earth hypothesis than the Copernican principle.",

    "abstract": "arXiv:2512.21357v1 Announce Type: cross  \nAbstract: As of late 2025 there are about 70 exoplanets that meet the formal criterion of having equilibrium temperatures allowing the presence of liquid water and about 50 of them orbit M-stars, known for their strong chromospheric activity. Most of these stars are close to the Sun and the planet-to-star mass and luminosity ratios are advantageous, allowing for a more detailed follow-up than of planets orbiting hotter and more massive stars. Many more planets orbiting late-type stars are expected to be discovered by Gaia and PLATO in the following years. However, the lingering question remains whether the UV and X-ray emission, associated with the stellar activity, allows for complex life. A comprehensive study focused on properties of flaring exoplanet hosts and their activity, on a much larger scale than these few tens (soon to become hundreds) of stars with habitable planets is called for, to answer the question if such stars can harbor habitable planets. The proposed Wide Field Survey telescope is well suited for this study.",

    "abstract": "arXiv:2512.10060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross  \nAbstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant shift in astrochemistry with a renewed focus on the role of non-thermal processes on the molecular interstellar medium, in particular energetic particles (such as cosmic ray particles and fast electrons) and X-ray radiation. This has been brought about in large part due to new observations of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMS) in environments that would inhibit their formation, such as cold, dense gas in prestellar cores or in the highly energetic environments in galactic centers. In parallel, there has been a plethora of new laboratory investigations on the role of high-energy radiation and electrons on the chemistry of astrophysical ices, demonstrating the ability of this radiation to induce complex chemistry. In recent years, theoretical models have also begun to include newer cosmic-ray-driven processes in both the gas and ice phases. In this review, we unify aspects of the chemistry driven by X-ray radiation and energetic particles into a ``high-energy astrochemistry'', defining this term and reviewing the underlying chemical processes. We conclude by examining various laboratories where high-energy astrochemistry is at play and identify future issues to be tackled.",
