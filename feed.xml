While recent advances in cryo-EM have revealed domain-specific variations in ribosome structure, tunnel definition and comparative analyses have largely relied on pure geometric algorithms that often approximate the tunnel as a static, single tube with varying radius. Here, we present a functional, nascent-chain-centric characterisation of the exit tunnel across the tree of life, derived from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations using the most complete set of 55 distinct cytoplasmic ribosome structures. By mapping the steric accessibility through the "eyes" of the nascent chain (NC) at five different stages of translation, we reveal a topological and stage-dependent complexity invisible to static geometric approaches, demonstrating how tunnel accessibility dynamically changes during biosynthesis. We identify transiently accessible, bacteria-specific lateral branches ("side tunnels") that effectively expand the functional volume of the tunnel but may also serve as kinetic traps for the nascent chain. In contrast, we show that archaeal and eukaryotic ribosomes have structurally occluded these cavities by incorporating the protein eL39. These evolutionary "plugs" seal the tunnel wall and decrease its functional width. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the ribosome exit tunnel is not a simple linear tube, but a branched, lineage-specific landscape where accessibility is temporally gated by nascent chain length. This functional definition provides a new framework for understanding how ribosomal architecture modulates the early stages of protein biogenesis.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.64898/2025.12.25.696519v1?rss=1</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 13:20:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[85] Are we the Martians?

While scientists have theories, they don't yet fully understand the precise chemical steps that led to biology, or when the first primitive life forms appeared.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://phys.org/news/2025-12-martians-intriguing-idea-life-earth.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 17:02:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>[85] Designing Peptide Fossils That Model the Evolution of the Bacterial Ferredoxin Fold</title><link>https://astrobiology.com/2025/12/designing-peptide-fossils-that-model-the-evolution-of-the-bacterial-ferredoxin-fold.html</link><description>&lt;b&gt;AI Summary:&lt;/b&gt; The paper discusses the evolution of bacterial ferredoxins, which are crucial for understanding early protein functions and electron transfer mechanisms relevant to the origins of life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;Electron transfer coupled to redox chemistry is at the heart of metabolism. The proteins responsible for moving electrons (protein electron carriers) must have emerged at the origin of life. The small iron–sulfur-binding bacterial ferredoxins were likely among these first proteins. Embedded within the ferredoxin sequence and structure is a symmetry that points to an ancient […]&lt;/p&gt;
