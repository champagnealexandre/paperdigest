    "abstract": "<p><img alt=\"biorxiv_logo_homepage7-5-small.png\" src=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/sites/default/files/images/biorxiv_logo_homepage7-5-small.png\" /></p>Group II introns are self-splicing ribozymes that are considered the ancestors of the eukaryotic spliceosome. Unlike canonical group II introns that self-splice to generate linear exons and lariats, circularly permuted (CP) group II introns identified in various bacterial phyla perform back-splicing, resulting in the production of circular RNAs and branched products via branching pathway. Furthermore, CP introns may switch to a hydrolysis pathway resulting in distinct products to differentially regulate gene expression. In this study, we present biochemical data and high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of a CP group II intron from Comamonas testosteroni KF-1 (Cte 1), allowing mechanistic dissection of the branching pathway switch to the hydrolysis pathway and enabling reconstruction of both both steps of the hydrolysis pathway. The structures reveal that CP undergoes the hydrolysis pathway upon mutations of the branch point or splice sites (SS) due to rearrangements in the active site. Here, the branching nucleotide in domain D6 is retracted from its catalytically competent conformation, giving way to the nucleophilic water molecule to attack the 5' splice site. Furthermore, we visualized the intermediates of the second splicing step, which reveal the movement of domain D6 out of the way for the 3'-splicing to occur, closely resembling the second-step structures of the branching pathway. Finally, our structures provide direct evidence for domains D1D2D3 acting as a scaffold in group II introns.Together, these findings visualize the complete hydrolysis pathway and offer a new strategy to engineer CP introns for circular RNA production, with potential applications in both basic research and therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "Previously, we showed that the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein explores a wide range of biophysical properties facilitated by non-local impact of point mutations to its intrinsically disordered regions (Nguyen et al., 2024). This includes modulation of self-association, such as the creation of a de novo binding interface through the P13L mutation characteristic of Omicron variants. In the present work, we focus on the key function of N condensing viral RNA into ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) for viral assembly. Lacking high-resolution structural information, biochemical and biophysical approaches have revealed architectural principles of RNPs, which involve cooperative interactions of several protein-protein and protein-RNA interfaces, initiated through oligomerization of conserved transient helices in the central disordered linker of N. Here, we study the impact of defining N-protein mutations in variants of concern on RNP formation, using biophysical tools, a virus-like particle assay, and reverse genetics experiments. We find convergent evolution in repeated, independent introduction of amino acid substitutions strengthening existing binding interfaces, compensating for other substitutions that promote viral replication but decrease RNP stability. Furthermore, we show that the P13L mutation of Omicron variants enhances RNP assembly and increases viral fitness. Overall, our data reveal RNP complexes to be highly variable not only in sequence and conformations but also in thermodynamic and kinetic stability, with its pleomorphism affecting basic architectural principles. We hypothesize that the formation of polydisperse, fuzzy N-RNA clusters with multiple distributed weak binding interfaces optimizes reversible RNA condensation, while supporting host adaptation and allowing for a large sequence space to be explored.",

Yet dispersal costs vary with origin, sex, and life-history traits, shaping the balance between gene flow and adaptation. We quantified these heterogeneous costs by comparing the reproductive success of local and immigrant individuals using a 15-year genetic pedigree of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), including over 1,100 adults and 3,400 juveniles. Immigrants represented 19.5% of adults, showed male-biased dispersal, and averaged 15% lower reproductive success than locals. However, outcomes were strongly origin-dependent: immigrants from some populations suffered severe fitness costs while others matched or exceeded locals. Sex and life-history further modulated reproductive success: male immigrants underperformed local males, whereas multi-sea-winter females often equaled or outperformed female residents. Immigrant males partially compensated their fitness offset by acquiring more mates. These findings highlight that, while local adaptation promotes philopatry, immigrants origin effects should be considered in gene-flow adaptation dynamics.",

This paper presents a combined theoretical and experimental study aimed at optimizing this procedure. First, a heat-transfer framework based on transient conduction and thermal diffusivity is developed to estimate stabilization times using dimensionless criteria. Then, extensive experimental tests on ATP containers validate these predictions and reveal additional phenomena such as air leakage and chimney effects. Based on these findings, a revised protocol is proposed that reduces the test duration from more than 18 h to approximately 2 h while preserving the thermal stabilization conditions required by ATP. Experimental results show that the uncertainty in the determination of the global heat-transfer coefficient K is reduced from about 2&amp;ndash;2.3% in the classical ATP procedure to roughly 0.7&amp;ndash;1.0% with the new protocol. In addition, the method suppresses secondary physical effects&amp;mdash;such as chimney-driven air leakage and latent-heat losses due to water evaporation&amp;mdash;thus improving the physical representativeness of the measured K value. The proposed accelerated protocol offers a scientifically grounded, cost-effective alternative for future ATP standards.</p>",

Though nucleosome-bound cfDNA harbors rich epigenomic features that could enable ctDNA identification by single-molecule multi-omics cross-validation, this remains unexplored due to methodological limits. Here, we developed a cfDNA sequencing approach integrating methylation, fragmentomics, and histone modifications at the single-molecule level; together with gene semantics and epigenomic annotations, these modalities were vectorized and fused to represent each cfDNA molecule. We trained a Transformer-based model (cfAI) to profile and evaluate ctDNA likelihood at molecule, gene, and sample levels. cfAI achieved ~10-fold enrichment of cancer-derived signals over noise and reached 72.6% sensitivity at 93.1% specificity for multi-cancer detection. Our study establishes an innovative framework that overcomes the inherent signal-to-noise limitations of conventional assays and reveals biological features at molecular resolution for cancer detection.",

However, its occurrence dynamics and lineage specificity across the tree of life have not yet been fully characterized. Utilizing the recently developed and improved Z-DNA searching tool, ZSeeker, we analyzed 281,139 complete organismal genomes, including multiple Telomere-to-Telomere genome assemblies, and generated genome-wide Z-nucleic acid maps, examined their topography, and compared them to dinucleotide-preserving controls. Cellular genomes featured pervasive Z-DNA enrichment relative to expectation, with enrichments of ~1.5 and ~1.7-fold in Bacteria and Archaea and ~3-fold in Eukaryota. In contrast, Viruses exhibited large differences between lineages, with modest enrichment in several DNA viral groups and pronounced depletion across RNA clades, most notably Influenza A/B strains. We built a LASSO regression model trained on non-Influenza viruses (cross-validated R2 {approx} 0.73), which identified GC content, genome type, and host type as the leading predictors for Z-nucleic acid density, yet it significantly over-predicted Z-RNA density in Influenza A/B. More than 99% of assemblies exceeded the +2 SD threshold, and a \"typical Influenza\" genome was predicted at 2.76 bp/kb compared to ~0.016 bp/kb observed (a ~170-fold overestimation based on chance alone). Together, these results reveal domain- and lineage-specific regimes: cellular genomes are enriched for Z-DNA consistent with regulatory roles, whereas influenza viruses appear to have undergone strong, lineage-specific depletion of Z-RNA-forming sequences, likely reflecting evolutionary pressure tied to host sensing pathways.",
