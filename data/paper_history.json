I like to get there early. I always park in the same spot (right next to the cart return), and wait with the other die-hards. It has the thrill of a stakeout, absent any crime or danger. When the doors open, we move toward the entrance in an orderly march. There\u2019s a small gasp upon entry\u2014the kind of quiet awe that one feels before the most epic human achievements, as when stepping across the threshold of St. Peter\u2019s or the Chartres Cathedral. But in this place, there is no baroque majesty, no stained glass, just abundance bathed in light. In the sweep of human history generally marked by scarcity and want, here is bounty on an unimaginable scale; here is a year\u2019s supply of mozzarella sticks; here is a hot dog and a drink for $1.50; here is a monument of our civilization, in more than 600 locations across the United States.</p><p>I take the ease with which I resort to Costco talk\u2014about produce prices in particular\u2014as a worrying sign that I\u2019ve become a middle-aged bore. But there\u2019s something happening at Costco that I think goes beyond bell peppers (note that my family eats a lot of them, and, boy, are they a bargain). Costco is a marvel not just historically but also in this moment. In an age of broken institutions, insufferable politics, and billionaire businessmen auditioning to be Bond villains, most things feel like they\u2019re getting worse. Costco seems to stay the same. The <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/shephyken/2025/02/23/what-costco-knows-that-most-others-dont/\">employees are generally satisfied</a>. The customers are thrilled by the simple act of getting a good deal. All of it makes a unique space in contemporary American life, a space of cooperation, courtesy, and grown-ups mostly acting like grown-ups.</p><p>It starts with the thing you\u2019re pushing, the vessel into which you shall receive thy bounty. The cart is improbably large yet easily maneuvered through the warehouse\u2019s aisles. Through some invisible quality control, the sad and broken-down ones you find at the supermarket\u2014unlevel, rear wheel locked, front wheel spinning\u2014seem to be ushered quietly into oblivion at Costco. You\u2019re at the helm of a Peterbilt with the handling of a Porsche.</p><p>Traffic is never light, but things generally move along. Pushing something that large requires an awareness of oneself in space. Those who might need to consult a list or message their spouse\u2014<i>should I grab this brick of cheddar cheese?</i>\u2014seem to know to step off to the side. At my store in Granger, Indiana, where elbows are perhaps not as sharp as at some other locations, patrons appear to have an unspoken patience with the person who wants to give a bag of avocados an extra squeeze, or hold a double shell of raspberries up to the light. There are occasional expressions of camaraderie as well: \u201cWe can\u2019t get enough of that stuff,\u201d somebody might say as you load two pillow-size bags of Pirate\u2019s Booty into the cart.</p><p>You might see the bargain-hunting bonds among Costco shoppers as a function of the chain\u2019s history. To join its ranks costs $65 a year; the store\u2019s membership model originates from a nonprofit wholesale collective for federal employees called Fedco, founded in Los Angeles in the 1940s. The genealogy is complex (a three-hour-long <a href=\"https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/costco\"><i>Acquired</i> podcast episode</a> traces it in full), but one trait has endured: the company is animated\u2014even as a for-profit enterprise\u2014by the idea of bringing good value to its members. This has yielded a cultlike loyalty, such that the company can largely rely on happy members to do its advertising and marketing by word of mouth\u2014or perhaps by wearing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/costco-kirkland-signature-menswear/\">prized company merch</a>. Kirkland Signature, Costco\u2019s in-house label for hundreds of products, is a kind of anti-brand that happens to be one of the world\u2019s largest for consumer packaged goods. Just buying something under its comically dull logo makes you feel like a smart shopper: You\u2019ve made the wise decision to forgo a better look for a better price.</p><p>Costco is a place that encourages, and rewards, just knowing the drill\u2014and the drill isn\u2019t hard to figure out: Move along. Don\u2019t block the way. Unload your cart onto the conveyor belt with dispatch, but leave the heavy stuff. Make the barcodes visible. Violators are never exiled, but transgression, I know from experience, is not without shame. Once, I left the cart in front of the flower display loaded down with 120 pounds of water-softening salt. When I returned, the grandmother who was blocked from the flowers (find me a cheaper dozen roses!)\u2014well, she gave me the finger.</p><p>The veneer of civilization is always thin, even at Costco, as one is reminded before major holidays, or in the vicinity of the samples. When there\u2019s a Christmas feast to be provisioned, or half a bite of pizza to be tasted, order breaks down, and with it, spatial awareness, common courtesy, and <a href=\"https://www.gracegreeley.org/teaching/the-golden-rule/\">the Golden Rule</a>. We\u2019re circling like buzzards; we\u2019re blocking the way; we\u2019re shaking our heads at the nerve of the person who took the last three.</p><p>But the checkout restores us to our senses. At my Costco, there is usually a line to get in line for the cashier. People can game the system, but most quietly queue up, content to wait their turn to pick a register. The clerks are cheerier than they should be before this endless current of humans and their stuff. Whatever lapses I might have had in the store (did I take a second sample? maybe), here, I\u2019m on my best behavior.</p><p>Out of the store, car loaded, cart returned, I tighten up and steel myself for the road.

Roughly one in eight Americans <a href=\"https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/the-state-of-american-friendship-change-challenges-and-loss/\">reports</a> having no friends; the rest of us, according to my colleague Olga Khazan, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/09/loneliness-epidemic-friendship-shortage/679689/?utm_source=feed\">never <i>see</i> our friends</a>, stymied by the logistics of scheduling in a world that has become <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/03/opinion/holidays-social-media.html\">much more frenetic</a> and much less organized around religion and civic clubs. \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she writes, \u201cjust show up on a Sunday and find a few hundred of your friends in the same building.\u201d</p> \n \n<p>But what if you could, at least on a smaller scale? What if there were a way to smush all your friends together in one place\u2014maybe one with drinks and snacks and chairs? What if you could see your work friends and your childhood friends and the people you\u2019ve chatted amiably with at school drop-off all at once instead of scheduling several different dates? What if you could introduce your pals and set them loose to flirt with one another, no apps required? What if you could create your own Elks Lodge, even for just a night?</p> \n \n<p>I\u2019m being annoying, obviously\u2014there is a way!

    "abstract": "<div><p>in my undergrad i worked in a proffessors lab (voluntary), the lab was quite toxic, PI (A) treated undergrads as disposable labor and he was quite a predator/verbal harrasser but a genius so still had some respect within the department. Needless to say i hated the lab like many other students and quit after about 6 months. It was so discouraging I couldn't imagine myself working in a lab as a career at all. </p> <p>Another a year later, I joined another professor B. He respected work- life balance, was chill and respected his students. I ended up loving the research topic and worked in the lab for over 2 years ended up doing my masters dissertation there. I'm looking for work in similar areas. I build a good rapport with my supervisor and he showed interest in hiring me in the lab too (didn't work out later) </p> <p>I took a course co-taught by A and B, due to deaths in the family and being overworked because of my thesis I couldn't do well in that course and barely made it through. It was probably the worst performance I've had in my time at university I'm an otherwise good student. </p> <p>Recently i started applying and cold emailing labs Prof A somehow met a PI i had written to and gave a completely skewed opinion of me based on the course I performed badly in. He also ended up shit talking me at an informal setting and said he would discurage my supervisor to reccomend me saying it would ruin B's credibility to reccomend me further. A has no idea how sincerely i persued my dissertation, spent insane amount of lab hours (13 hrs/day several days). He's actively beefing with a student who's work ethic and goals he has no idea about. He's a well connected person and ruining my career aspects because of a course, when I only have one referee B who I have truly worked hard for and could recognise that. He's well connected and I'm scared how many opportunities I'm being denied because of this skewed opinion. This is my career and life. </p> <p>Is this how academia is?

I\u2019m David Frum, a staff writer at <em>The Atlantic</em>. My guest this week will be my <em>Atlantic</em> colleague, Charlie Warzel, the host of the <em>Galaxy Brain</em> podcast, and we\u2019ll be talking about our experiences as new podcast hosts. We both launched podcasts this year. Some of the temptations, some of the dangers, and some of the lessons that we have learned from this year in podcasting. My book this week will be a 1992 history book, <em>The Trial of Madame Caillaux</em>, a study of a sensational sex and murder trial in pre<em>\u2013</em>World War I France. But before getting to either of those things, I want to open with some end-of-year thoughts as we conclude 2025 and move into 2026. 2026, of course, is the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, in 1776, and is a powerful anniversary symbol in the American mind. As we move into this year, there are so many things that are going to be memorable and important and wonderful to celebrate. There are also some things happening that are really weird. One of the weirdest of them is a press release by the U.S. Mint just a few weeks ago. They are considering honoring the 250th anniversary of American independence with a set of commemorative, or dollar coins, featuring the image of President Donald Trump.</p><p>Now, it\u2019\u2019s not literally unprecedented for the United States to put living people on the coinage. It\u2019s not even totally unprecedented for them to put living politicians on the coinage. The first dollar bill had the face of Salman Chase, Secretary of the Treasury in Lincoln\u2019\u2019s Cabinet, on the dollar bill. Salman Chase was a famous egomaniac. One of his contemporary colleagues in the Republican Party said, <em>He\u2019s an excellent man</em>. I think that\u2019s the quote. <em>He\u2019s an excellent man, but he\u2019s got the delusion that the Christian Trinity has four persons in it instead of three</em>, the fourth being Salman Chase himself. So it\u2019\u2019s not unprecedented. There may be other examples as well, but it is strange and shocking at any time for a living person, and especially a living president, to propose to put himself on the coinage of the money of the United States. And if a Founding Father saw that, I think they would be kind of startled. They would be more startled, however, at some more serious things that are happening.</p><p>Some things that actually, unlike the dollar coin, which is just a project, have already happened in the year 2025. We have seen the president of the United States impose taxes at his sole volition. The Trump Treasury Department issued a release a few days ago that boasted that they had collected $200 billion in tariffs over the year 2025. That\u2019s $200 billion of taxes not authorized by Congress and a flagrant violation of the ideas and literal language of Article 1 of the Constitution, which puts both taxes and tariffs in the hands of Congress. The president and his team are proposing to spend that $200 billion. They\u2019ve had many ideas about how to spend it. Maybe they should give the money to the farmers. Maybe there should be a tax rebate. Maybe they should do something else. But all of those ideas for spending or tax rebates, again, all of those are congressional authority that the president is arrogating to himself\u2014something else that would have startled the founders of the country all those 250 years ago.</p><p>We\u2019ve seen the growth of an enormous federal police force, ICE, which has recruited and seems to take orders not from any kind of institution of law but from, again, a small team around the president, an almost personal police force of a kind that the United States has not seen before, certainly not on such a scale. And carrying out actions that, again, would have seemed unimaginable only a little while ago. Mass roundups without any kind of due process; mass deportations. Deportation, of course, is a total presidential authority, but usually there\u2019s some kind of hearing. And, of course, until now, you almost always\u2014the deported person is sent back to the place the deported person came from, not to a third country to which they had no contact, and not under conditions that are tantamount to torture or at least serious human-rights abuse. You would send them home. It\u2019s not a crime to be illegally present in the United States. It\u2019s a violation of the law, but it\u2019s not something that you should be tortured for. You should be put on a plane, given a hot meal, and warned, <em>Don\u2019t come back, you\u2019re breaking the rules</em>. We\u2019ve seen the rise of presidential retaliation against media institutions using the regulatory apparatus of the state, regulatory apparatus that belongs to everybody, not just to him. And then using those same grants of threats, grants of regulatory favors or threats of the withholding of regulatory favors, to rearrange or redirect existing media companies to be more favorable to him, sometimes successfully, sometimes less so, but always with a kind of intent that would have seemed very sinister from the point of view of the founders of the American Republic. And we have seen, maybe most disturbing of all, the use of presidential war powers without any involvement of any kind of legal authority, any kind of congressional authority. We\u2019re on the cusp, apparently, of some kind of military action against Venezuela\u2014maybe airstrikes, maybe clandestine strikes of commandos, maybe something more. There\u2019s no pretense that there\u2019s any congressional authorization of that. And over the Christmas holiday, the president fired missiles into Nigeria, intervening in Nigerian civil strife, again, with no pretense of any kind of authorization by anyone other than the president at his own whim. So the big question for the year 2026 is: How far has the country drifted from those ideals of 1776 as formalized in the Constitution of 1787 and all the amendments afterwards? And how does the United States move back to the country it intended to be at the beginning, that Americans believed it to be until very recently, and that I think most Americans still want it to be.</p><p>Now, here\u2019s some good news. It does seem like over the course of 2025, that these lawless actions have lost some of their impact and power. The bad guys seem to be losing a little political altitude as we move into 2026. I don\u2019t want to be overconfident about that. I don\u2019t want to issue false promises. But it does seem like the ebb and flow of political power is not favoring those who want to use arbitrary power in the way they\u2019ve used it. Some examples: There does seem to be, in this second Trump term, a real loss of focus, an inability to keep the main thing the main thing. The battle over renaming the Kennedy Center the Trump Kennedy Center: That seems like a perfect example of something that any serious authoritarian president would not waste energy over. What does he care? He\u2019s staffed it with his cronies. They\u2019re going to do the shows that he likes; he\u2019s gonna be able to blackball the people he doesn\u2019t like. Does he really need to put his name on it? Does he need to host the Kennedy Honors on prime-time television? Is that really something that he needs to invest energy in? And even the dollar coins, that just makes enemies. Why are you doing that? What is the petty, pathetic need that makes you trade the substance of political power for these childish shows? But that need is there and it\u2019s a political fact, and it\u2019s an expensive political fact\u2014and therefore for those who oppose the authoritarian project, a hopeful political fact.</p><p>But more substantially, two other things are happening that are really changing the political calculus as we move into the year 2026. One is the weakening of the American economy. One of the things that any successful authoritarian knows is you have to get the economy right. People will put up with a lot if they\u2019re feeling prosperous. As they enter 2026, fewer and fewer Americans are feeling prosperous. Prices are rising; job creation is stalling. The center of energy in the American economy is the artificial-intelligence-investment boom. That may continue, it may not, but through the rest of the economy, it\u2019s trouble. Everywhere there\u2019s signs of trouble: rising corporate bankruptcies, defaults on automobile loans. Americans are not feeling like Trump is thinking of them as he thinks of himself. Trump 1, the theory seemed to be that the public would forgive Trump\u2019s actions if he provided economic prosperity. Trump 2, the president is actually actively attacking prosperity through his taxes and tariffs, through his immigration policy, shrinking the American population, shrinking the American workforce. And it seems like that\u2019s his agenda. So what do you get for putting up with it? Nothing, just a kick in the head.</p><p>But the last thing, and Michael Waldman and I discussed this earlier this year in an important podcast discussion: Trump has lost much of his bet to centralize the management of elections in his own hands. Not all of the bet. He\u2019s still got tricks up his sleeve. There are many things he\u2019s trying to do. But through the genius of American federalism, which is part of the genius of 1776 and 1787, election management is left in the hands of the state, of the several states.</p><p>And while it\u2019s not impossible for a president to squeeze and coax and coerce and rig those elections, there are limits to his ability to do it. In the end, it is a state power governed by the actions of the states and administered by officials of the states. And there is a limit to how much the president can successfully intervene to corrupt or distort that process. Now, if the election is close, those interventions and distortions may be enough.</p><p>But when you have, through bad economic policy, you\u2019ve stoked so much discontent as this administration has, you may have moved the whole political temperature\u2014the whole political balance of political forces\u2014beyond the margin of successful manipulation. And that means that the corrective response, that the genius of the system always anticipated as the ultimate answer to abuses, that corrective response may be coming, and 2026 may be the year that we feel it.</p><p>And now, my dialogue with Charlie Warzel.</p><p><strong>[<em>Music</em>]</strong></p><p><strong>Frum:</strong> So <em>The Atlantic </em>is, today, presenting something a little different. I will interview today my colleague Charlie Warzel, who has launched his own new podcast on the <em>Atlantic</em> channel, <em>Galaxy Brain</em>. We\u2019ll be talking back and forth. Since the <em>Galaxy Brain</em> podcast is quite new, I\u2019m going to read a little introduction for those of you who don\u2019t know Charlie.</p><p>He joined <em>The Atlantic</em> in 2021 and became a staff writer in 2022. This year, he launched his new podcast, <em>Galaxy Brain</em>. Charlie is a graduate of Hamilton College and he\u2019s the author of the 2021 book <em>Out of Office: Unlocking the Power and Potential of Hybrid Work</em>. And we\u2019re gonna talk about some of the experiences, challenges, temptations of doing a podcast in this day and age, especially for <em>The Atlantic</em>.</p><p>And I\u2019m happy to welcome Charlie. Charlie, congratulations on the new podcast.</p><p><strong>Charlie Warzel:</strong> Thank you. Thank you for having me. This is great.</p><p><strong>Frum:</strong> All right, so we\u2019re both kind of newbies. I\u2019m like a grizzled veteran with like a three or four month head start ahead of you, so that makes me a frontline soldier.</p><p>But we\u2019re both familiar with being guests on podcasts, but new to hosting.</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> Yes. And it\u2019s very different. Right? It is a whole different, at least I\u2019ve found, it\u2019s a completely different animal being on the other side.</p><p><strong>Frum:</strong> If I\u2019d known how hard it was, I would\u2019ve been nicer to my hosts.</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> Exactly. Exactly. Yes. It\u2019s very difficult to construct a conversation and have a flow and end up in the right place and follow the tributaries of a guest\u2019s meandering mind. It\u2019s\u2014definitely, it\u2019s fascinating.</p><p><strong>Frum:</strong> Well, so here\u2019s this thing. In order to avoid meandering, here\u2019s how I propose to channel the conversation so that we achieve something that\u2019s I hope useful and interesting for our listeners and viewers, and maybe something we both ourselves will learn from. Because one of the things we\u2019ve had to confront as we enter this is: Unlike old-fashioned book writing, or text based or even print journalism, where you don\u2019t know exactly what your readers want and what they read, you know a lot about the podcast audience, both video and audio.</p><p>And we also have the contrasting examples of other people in the space who demonstrate what viewers and listeners want and don\u2019t want. And one of the things we\u2019ve had to confront is the tremendous appetite, or apparent appetite, for extreme content, which flies in the face of what <em>The Atlantic</em> is always trying to provide, which is balanced content.</p><p>How do we make sense of that? How do we respond to that? I mean, I think you get a lot of response to if you do a show on <em>Was Hitler good? Yes.</em> But we\u2019re not going to do the <em>Was Hitler good? Yes </em>show. But how do you cope with the massive incentives to do a show on <em>Was Hitler good? Yes.</em></p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> I see this as part of a bigger struggle, right? I write a lot about technology, about media, media ecology, the ways that social media has warped or changed or transformed society. It\u2019s a lot of what the podcast is about. And so there\u2019s always like a meta element to everything that I am both doing in my actual work and what I am reporting on.</p><p>And, they tend to feed each other, right? So I look at this as. I look at podcasting, especially video podcasting and the regular, traditional podcasting as, in many ways, almost the traditional problems with internet based or digital media on steroids, right? We are now, because of the issues of discovery, because of, you know, the advent of everything from generative AI to social networks, to declining readership because a lot of the social platforms have given up on news to some degree. We don\u2019t get that same bump from Google. We don\u2019t get that same bump from Facebook, et cetera. It has pushed everything to be so much more algorithmically driven. Right. We try to make the best journalistic products that we can, the most responsible ones, but at the end of the day, we are also people who are interested in having that have an impact in the world, to reach as many people as possible, and these algorithms are tailored more and more and more to be, to promote, the most sensational thing. The thing that outrages, the thing that shocks, the thing that elicits the greatest response, and the greatest response of all of those emotional reactions is outrage, is fear, is shock, is anger. Right? And so I look at what we\u2019re doing right now as having to chase this type of viewership.</p><p>We are in this attention economy. We are basically forced to, if we want people to interact with the thing that we have spent all this time laboring over. We have to find a way to frame it, right? I think a lot of this is like a marketplace. And every vendor is out there needing to, you know, get people and attract people.</p><p>And so you\u2019re constantly reaching there. And it\u2019s difficult, because it pushes people to be the worst versions of themselves. And we have to guard against that. We can\u2019t, you know, succumb to that, like, say, a random person on Twitter or X might.</p><p><strong>Frum:</strong> Yeah. Now you\u2019re blaming the algorithm a lot here, which is a non-sentient collection of digits. And that\u2019s convenient because it has no feelings. Maybe the user, the listener, the reader is a little bit to blame?</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> Well, so there\u2019s a very interesting issue that I have always seen, right? I hate to blame the reader, because the reader is also in some sense\u2014</p><p><strong>Frum:</strong> the customer, and no one ever got anywhere by disrespecting the customer, at least not in public. But let\u2019s pretend we\u2019re in private for a minute.</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> Absolutely. I think that this is a problem. People\u2019s actual preference and their stated preference is always very different, in all consumerism but especially with the news. You see a lot of people both online and in reader surveys of all kinds of different places where I\u2019ve worked, and they say that they want to read more about the vegetables, right, like eat-your-vegetables-type stuff. They want to read about climate change more. Anyone who has worked in digital media, in any case, and has access to the metrics, can see that stories about climate change, very broadly speaking, do not perform as well as stories about, say, Donald Trump or somebody who is constantly stoking outrage.</p><p>So there is this real reader preference: stated versus actual, right. People are clicking on the outrageous things, the thumbnails with people\u2019s eyes that are, you know, bulging out and stuff like that, and not spending time with that really nuanced headline that is actually, quote unquote, you know, boring, butinside is a very nutritional and dense and smart story.</p><p><strong>Frum:</strong> Well, this is not a new thing. This has been true as long as there is media. I mean, I remember a passage in Proust\u2019s great novel <em>Remembrance of Things Past </em>where a character says, who has a beautiful library full of hand-tooled volumes, which he never opens, and he thinks, <em>What if every morning they were delivered to my front door in sheet paper, a copy of Pascal\u2019s Pens\u00e9es</em>. <em>And in that leather-bound edition up there, which I open once every 10 years, there was a description of the dress worn by the duchess of so-and-so at the party last night.</em> So media is always sensational, but here\u2019s to my mind, the difference. In1975, there probably were as many people in the United States who wanted to read, or proportionally as many people, who wanted to read or consume Nazi-based content as there were today, or anti-Semitic content as there are today.</p><p>But either silently or even explicitly, the heads of CBS, ABC, NBC, <em>The</em> <em>New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Time, Newsweek,</em> that was the media, said, <em>You know what? They want Nazi content; they want anti-Semitic content. They\u2019re not going to get it. We\u2019re not going to give it to them.</em></p><p>And if we 10 people agree we\u2019re not going to give them Nazi content, then they have to get it from pretty obscure places. But there was always that market. There was money waiting. There was a hundred-dollar bill lying on the sidewalk and no one picked it up. And we have a more competitive marketplace, and somebody picks it up.</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> This is a little bit, though, why I blame the algorithms so fully, right? Because the algorithms are also very powerful in terms of broadcasting and boosting the people who are willing to do that thing, right? These people don\u2019t just come out of nowhere. You know, I think very broadly of the ecosystem that you and I are now a part of, which is YouTube<em>. </em>YouTube\u2019s great innovation, greatest success, the thing that has driven it to be a place where people are ingesting hundreds of millions of hours daily of video content, is the recommendation algorithm\u2014the \u201cup next\u201d part of YouTube,<em> </em>where, on the right side of your page, it feeds you another video after.</p><p>That recommendation algorithm, as my reporting and other people\u2019s reporting has shown over the years, brings people into\u2014people call it the rabbit hole, right? Where you watch something, let\u2019s say it\u2019s just a World War II explanation video, right? A history podcast of World War II that\u2019s not racist or anti-Semitic at all, but they\u2019re talking about Hitler a lot. They\u2019re talking about difficult subjects, maybe the Holocaust, something like that. And then you get another video, and that video is maybe just one-tenth of 1 percent, a little more extreme right? Or someone who\u2019s coming from a little bit more of a far-right perspective.</p><p>Fast forward, you can get people down into this funnel, and that is an algorithmic boost, and that\u2019s why I think this is important.</p><p><strong>Frum:</strong> Okay, I sometimes do go down World War II rabbit holes. I\u2019m interested in the subject like every Baby Boomer. And I find that as I keep going, what the algorithm serves me is increasingly technical content. Well, what was the difference between a 16-inch and a 14-inch naval gun in World War II? Was the 16-inch gun, in fact, better? It gets more technical, more specific, more wonky. And I think I\u2019m telling the algorithm, you know, that\u2019s what I want.</p><p>So there is the kind of thing where we say, <em>Ah, we\u2019re making it a little more Hitlery</em>. Yes, that\u2019s the algorithm, but that\u2019s the algorithm knowing you, your real self. And it used to be that in, like in 1975, CBS would say, <em>You know what? You want stuff that\u2019s a little more Hitlery than we\u2019re serving, but you\u2019re not going to get it.</em></p><p>And now the consumer is driving things. Isn\u2019t he or she? He. I think in World War II, Hitler\u2014</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> I think we\u2019re safe to say he\u2014watching the World War II videos. I agree with that, in part. But I think that there are other elements here. I was looking a little bit into\u2014and we talked a bit about discussing\u2014this new media ecosystem and the extremism that it can go towards.</p><p>And I\u2019ve been following her career somewhat closely, but looking a little bit more into Candace Owens and listening to a couple of popular things that she has put out. She\u2019s obviously a very extreme voice on the right, very conspiratorial. And there\u2019s a great column, a week ago in <em>The</em> <em>New York Times</em> by Michelle Goldberg about Candace Owens and how she has played into the conspiracy theory that Charlie Kirk was not killed by the man who was arrested. And actually had a media summit with Charlie Kirk\u2019s widow, Erica Kirk.</p><p>But something that Michelle notices in that piece, and I think is very apt, is that she, Candace Owens, draws a lot from the true-crime genre, which is an extremely popular genre of podcast and media now, and plays a little bit towards the digital sleuths on the internet.</p><p>So these are people who are, you know, vigilante investigators, right? They\u2019re taking all the information available on the internet, trying to follow the lead like they\u2019re a detective pursuing a cold case. And she does a very good job at that, at bringing people along for the hunt of information and giving them these breadcrumbs and telling them, you know, <em>This story\u2019s not right</em>. And I think that that is a part of why people who are looking for that, who are looking to play this role of detective, or who feel that we don\u2019t have the full story. <em>there\u2019s information out there; I can piece it together because I have the ability.</em> That is where I think the algorithm can intersect with a creator who is trying to manipulate. And then it can lead you into a path that gets you into a place that\u2019s a little more, as you put it, Hitlery, because I don\u2019t think people are necessarily, broadly speaking, just saying, <em>Yeah, that was good about World War II. I want some Hitler</em> <em>now</em>. Right? I think what it is, is they believe there\u2019s a conspiracy.</p><p><strong>Frum:</strong> Explain something that baffles me. So if I go on the internet, if I\u2019m having trouble getting the little disc battery into my key fob, my car-key fob, and I\u2019m flummoxed and the written instructions aren\u2019t helpful, and I go online to find a YouTube video\u2014say, how do I get the disc battery into the key fob?</p><p>If there\u2019s someone there saying, <em>Leave it on the doorstep and the leprechaun overnight with a little bit of milk, and the leprechauns will come and fix the key fob for you</em>\u2014you know what? I\u2019m skipping that one. That doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s gonna work.</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> Right.</p><p><strong>Frum: </strong>So why don\u2019t people have that response?</p><p>Like, there\u2019s a killing. The police have arrested somebody. There is a suspect. It may not be that person, but the idea that there\u2019s some global conspiracy of leprechauns who did it instead, that\u2019s pretty unlikely. As it is, they will save my key fob for me. Yes, I take the point about the digital-sleuth thing, but at some level, people have to have, like, a common-sense meter, don\u2019t they?</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> But what if, instead, right, it was someone who is making a video who was saying, <em>You\u2019re getting screwed by your car company. Your car company nickels-and-dimes you on all of the things when you take it in for service. They overcharge you. They\u2019re this big corporation, you know. They\u2019re owned by whatever shadowy people, right, who have their own agendas in whatever, who are using your money. And, you know, they\u2019re funding their indulgent lifestyles, and who knows what they\u2019re doing, right,when they take their private planes, X, Y, and Z?</em> A</p><p>And this battery thing, right, is actually a manifestation of this broader thing. There\u2019s something bigger about the fact that your battery dies too early, right, on your key fob. And that\u2019s the thing. Because it opens up this world to people where they say, <em>Okay, now, now I understand.</em></p><p>The unlock in my brain for why conspiracy theories are so popular now in, in culture\u2014they\u2019ve always been popular; obviously the paranoid mind is a fixture in all of history, but especially American history. These theories, however strange or stupid or completely implausible they might be on a given subject: They give people an understanding of why the world feels unfair or wrong or bad, right?</p><p>And in a moment where there are a lot of people who are struggling, who are very disenchanted, who feel that there is no predictable pathway to success or that the American dream is out of reach for them\u2014even something as small as the key-fob conspiracy explains one small bit of why they feel like crap all the time.</p><p><strong>Frum:</strong> One of the things I have taken from the past, from this Trump era, the past decade of discussion, is\u2014it\u2019s a trope. It\u2019s something we are supposed to say, that things are increasingly difficult for people. It\u2019s understandable that there\u2019s a lot of resentment and anger.</p><p>I find myself, maybe I\u2019m just becoming crankier, less and less patient with that. I mean, we live, if you\u2019re an American in the year 2026, you live at the apex, the summit of civilization. Never so much material prosperity, never so much medical prosperity. And in particular the science of preserving life and health has never been better, never approached what you have today.</p><p>So when you see people saying, <em>My conspiracy theory is to reject the gifts of modern medical science and to subject my child to measles.</em> So you know what? I don\u2019t believe it, that you\u2019re having such a tough time. All right? Anyway, if you are having such a tough time, I think that doesn\u2019t excuse you.</p><p>And if your response to having a tough time is to deny your child the measles vaccine, then your tough time may be a result of your own deficiencies, not something that society is doing. If you\u2019re gonna do something that callous, negligent, potentially homicidal to your child\u2014you\u2019re to blame. You are the problem.</p><p>It\u2019s not the bankers; it\u2019s not deindustrialization; it\u2019s not the crisis of modernity. It\u2019s you, dumb head. It\u2019s you. Vaccinate your child.</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> Well, first off, I fully agree that if you are denying your child vaccines or things like that, that is on you. I understand that there is this fatigue, right, with trying to rationalize the reasons why people are falling down these rabbit holes or doing ridiculous things. I kind of hold it in my mind slightly differently, which is that I\u2019m not seeing everyone as just these absolutely passive observers, but I do see people as being relatively easily manipulated.</p><p>When you combine this idea of <em>I am frustrated; I feel bad; I can\u2019t see the progress of modernity</em> <em>in this way</em>\u2014when you combine that with really savvy manipulators and then a culture that forms around all of that, a tribalism that forms around this, that, okay, it\u2019s not only that I\u2019m denying, I don\u2019t believe in vaccines, I\u2019m denying this; it becomes a group, a team, a thing, a cohort, a sense of belonging.</p><p>And that is a very strong psychological bond. And so it\u2019s not necessarily that I\u2019m saying these people don\u2019t have any agency, or that they can\u2019t be blamed for, you know, essentially endangering the lives of their children or doing whatever awful thing. But I see this as like all of these systems making it very hard for people to break out of that mold, to do the right thing, to go against the grain of those people.</p><p><strong>Frum:</strong> So while we\u2019re talking about agency, what are we going to do? So here we are, we\u2019re now co-manufacturers of this reality in a very modest way, but there we are. We\u2019re part of it. What do we do? How do we be forces for good and effective forces for good rather than forces for ill or ineffective forces for good?</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> I think that\u2019s really difficult. Something that our boss, Adrienne LaFrance, who\u2019s the executive editor of <em>The Atlantic</em>,<em> </em>said on a podcast I did with her recently, which was about\u2014we were covering the Epstein files, the first dump of all this.</p><p>And at the very end of the podcast, I asked, <em>Well, what the heck did we learn here?</em> There\u2019s all this information. And one thing that she said about this, the durability of the Epstein conspiracy theory is that people still want the truth, right? That is also at the heart of all of this conspiratorial crap that we are dealing with.</p><p>There are a lot of people who have this impulse, who want the truth, who believe they\u2019re not getting the truth, and that leads them down these difficult paths. But that is actually our job, right? We are purveyors of, in an ideal world, of that. We are trying to harness this; we are trying to do that.</p><p>So, you know, I almost think in some ways that the, whatever you want to call it, the mainstream media, you and me, whatever it is\u2014we need to take that back, I think, more strongly than we do. We can be a little milquetoast about this. I think we need to say that if you\u2019re on the hunt, if you\u2019re trying to be a digital vigilante investigator, then you need to be looking here for the truth, which is here, and we are the people who are going to, you know, do that job.</p><p><strong>Frum: </strong>One of my New Year\u2019s resolutions is I\u2019m going to not only refrain from using, but actually actively object, to the phrase <em>mainstream media</em>. Because if many times more people watched Candace Owens or Joe Rogan than CNN or the <em>PBS NewsHour</em>. If conspiracy media get much bigger views than <em>The Atlantic</em> or even <em>The New York Times</em>, they\u2019re the mainstream.</p><p>The crackpots are the mainstream. And so one of the great unlearnings we have\u2014there is a kind of tepidity, lukewarmness, that pervades what I would call the people who are trying to be honest, and a great passion that animates those who are, either consciously or unwittingly or gullibly, dishonest.</p><p>So one of the things I think we need to embrace, and this is what I\u2019m trying to do, is an idea\u2014you know, there\u2019s something a little countercultural about what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re doing what in 1975 would\u2019ve been considered mainstream. We\u2019re fact-checking. We\u2019re running things past lawyers.</p><p>If we make a mistake, we correct them. Two weeks ago, I made a mistake on air. I said something based on the information we had available at the time about the Bondi Beach killing, that there were eyewitness reports that the police had been slow. And I quoted those, or referenced those.</p><p>And a week later, when that turned out not to have been correct, I corrected myself. But those habits\u2014we need to understand that those are not the mainstream. The mainstream is paranoia, conspiracy, deception, and it is a countercultural act to stand up for integrity and truth and self-correction.</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> I love this because I fully do agree, and I think that this posture of having to apologize because you\u2019re a part of an institution or something like that\u2014I like the idea of reversing that, quite a bit. I think it\u2019s very strong. I think, too\u2014something that I have noticed that has been very, very frustrating to me, and I\u2019ve talked about this on a past episode a little bit, is this idea that so many of the things inside, let\u2019s just call them media institutions or professionalized media, right, that are there in order to build trust among readers and viewers or credibility, right?The idea of fact-checking. The ideas of editing. Those things have been truly weaponized against\u2014something I\u2019ve also found about the right-wing media as it\u2019s built up in the Trump era that\u2019s fascinating, is the absolute lack of editing. You know, they will do livestreams that are, you know, three, four hours long.</p><p>There\u2019s Joe Rogan\u2019s, not explicitly the right-wing media, but, like, his podcast as a template. You know, those episodes are often three hours\u2013plus long. There\u2019s this idea of no editing, of no fact-checking, of no polish in any sense. And the idea that behind it from them is we\u2019re giving you everything unvarnished.</p><p><em>Look at all these other people who are editing things. What are they hiding?</em> Where actually that\u2019s, you know, that\u2019s BS. That\u2019s just quality control.</p><p><strong>Frum:</strong> Not to be pedantic, but this is not a problem just for right-wing media. There are left-wing versions of this.</p><p>And there will be more. The extreme right got a certain head start. And I think that will not endure if this is the future. You know, one of the things, but you may raise this point, and it makes me think\u2014and this is something that again, that <em>The Atlantic</em> can really contribute.</p><p>So when modern buildings begin to be constructed in the late 19th century, you start with a steel frame and then you put on around it all this limestone and woodwork, to conceal the steel frame. And the modernist architecture\u2014you know, let\u2019s take all that limestone off and show people the steel frame.</p><p>We\u2019ll have the steel frame with the glass and they can see the integrity and honesty of the building and realize why the building stands up to all these many stories. I think that\u2019s a little bit the way professionalized media, that\u2019s a good term, responded. The steel frame was the structure of reporting and research and editing and fact-checking and legal checking.</p><p>And then it was hidden behind the writing. That was the limestone. And maybe we need to take the limestone off and show people a little bit more how the building works and bring people into the process and how we think, why we choose stories the way we do, why we choose not to do certain stories, and how we do our method.</p><p>Maybe that\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019re doing this very day, to talk a little bit about\u2014you know, every time we invite somebody, we\u2019re making a selection. Who do we choose? Who do we not choose? And in the podcast world, there are people who are, you know, that, well, such and such a person when he or she appeared on such and such a show got so many hits. And this other person who I\u2019m thinking of inviting has never been on a show, or when they were on a show, they got many fewer hits. Nonetheless, I\u2019m going with person No. 2, and maybe I need to talk more with my audience about why I\u2019ve chosen this person who is credible and knowledgeable, and whom I believe has something worth saying and not the other.</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> Yeah. This is always the tension here, right? And this is a little bit, too, where I bring the algorithms into play here. I think that the algorithms are optimized for this, like, illiberalism, this sensationalism. And I think right now that is something that is far more prevalent on the right.</p><p>These algorithms are helping them in an outsized way. So that\u2019s why I don\u2019t always know, when you say we\u2019re gonna be seeing a lot more of this type of content from, you know, from the left. I think that that\u2019s true, that, that the left is going to try to build out an ecosystem like this.</p><p>But it feels far less like it has a very specific political valence and much more of a valence of a kind of nihilism. And I, and that\u2019s obviously, it can be, you know, just as dangerous as anything.</p><p><strong>Frum:</strong> Well, it\u2019s not nihilism. It\u2019s anti-institutional of a different kind. And one of the things that\u2014when you and I talked in advance about what we were going to do, and I\u2019m showing the cladding, we did talk in advance about what the show would be\u2014some of the lessons we\u2019ve learned from doing this.</p><p>I\u2019ve tried some things that haven\u2019t worked, and one of the things I\u2019ve learned about this medium is it\u2019s not television. It looks like television, but it\u2019s not. So the way television interviews went or go, to the extent there is still television, is there would be somebody who is important, who had something they didn\u2019t want to say on television, and there would be a professional questioner whose job was to get the person who didn\u2019t want to say the thing to say that thing.</p><p>And if you watch, like, the Sunday-morning shows, this is the game in its most classic form.</p><p>And afterwards, the politician can congratulate himself because he went on TV, took 11 minutes of everybody\u2019s time, and said nothing of interest, and that\u2019s a win for him. And I thought, <em>You know what? That doesn\u2019t work anymore.</em> If you don\u2019t want to say something interesting, I don\u2019t know why I\u2019m asking people to spend 11 minutes, or in my case, 40 minutes with you.</p><p>I\u2019m only going to ask you if you are going to play the game, if you say, <em>You know what? I\u2019m here to communicate.</em> So I\u2019ve learned, invite fewer politicians because they\u2019re still in that mode of the value to them is what they don\u2019t say. And I\u2019ve also sort of stumbled along, and I didn\u2019t intend this, but I don\u2019t know that\u2014there\u2019s a lot of video that is about producing the 92nd clip where the people explode and yell at each other. And if you watch the whole thing, it\u2019s all like a ritualized performance of building up to the moment of confrontation, and the confrontation produces the viral video.</p><p>And I realized, <em>You know what? I don\u2019t find that tremendously useful either.</em> What I\u2019m increasingly looking for is: People have something they want to say; they agree with me that it should be said. We\u2019re not fighting each other about whether to say it. And we\u2019re also not looking to have a confrontation.</p><p>We\u2019re looking at this as a kind of cumulative, iterative building process that leaves the user, maybe not shocked at the end, but knowing something more than the user did when the user started.</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> This is why I\u2019ve always, in my career, I, rarely\u2014my version of this is rarely wanting to interview CEOs.</p><p>You have them on the thing. They have everything to lose in this situation. As you said, they\u2019re playing a prevent, defense, they\u2019re running out the clock, whatever you wanna call it, right? Yeah. On the whole interview. I agree with that. One thing I\u2019m curious about, since you have more experience in this realm.</p><p><strong>Frum:</strong> Weeks and weeks of it!</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> Weeks, yeah. I know. Hey, on the internet, though, we\u2019re talking dog years here, right? Do you think about the parasocial relationship? Like, are you thinking about building a relationship with audience members, people who are interested in coming for your thoughts, but also just, like, investing in that relationship with them and bringing them into your world, into your mind, into how you think? Do you look at it that way or do you say, <em>Nope, today, like, this is the subject I want people to learn about</em>\u2014a<em>nd I just think about it on that, on that very granular, episodic basis</em>?</p><p><strong>Frum:</strong> Very much the former, very much the former. Because when I think of this as being countercultural, I\u2019m saying, <em>This is a person you probably have never heard of I\u2019m going to talk to today.</em> But I think they\u2019re important; I think more important, they\u2019re a good-faith actor.</p><p>So even if we end up having some disagreements, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to lie to you. If I did, they wouldn\u2019t be here, and I\u2019m not here to fight with them. People I fight with, I don\u2019t want. This is my actual office. This is where I write. These are my actual books. These are my actual personal souvenirs.</p><p>If I weren\u2019t doing a show, the souvenirs would be arranged a little differently in the office than they are now. I wouldn\u2019t have them all behind my head where I can\u2019t look at them. I would have them in front of me where I can look at them. Yeah. But they\u2019d still, they\u2019d be in a different location in this actual room.</p><p>These are my actual paintings on the walls, and the books behind me are not chosen because I\u2019m trying to\u2014they\u2019re not my books or something I\u2019m trying to endorse. My books are arranged by alphabetical order and you\u2019re getting, you know, the <em>m</em>s \u2019cause we\u2019re in the middle of this.</p><p>So, and I do try to be quite expressive. I talk about what I think; I talk about the books I\u2019m reading. Because what I have to accept is that the days of Walter Cronkite are gone. The people who are imitating Walter Cronkite don\u2019t have his ethic. The people who are being watched are people who are building relationships.</p><p>And I think some of these relationships may leap the bound. I mean, I have many relationships that are not\u2014that began as parasocial that are now real. People I may not see very often, but whom I correspond with in a candid way. And I just think that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to have to be, because we can\u2019t leave the most powerful tools in modern media only in the hands of the devil\u2019s servants.</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> I fully agree. I mean, those are my friends there. I mean, it\u2019s a window. It\u2019s a window into this. What I have found as a challenge, though, is trying to play the game a little bit with the platforms while also trying to do what you are talking about, right?</p><p>Because the game\u2014not only does it reward the sensationalism, all this different stuff; it rewards having people on who have good YouTube channels already. Right? I mean, if you bring on\u2014I brought on my first episode this YouTuber Hank Green, right? And now YouTube allows you to have a little collaboration thing so you guys can share your audiences with each other.</p><p>And it incentivizes that game of\u2014instead of bringing on the person who no one\u2019s ever heard of, who\u2019s actually way smarter than everyone else here and can give you the conversation that is much more enriching, you have to sort of try to play this game. And similarly, trying to have a conversation about something that people might not think is that interesting\u2014it\u2019s not necessarily going to do as well as, <em>Hold on, let us jump on the Epstein news right after</em>. That is, you know, my most successful episode is chasing the news, is chasing the thing that YouTube\u2019s algorithm already knows is sticky. And I\u2019ve watched\u2014I would love to know if you\u2019ve seen this, because I cover this stuff. I\u2019m really interested in the dynamic, what I call platform dynamics, how the different content spreads around.</p><p>And I have watched us upload some of these videos to YouTube, and I\u2019ve watched them start to move in a really interesting, like, up into the right direction on the graph and then stall immediately. And it\u2019s, you\u2019re watching an algorithmic\u2014not suppression, because that\u2019s kind of ridiculous to say, but you\u2019re watching something happen, right?</p><p>It is moving and then it kind of stops. Either it\u2019s reached the audience of people that care in that sense, or\u2014I find that really hard because when we\u2019re talking about trying to do the work that we want to do in this good-faith way, in a way that is hopefully giving people some responsible tools to actually learn about the world in a way that we feel is credible and true, I think it makes me very frustrated to have to work against these powerful other forces that are goading you into being the worst version of yourself.</p><p><strong>Frum:</strong> Well, I share that feeling. It\u2019s true, of course, but you still have to lean against the wind. And one of the things I think a lot about, I don\u2019t want to make this a too-partisan political point, but I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m going to invoke Trump not to make a point specifically here about him\u2014but I think a lot of people look at the politics of the past decade and say, you know, <em>Above all, it was a giant waste of time.</em> So in 2015, the United States had a series of very serious enduring problems: climate change, we mentioned; public debt; the educational performance of children from the least advantaged backgrounds; the problem of bringing China peacefully into the world of commerce and applauding that they\u2019re raising so many people out of poverty, not letting them push the rest of the world around, but also trying to stay out of a war with them, too; many, many more.</p><p>And 10 years later, we\u2019ve made zero progress on any of them. It\u2019s just been a giant waste of time. We\u2019re fighting about whether or not one egomaniac actually put his name on the front of the nation\u2019s leading concert hall. What a stupid way for the world\u2019s greatest power to spend a decade.</p><p>So I think that. But what I also think is this: For those of us who have been through this experience, we\u2019ve made no progress over the past 10 years on these important, enduring chance questions. But we\u2019ve also learned something about defending things that are important. And it\u2019s made many people better people.</p><p>Many people become better versions of themselves. Many people have discovered things that were important that they didn\u2019t know. And a lot of us have had the experience of saying, you know\u2014I know for myself, I\u2019ll speak very personally. I was on my way out. Out of politics. I had reached a certain age; I\u2019d had certain personal reverses.</p><p>I wanted out, and it pulled me back. And I\u2019m not entirely happy to be back in that world. But I do have this feeling of, to some, and without being a megalomaniac with this, because it\u2019s very small, but it\u2019s true. If everybody in each of our small degree\u2014we\u2019re needed; we\u2019re doing something that\u2019s needed.</p><p>And in pushing back against the algorithmic machine on this platform, we\u2019re also doing something that\u2019s needed. And that\u2019s a very valuable human experience. And even if it fails, it\u2019s still valuable.</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> I\u2019m just, I\u2019m stuck on the idea of the non-apologetic, countercultural, we-are-the-underdog, in some sense, mentality that you\u2019ve noted here.</p><p>And just very candidly, it\u2019s very empowering. Because I think that there has been so much apologizing or trying to remain overly deferential to people who are trying to tear the world down because it\u2019s our job to be the rational, cool heads in the room.</p><p>And I think that coming from the perspective of\u2014these other places are outperforming. They have the bigger audiences\u2014and not trying to take the worst from them, but trying to take that kind of scrappiness, that mantle of being an insurgent, trying to be an insurgent force.</p><p>And I think that\u2019s really powerful. I would love for more stewards of, let\u2019s call it, again, professional or institutional media to look at it that way, because I think it\u2019s much more hardheaded. It\u2019s much more combative, it\u2019s much more\u2014it feels like it gives a purpose, right?</p><p>I feel like in the second Trump administration\u2014in the first Trump administration, the media seemed to have a pretty explicit purpose. Let\u2019s shine a light on this thing. Hopefully it will restore the pillars of democracy, or gird everyone, in that way.</p><p>And I think that there\u2019s been for the most part, broadly, a kind of lost-at-sea nature. Okay, this guy won a second time. What is our function? What do we do? Does what we do have any effect? And I think there\u2019s been this grasping, trying to find the purpose. And I think that that is something of a purpose that people can use, right?</p><p><strong>Frum:</strong> There have been so many human beings in so many historical situations, some of them so much more terrible and dangerous than anything we face\u2014soldiers and seemingly lost causes and metaphorical soldiers and metaphorically seemingly lost causes\u2014who just kept going with one thought: I\u2019m not gonna let the bastards win. And sometimes that\u2019s all you need.</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> I think that should be, that should be the new motto, right? Get rid of \u201cDemocracy dies in darkness.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not gonna let the bastards win.\u201d</p><p><strong>Frum:</strong> I. I. Emphasize on the I. And anyone who\u2019s watching, you\u2019re the I.</p><p>Yeah. One of the things I often point out, if you have one of these [David holds up his smartphone], and we all do, you have more communication power in your hand than Walter Cronkite ever commanded. So we all have to use it wisely. Think about what you share, think about what you trust, think about whom you believe, and encourage others to do the same.</p><p>And that\u2019s why we\u2019re also gonna encourage you to share what you do believe, which is this program, and Charlie\u2019s, and to join us in being co-publisher because that\u2019s what we all are. We\u2019re all co-publishers.</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> And I think, one, I have to say, when this is invoked\u2014you have all that communication power, and one of the best things you can do both for yourself but also for others is to know when not to use it. Yes. To know when to step away from it, you know?</p><p><strong>Frum:</strong> Yes, very true.</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> \u2019Cause that is a huge problem.</p><p><strong>Frum:</strong> Charlie, thanks so much for making the time for me today and congratulations on the new show.</p><p>We\u2019re co-publishing this. This is an interesting experiment, and may it flourish. Thank you.</p><p><strong>Warzel:</strong> Absolutely. Thank you.</p><p><strong>[<em>Music</em>]</strong></p><p><strong>Frum:</strong></p><p>Thanks so much to my Atlantic colleague Charlie Warzel for joining me this week. As I mentioned at the beginning of the show, my book of this week is a history: <em>The Trial of Madame Caillaux</em>. Caillaux, by the way, is spelled <em>C</em>-<em>A</em>-<em>I</em>-<em>L</em>-<em>L</em>-<em>A</em>-<em>U</em>-<em>X</em> for those unfamiliar with the peculiarities of French pronunciation. <em>The Trial of Madame Caillaux</em> was published in 1992. It\u2019s written by the historian Edward Berenson. And it is the story of the most sensational sex and murder trial in pre\u2013World War I France. So I\u2019m going to just take you through the basics of the facts before getting on to why I thought this book was interesting and relevant now. Joseph Caillaux, the husband of Madame Caillaux, was an important politician in pre\u2013World War I France. He was associated with the secular left in the highly complex politics of the Third Republic. At that time, the most important newspaper of the right was a paper called <em>Figaro</em>.</p><p>Right, in France, means pro-Catholic, pro-militarist. Left means more skeptical of militarism, more secular. Joseph Caillaux, Madame Caillaux\u2019s husband, had led a very checkered life, many affairs with many different women. Although financially, he was quite above board, sexually, he was very public in his flamboyant personal life. Madame Caillaux was his second wife. Both the women he married were divorced women.</p><p><em>Figaro</em> went on a campaign against him because of his political views, but they used his personal life. And they got hold of a cache, a group of personal letters that made it clear that Joseph Caillaux and his second wife, Henrietta Caillaux, had started their relationship while Joseph Caillaux was still married to his previous wife and while Henrietta Caillaux was still married to her previous husband. In other words, they hadn\u2019t divorced people and then married. They had started an extramarital affair, then divorced, then remarried.</p><p>Now, this kind of thing did happen, but it was never to be spoken of, and if it were brought into the light of day, it would be a tremendously shameful thing. And Henrietta Caillaux was indeed shamed. And so one day in March of 1914, she goes to a gun shop, buys a gun, tucks it into her muff, gets in her chauffeur-driven car, goes to the offices of the editor of <em>Le Figaro</em>, waits for him to emerge from his appointment, meets with him, shoots him dead, gets back into a chauffeur-driven car, and drives to the police station. That\u2019s March of 1914. In July, all of this goes on trial in a sensational, sensational case.</p><p>Now, it\u2019s a case that involves many complex and mysterious attitudes of the time. And this is why I thought it would be interesting to talk about today. Madame Caillaux argues that what happened to her was that she, a mere woman, unable to control her emotions, was so overcome by shame and rage over the exposure of her personal life in the pages of <em>Le Figaro</em>, that as in a kind of mental out-of-control state, a state of total uncontrollable passion, she went to a gun store, bought a gun, drove to the office of <em>Le Figaro</em>, waited for an hour, and shot the editor dead and then drove in the same car to the police station. She just couldn\u2019t control herself. And the jury bought it. The all-male jury bought it.</p><p>An all-male trial\u2014there was almost no woman present in the courtroom. They bought it, that she was so overcome by her emotions. And so the reason this book is interesting is because, the reason that this trial was worth resurfacing in 1992 was because of what it showed about this very different mentality of a very different time. The prosecution didn\u2019t fight the idea that if a woman were so overcome by emotion, she would be justified in shooting a man dead.</p><p>Instead, they tried to argue that she had acted in cold blood. In order to make the point that the Caillauxs were not behaving in a proper gendered male-female relationship, one of the things they pointed out was what really should have happened here, what really should have happened was Mr. Caillaux should have challenged the editor of <em>Le Figaro</em> to a duel and fought him instead of letting his wife do his dirty work for him. Somebody should have\u2014no problem with killing somebody or at least attempting to kill them, but it should have been the man, not the woman, who did it.</p><p>But the woman, because she did it, she was able to fall back on this excuse that she was overcome by passion. Now, as you read this book from this distance in time\u2014and of course, 1992 is now some distance in time as 1992 was from 1914 when all of these events happened\u2014you\u2019re struck by the strangeness and alienness of the mental atmosphere that is described in this trial of a world in which women were regarded as totally the playthings of their emotions, in which male honor required that this kind of private vengeance and that the sin here was not that there was private vengeance, but that the wife did it instead of the husband. And one way you can react to that is by reading the history of this bygone time and saying, <em>Weren\u2019t they foolish? Aren\u2019t we wiser?</em></p><p>But another thing that might happen, and this is why I found the book so interesting to read at the turn of the year 2025, is that also looking back at a time where people believed things that we would regard as pretty crazy, pretty irresponsible, pretty wicked, actually\u2014it makes you a little humble and think, <em>What do we believe that is going to look as crazy 100 years from now?</em> Maybe it\u2019s not that they were dumb and we\u2019re smarter. Oh, that\u2019s not impossible; maybe that\u2019s true. But maybe it\u2019s also true: They had a set of delusions that we can see through, and we hold a set of delusions that future generations will see through. Maybe we should have more awareness of the ways in which we might be wrong and understand that it\u2019s precisely those views of which we are most certain\u2014because one thing that everybody in the trial agreed upon was that if you were gripped by overwhelming passion then you were entitled to kill somebody who had insulted you. They all agreed on that. They just disagreed about who should have done it, the husband or the wife.</p><p>Maybe the things we are most certain about are exactly the things where we are most likely to be led astray. We talked a little bit in our conversation today about the rabbit holes of World War II history. One of the reasons to study history is to study things other than World War II. It\u2019s not just D-Day and Midway all the time. It\u2019s entering into the mentalities of a time that looked pretty close to our own. Pre-1914 France, they had the telephone, they had the motor car\u2014kind of clumsy versions of both, but they had them. They had revolvers, they had the mass press, but they also had ways of thinking that to us seemed completely strange. And how will we look to our grandchildren, and our great-grandchildren?</p><p>That\u2019s it for this week\u2019s and this year\u2019s edition of <em>The David Frum Show</em>. Happy New Year to all who are observing the passage of time from 2025 to 2026. The show will post on December 31st, but some of you may be watching it in the 250th anniversary year of American independence. So as we discussed at the opening of the show, whatever qualms and doubts and anxieties I expressed then, I hope this is a deeply meaningful quarter-millennium event for all Americans.</p><p>Thanks so much for watching.

    "abstract": "Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) have received a lot of attention in electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems and have become a better choice to generate green hydrogen than their proton exchange membrane counterparts owing to the non-acidic working conditions as well as the use of nonprecious metal catalytic electrodes. Albeit the safe operating conditions as well as the use of non-precious metals, the ion conductivity and technology readiness level of AEMs are significantly lower than their PEM counterparts. It is well accepted that the key factors that drive their performance are anion conductivity, water uptake and chemical stability. However, there exist several other parameters that influence not only the KPI\u2019s but also the overall electrochemical performance of AEMs. The objective of this study is to compile the various physical processes in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyser and focus on the dominant ones that define the performance of these membranes. We further propose appropriate methods to predict the KPIs using multiscale approach. In this report, we elaborately discuss the abovementioned points with a note that, this area still requires substantial research and profound understanding from both experimental and computational point of view. In this article, a comprehensive review on molecular dynamics simulation methods for anion exchange membranes is extensively discussed. We also briefly touch upon the data analytics-based approaches to predict ion conductivity in thesemembranes.",

Here, we combine molecular dynamics simulations with spectroscopic andelectrochemical experiments to elucidate how acetonitrile/water mixtures organize around the mixed-valence polyoxometalate[(Mn4O4)(V4O13)(OAc)3]n\u2013 across catalytically relevant redox states. Our results reveal a pronounced oxidation-state dependence:the reduced MnV3- species is surrounded by a dense, highly structured hydration shell even at low water contents, preferentiallyengaging terminal vanadate oxygen sites and partially displacing acetonitrile from the first solvation shell. By contrast, the oxidizedMnV2- and MnV1- show substantially weaker water structuring and largely oxidation-state\u2013insensitive acetonitrile organization.These microscopic solvation motifs are directly reflected in experiment: spectroscopic titrations reveal the emergence of hydrogen-Bond formation at V=O groups and Jahn\u2013Teller\u2013driven asymmetric solvent accumulation accompanied by ligand exchange, whileElectrochemical measurements indicate reduced diffusioncoefficients and diminished redox features at higher water contents, consistent with ion-pair\u2013mediated aggregation observed in MD simulations. Together, these results establish oxidation state as a keycontrol parameter for solvent organization around polyoxometallate water-oxidation catalysts and provide a molecular rationalefor the enhanced activity yet limited stability window of MnVn-  species in acetonitrile/water mixtures.",

    "abstract": "Biomarkers are measurable changes associated with physiological or pathophysiological processes in the body. Urine, not strictly regulated by homeostatic mechanisms, accumulates extensive variable information and reflects changes in the body earlier and more sensitively, making it an excellent source for biomarker discovery. However, long-distance transport of urine samples usually requires a strictly maintained cold chain throughout the process, resulting in high costs and operational challenges. Here, we propose a urine sample processing method that uses brief heating to inhibit bacterial proliferation and protein degradation. A single urine sample was equally divided into three groups: a pre-heated transport group, a non-heated transport group, and a -80 frozen storage control group, with five replicates in each group. Both the pre-heated and non-heated transport groups were transported simultaneously across northern and southern China for five days under ambient temperature conditions. Samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that the intra-group overlap rates of identified proteins within the groups treated with 65 water bath heating for 15 minutes and -80 frozen storage were 97.1% and 97.5%, respectively, demonstrating high reproducibility. There were no significant differences in the number or types of urinary proteins identified between these two groups, with an inter-group overlap rate of 99.9%. Additionally, the pre-heated transport group and frozen storage control group showed no significant difference in the number of bacterial-derived peptides and proteins identified. In contrast, significantly more bacterial-derived peptides and proteins were identified in the non-heated transport group than in both the pre-heated transport and frozen storage control groups. This indicates that heating effectively suppresses bacterial counts in urine samples during five days of transport at ambient temperatures. This approach provides a more economical and convenient solution for long-distance transport of urine samples, eliminating the need for cold chain transportation or preservatives. We also recommend using consistent urine processing methods within the same study to minimize technical variability.",

Enzymes therefore dynamically sample conformations with varying catalytic activity. However, it remains largely unexplored whether evolution can exploit the conformational dynamics between sub-states to improve activity. Here, we dissect the evolutionary trajectory of the {beta}-lactamase OXA-48 toward improved ceftazidime hydrolysis. Evolution relieved conformational bottlenecks by promoting alternate functional sub-states, gradually shifting the rate-limiting step from substrate binding to sub-state interconversion, and finally to the chemical step. Reorganization of the conformational landscape enhanced OXA-48's ability to hydrolyze ceftazidime and introduced a trade-off in its native activity against meropenem. This trade-off stemmed from catalytic incompatibility between the native and the evolved sub-state populations. Our findings highlight the transitions between functional sub-states as a mechanism of natural selection, shaping functional divergence and offering new strategies for enzyme and antibiotic engineering.",

The CRISPR-Cas13b system, specifically the PspCas13b subtype, has emerged as a promising programmable antiviral tool capable of targeting viral RNA with high specificity. However, the efficacy of Cas13b-based interventions relies heavily on the design of potent and conserved CRISPR RNA (crRNA) spacer sequences, a task complicated by high viral genetic diversity. Unlike CRISPR-Cas9, which targets double-stranded DNA in eukaryotic genomes, Cas13b directly targets single-stranded RNA, making it ideally suited for RNA virus therapeutics; however, existing computational tools predominantly focus on Cas9 DNA targeting or Cas13d for mammalian transcript knockdown, leaving a significant gap for Cas13b-specific viral antiviral design. In this paper, we propose a computational pipeline and machine learning framework for the rational design of high-efficacy Cas13b guide RNAs targeting all four Dengue serotypes. Our approach integrates large-scale genomic data extraction, conservation analysis, and a novel in silico optimization module for guide RNA (gRNA) sequences, based on recently reported Cas13b design rules (e.g., 5' GG motif preference, Cytosine penalties). To predict targeting efficiency, we benchmark classical machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) against foundation model-based predictors (Nucleotide Transformer, RNA-FM) using a dataset of experimentally validated spacers. Our results demonstrate that classical feature-engineered models significantly outperform deep learning approaches when trained on experimentally validated gRNA datasets in low-data regimes. We identify highly conserved, optimized crRNA candidates, including several pan-serotype guides with predicted high potency. This work establishes a baseline for Cas13b efficiency prediction and provides a robust computational resource for accelerating the development of CRISPR-based antivirals against Dengue and other RNA viruses.",

To systematically identify genes that increase exclusively at the protein level upon PMF collapse, we performed a joint proteomic and RNA-seq screen. The screen revealed 10 candidates (six mitochondrial), including the vitamin B12 chaperone MMADHC and cytosolic B12-dependent methionine synthase (MTR). MMADHC is short-lived across cell types and we show that its levels increase with PMF collapse. MMADHC stabilization precedes PINK1 activation in a time course of increasing mtDNA depletion, suggesting greater sensitivity to PMF collapse. MMADHC accumulates in mitochondria with LONP1 inhibition but in the cytosol upon PMF collapse, likely due to mitochondrial import failure. Cytosol-stabilized MMADHC increases MTR levels and activity. Altogether, the mitochondrial PMF regulates the cytosolic B12-dependent MTR, integral to one-carbon metabolism, by controlling the stability and compartmentalization of the B12 chaperone MMADHC.",

This confinement can be described using low-dimensional manifolds. Leveraging information geometry, we developed a method to quantify cell state transition manifolds using single-cell RNA sequencing data. With this approach, each single cell is represented as a multivariate Gaussian distribution and is associated with a Fisher information matrix. We analyzed variations in the Fisher information matrix and its eigenvalue spectrum during cell state transitions. Our results reveal pronounced sloppiness in single cells, where cell state is sensitive to only a few specific combinations of parameters. Importantly, the degree of sloppiness fluctuates during cell state transitions. We found that critical transitions are associated with changes in the so-called stiff parameters. Notably, parameters identified as stiff exhibit low velocities and minimal fluctuations, whereas sloppy parameters display higher velocities and larger fluctuations. These findings indicate that cells fine-tune sensitive directions with caution while permitting greater flexibility along sloppy directions, revealing a principle of least action confining the paths taken during state transitions. During transitional stages, fluctuations and velocities increase were observed on stiff parameters, reflecting enhanced dynamical activity as cells navigate through critical regions of the manifold. Thus, we propose a new framework for analyzing single-cell dynamics. The low dimensionality of cell state transitions is characterized through sloppiness analysis, while changes in the Fisher information spectrum reveal shifts in cell dynamic modes.",

Adding lateral growth as an essential (non-equilibrium) ingredient to the known equilibrium ones (randomness and interface relaxation), the Kardar&amp;ndash;Parisi&amp;ndash;Zhang (KPZ) equation succeeded in finding (via the dynamic renormalization group) the correct exponents for flat d=1 substrates and (spatially and temporally) uncorrelated randomness. It is this interplay which gives rise to the unique, non-Gaussian scaling properties characteristic of the specific, universal type of non-equilibrium roughening. Later on, the asymptotic statistics of process h(x) fluctuations in the scaling regime was also analytically found for d=1 substrates. For d&amp;gt;1 substrates, however, one has to rely on numerical simulations. Here we review a variational approach that allows for analytical progress regardless of substrate dimensionality. After reviewing our previous numerical results in d=1, 2, and 3 on the time evolution of one of the functionals&amp;mdash;which we call the non-equilibrium potential (NEP)&amp;mdash;as well as its scaling behavior with the nonlinearity parameter &amp;lambda;, we discuss the stochastic thermodynamics of the roughening process and the memory of process h(x) in KPZ and in the related Golubovi&amp;#263;&amp;ndash;Bruinsma (GB) model, providing numerical evidence for the significant dependence on initial conditions of the NEP&amp;rsquo;s asymptotic behavior in both models.

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked dozens of genetic loci to type 1 diabetes (T1D). The IFIH1 gene, which encodes the double-stranded RNA sensor MDA5, is one such locus. The E627* single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in IFIH1 is associated with protection against T1D, while the A946T variant is linked to increased risk. While the E627* variant has been shown to result in a truncated protein and dampen type I interferon (IFN) signaling, its specific role in human pancreatic islet health and function remains unclear. We hypothesized that MDA5627* would protect islet cells from stress-induced dysfunction, identity loss, and cell death. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we introduced the E627* and A946T variants into human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) derived from a T1D patient. We differentiated these hPSCs into stem cell-derived islets (SC-islets) and treated them with IFN, poly(I:C), and coxsackievirus B3, an enterovirus implicated in T1D pathogenesis. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and an array of functional assays, we investigated the variant impact on both whole SC-islets and their individual cell populations. Our analysis revealed that SC-islets, and their {beta}, , and {delta} cell subpopulations, harboring the MDA5627* variant exhibit an attenuated immune response to the various stressors compared to MDA5946T cells. We also report unique, cell-type-specific transcriptional responses that vary across variants. Notably, MDA5627* SC-islets showed reduced apoptosis rates and viral genome expression, as well as attenuated negative effects on mitochondrial function and insulin secretion in response to stress. Overall, our findings demonstrate that a clinically relevant MDA5 variant confers protection by dampening stress-mediated transcriptional responses, reducing cell dysfunction, and preventing apoptosis. These insights provide a mechanistic framework for understanding T1D pathogenesis and offer new avenues for developing preventative therapies.",

    "abstract": "There is a widely held perception that science is becoming more international\u2014through multi-national collaborations\u2014and interdisciplinary, drawing on knowledge from multiple domains. However, these hypothesized trends have not yet been quantitatively characterized. With the publication metadata from OpenAlex, we examine trends in two groups of journals: disciplinary journals in natural sciences, life sciences, social sciences, and multidisciplinary journals that publish articles in multiple fields. Supporting existing perceptions, we find an almost universal trend towards increasing internationalization of both sets of journals. Nevertheless, we find disparities: medicine journals are less international than journals in other disciplines and do not increase their levels of internationalization, whereas physics journals appear to be segregating between those that are international and those that are not. We also find that multidisciplinary journals have undergone significant shifts in their disciplinary focuses over the past century, whereas disciplinary journals appear to have largely maintained their degree of interdisciplinarity.",

    "abstract": "Investigation of the bacterial pathogen <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> is complicated by extensive horizontal gene transfer: a process which disrupts phylogenetic signals and impedes our understanding of population structure. The ability to consistently identify <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> lineages is important for surveillance of this increasingly antimicrobial resistant organism, facilitating efficient communication regarding its epidemiology; however, conventional typing systems fail to reflect <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> strain taxonomy in a reliable and stable manner. Here, a <i>N. gonorrhoeae</i> genomic lineage nomenclature, based on the barcoding system of Life Identification Number (LIN) codes, was developed using a refined 1430 core gene MLST (cgMLST). This hierarchical LIN code nomenclature conveys lineage information at multiple levels of resolution within one code, enabling it to provide immediate context to an isolate\u2019s ancestry, and to relate to familiar, previously used typing schemes such as Ng cgMLST v1, 7-locus MLST, or NG-STAR clonal complex (CC). Clustering with LIN codes accurately reflects gonococcal diversity and population structure, providing insight into associations between genotype and phenotype for traits such as antibiotic resistance. These codes are automatically assigned and publicly accessible via the <a href=\"https://pubmlst.org/organisms/neisseria-spp\">https://pubmlst.org/organisms/neisseria-spp</a> database.",

    "abstract": "<p><img alt=\"biorxiv_logo_homepage7-5-small.png\" src=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/sites/default/files/images/biorxiv_logo_homepage7-5-small.png\" /></p>Alternative splicing is a key gene regulatory process that diversifies the proteome and controls gene dosage. Previous studies have detected aging-associated splicing changes across various tissues. However, their use of bulk RNA-seq obfuscates the impacted cell-types and may confound cell-type proportion changes with cell-intrinsic ones. We present a framework that first assembles and maps alternative splicing events in appropriate single cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq), then applies LeafletFA, a probabilistic model that discovers coordinated splicing programs (SPs) without requiring prior knowledge of cell types or clinical information, such as age. Applying this framework to over 200,000 cells from mouse and human Smart-seq2 multi-tissue atlases, we discovered global and cell type specific aging-associated SPs. In mice, integrating SPs with gene expression significantly improved age prediction in 46 of 76 tissue-cell types tested. We identified the RNA-binding protein textit{Snrnp70} as a key upstream mediator driving the shift from youthful to aged SPs. To test evolutionary conservation of these patterns, we employed transfer learning to map the murine splicing dictionary onto human transcriptomes. This revealed a conserved \"youth\" program (SP4) that is maintained in quiescent endothelial tissues but lost in high-turnover organs. We identified a conserved, age-dependent alternative 5' splice site usage in the splicing factor textit{SRSF5} as a molecular marker of this program in both species. Our work establishes alternative splicing as a coordinated, evolutionarily conserved dimension of cellular aging and provides LeafletFA as an open-source tool for single-cell splicing analysis.",

    "abstract": "<p>Every year in late December, my childhood home transformed into a vision of American bliss. We\u2019d gather to ornament a tree, drape string lights around the house, and sit down to an elaborate feast. Not long after dawn the next day, while our little sister still slept, my brother and I would impatiently sneak downstairs to see our gifts, which we understood to have been delivered by a kindly old man. It could have been a scene out of <em>A Christmas Story</em>. Except we weren\u2019t celebrating Christmas. My family was celebrating the Soviet version of New Year\u2019s, a holiday that resembles Christmas in nearly every way, except that it takes place almost a week later and excludes Jesus, God, or any other signifier of religion. We were keeping the national tradition alive in suburban America, years after the country that invented it had dissolved.</p><p>Soviet New Year\u2019s began as a ritual in a country where all the religious rituals were gone. Long before the 1917 revolution that brought them to power, the leaders of the Soviet Union had decried religion as, in Karl Marx\u2019s phrase, the opium of the masses. Their officially atheist government suppressed many kinds of spiritual observance, including Christmas. But by the mid-1930s, Soviet leaders sensed that people needed something to take the edge off in the dead of winter, a carnivalesque custom of the sort that Christmas once provided. So they took the most fun parts of the Christian holiday and plopped them on New Year\u2019s.</p><p>It became arguably the most important holiday on the country\u2019s calendar. Other celebrations tended to come with historical significance, such as the anniversary of the revolution and of the Soviets\u2019 victory in World War II. But New Year\u2019s, at its core, was about nothing more and nothing less than family: a chance to come together and take stock. That may be a big reason it survived the Union\u2019s dissolution. Even after religious institutions were allowed to conduct their services without government interference and their holidays were acknowledged, New Year\u2019s remained important for both the people who had left the region and those who still lived there.</p><p>But today, Soviet New Year\u2019s customs are in danger of slipping away or evolving beyond recognition. Some people still celebrate the holiday the old way, with their families and gifts. Many, though, are establishing new practices that reflect new values and new political circumstances: Wars between former Soviet republics, for instance, and the ways that political leaders have used the momentous nature of the night for their own gains, have changed how people celebrate. A holiday that once felt embedded in the identity and culture of the Soviet people may soon become untethered from its history.</p><hr /><p>Soviet New Year\u2019s began at a time when morale in the country was, in general, low. It was the 1930s, and Ukraine had <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/10/red-famine-anne-applebaum-ukraine-soviet-union/542610/?utm_source=feed\">suffered</a> one of the worst man-made famines in world history. The idea to bring joy to the winter came from a Communist Party leader named Pavel Postyshev, who had been one of the famine\u2019s administrators. During an intimate car ride around Moscow with General Secretary Joseph Stalin and a future successor, Nikita Khrushchev, Postyshev proposed reviving the tradition of trees, but tied to a secular holiday. Stalin enthusiastically endorsed the idea, and in 1935, a letter from Postyshev appeared in <em>Pravda</em>, the official newspaper of the party\u2019s central committee, arguing that all Soviet children should get to experience the cheer that the bourgeoisie\u2019s children once had: \u201cLet\u2019s organize a fun New Year\u2019s Eve party for the kids.\u201d</p><p>Postyshev\u2019s idea spread like a wildfire in reverse\u2014trees sprang up across the Soviet Union. The first year, delegates from the local party leadership and schoolteachers gathered parents and instructed them in how to decorate a tree. In some schools, Grandfather Frost, a Santa Claus equivalent, distributed gifts to kids. Soon, families adopted the new practice as their own. But Postyshev never got to see the extent of it. In the \u201930s, Stalin consolidated power, punishing anyone he suspected of opposing him, including Postyshev\u2014who was executed in 1939. The holiday soon became another tool for Stalin to reinforce his power and centrality in Soviet life. \u201cThe cheerful, happy children sang, danced, recited poems, praising in the songs and poems of their beloved Stalin, who gave them a joyful and happy life,\u201d one 1938 newspaper report read.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/11/understanding-stalin/380786/?utm_source=feed\">Read: Understanding Stalin</a>]</i></p><p>After Stalin died, in 1953, the holiday\u2019s focus turned away from politics. In 1956, Khrushchev delivered a speech criticizing Stalin\u2019s \u201ccult of personality\u201d and his purges, signaling to people that they could drop the anxieties about political correctness that had constricted their lives in the Stalin era. The film <em>Carnival Night</em>, released that same year, captured the iconoclastic mood. In it, workers resist the efforts of their company director to organize a New Year\u2019s celebration in which everything is acceptable to the people above him and no fun for those below. He plans to deliver a speech, but a worker persuades a magician to make the text disappear; when the director later goes to grab it, he instead finds a string of scarves and other knickknacks. The company director, representing a self-aggrandizing political blowhard, is humiliatingly sidelined, and the workers have a grand time.</p><p>By the time my dad started celebrating New Year\u2019s in Moscow, in the \u201960s, most of the elements of the holiday I would come to know as a kid were present: family dinner, gifts, and a decorated tree. It had become an unquestioned fulcrum of Soviet life. If there was a custom of reading poems or singing songs in Khrushchev\u2019s honor, it wasn\u2019t ubiquitous. Once the country\u2019s leaders began giving an annual New Year\u2019s address, in 1970, these speeches weren\u2019t taken seriously. They were filled with empty platitudes, \u201cvoid of meaning,\u201d according to <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/12476/9780399564178\"><em>The Invention of Russia</em></a>, by the journalist Arkady Ostrovsky<em>.</em> \u201cThese addresses were merely a prompt for popping the corks from bottles.\u201d</p><p>That cork-popping continued even as the Soviet Union dissolved and many people left the region. I was born in Moscow in 1996, five years after the fall of the Union, and we moved to upstate New York five years after that. For a long time, the New Year\u2019s my family celebrated was stuck in amber, the old tree-and-gifts version. In the former Soviet republics, people still considered the day significant but changed some of the customs. In Armenia, for instance, once religious holidays were again allowed, religious institutions attached themselves to New Year\u2019s. From the early 1990s until 2023, the head of the national Church would deliver a midnight address right before the country\u2019s president or prime minister. Tigran Simyan, a professor at Yerevan State University who studies the evolution of New Year\u2019s in Armenia and the post-Soviet world, told me, \u201cOur happy New Year, for us, is more important than Christmas.\u201d</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/11/when-the-soviets-voted/672039/?utm_source=feed\">Read: When the Soviets voted</a>]</i></p><p>Politics also returned to the holiday after the Soviet Union\u2019s fall. In Russia, the seeming end of single-party rule and a brief moment of political competition revived the status of the New Year\u2019s address. It was a rare time when all eyes were focused on the same speaker. The Russian Federation\u2019s first president, Boris Yeltsin, strategically resigned on December 31, 1999, giving his handpicked successor, Vladimir Putin, the opportunity to introduce himself during a midnight address as the millennium turned. \u201cThe ritual was unmistakably staged,\u201d Ostrovsky writes in <em>The Invention of Russia</em>. \u201cThe New Year\u2019s address had greater symbolic value than any election.\u201d</p><p>In more recent times, young Russians have tended to focus on partying on New Year\u2019s Eve. But the many people who maintain the Soviet way of celebrating at home with family might still put on Putin\u2019s address. Once again, a popular film captures the mood. The plot of 2010\u2019s <em>Yolki</em> is almost the exact opposite of <em>Carnival Night</em>\u2019s. Whereas the 1956 film is about a collaborative effort to prevent a speech, <em>Yolki</em> features people across the country working together to help a girl on her quixotic quest to insert a phrase into the president\u2019s midnight address, granting the address central importance. <em>Yolki</em> was the first in what became Russia\u2019s most financially successful non-animated film franchise, despite the series\u2019 declining artistic and entertainment value. Its 12th sequel, set as ever on New Year\u2019s Eve, came out this December.</p><hr /><p>Eventually, politics\u2019 creep back into the New Year\u2019s holiday began to affect the way my family celebrated in the United States. Although for years, none of us took what Putin said in his address too seriously, my grandparents still put it on out of habit. But as his regime grew more repressive and violent, we let that go. The way I remember it, we stopped after Russia\u2019s initial invasion of Ukraine, in 2014, deciding that we didn\u2019t need to support Putin\u2019s rule on our holiday. But my dad dates our move away from the midnight address to earlier, in 2012. That year, Putin stepped through a loophole in constitutional term limits and <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/03/putins-power-grab-and-the-russian-awakening/253918/?utm_source=feed\">returned to the presidency</a>, then brutally suppressed the protests that followed. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to hear him anymore,\u201d my dad told me recently.</p><p>After Russia\u2019s full-scale <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/category/russias-invasion-ukraine/?utm_source=feed\">invasion of Ukraine</a>, in February 2022, some Ukrainians\u2019 New Year\u2019s celebrations stopped. \u201cWhat is there to celebrate when there is a war?\u201d a Ukrainian soldier serving on the front line asked <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/01/01/ukrainian-soldiers-mark-a-third-new-year-on-the-frontlines-as-russian-attacks-continue\"><em>Euronews</em></a> last New Year\u2019s. Meanwhile, I spent last New Year\u2019s in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, where clubs had just been closed for weeks in deference to protests over the government pausing its European Union accession bid. Though some young people I talked with were spending the night with their family, many spilled out onto Rustaveli Avenue in the city center for a combination party, protest, and celebration. Without a single state to hold it together, and so many interstate conflicts, the Soviet New Year\u2019s tradition is splintering across the Soviet diaspora.</p><p><i>[<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2025/09/what-us-can-learn-georgia-protests/684040/?utm_source=feed\">Read: What I learned from the Georgia protests</a>]</i></p><p>Perhaps soon the holiday will become unrecognizable from its former iteration, especially as the people who remember its origins adapt to new cultures or pass away. My own family no longer makes a point of gathering on the holiday. In part, that\u2019s because my siblings and I have gotten older, scattered, and given in to assimilationist pressure\u2014the fear of missing out on the American custom of partying with our friends on New Year\u2019s. But we\u2019ve also lost the center of gravity that held us to the Soviet tradition. Early in November, my last surviving grandmother suffered a stroke, which paralyzed most of her body, leaving only her eyes and one arm fully mobile. Her grandfather, my great-great-grandfather, became a Bolshevik in 1905 and participated in the three revolutions that led to the establishment of the Soviet Union. His son, her father, wrote and disseminated anti-religious propaganda. Much of my family\u2019s adherence to the holiday might very well be because of this history. On Thanksgiving, days before my grandmother died, I told her I was researching our holiday tradition. She squeezed my hand and blinked knowingly.</p><p>Watching the tradition slip away feels like losing part of the Soviet and post-Soviet identity that\u2019s defined my family for more than a century. I feel a grief that\u2019s hard to disentangle from my grief for the people who passed the tradition on to me. But looking back on how my family has acted in decisive moments, I\u2019m also aware of an opportunity. My forefathers helped form the Soviet identity and its rituals, even before there was a country to promote them. Likewise, during and after the Soviet Union\u2019s existence, although politicians repeatedly imposed a tone that fit their priorities, my family chose how to spend the day. Ultimately, the common people reshaped the holiday to suit their needs and values. Their examples prove that people can make their own traditions, with whatever ideals they inherit.</p><hr /><p><small><em>\u200b\u200bWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

Bioinformatics analyses and molecular dynamics simulations of Class II (MnP and VP) and Class III (horseradish peroxidase, HrP) structures indicate that the Trp residue in HrP has the highest orientational factor and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency. By contrast, Trp residues in MnP and VP display low FRET efficiency due to unfavorable orientation factors despite their proximity to the heme. Steady-state fluorescence experiments confirmed this low FRET efficiency, showing strong emission in MnP and VP but weak emission in HrP. This decreased Trp-to-heme energy transfer appears to minimize competition between direct FRET and long-range electron transfer (LRET), allowing electrons to flow from bulky lignin substrates to the heme center. Such a mechanism likely provided a selective advantage during the evolution of Class II peroxidases, facilitating efficient lignin degradation at the enzyme surface.",

Nonetheless, incorporating bioactive ligands into the nanoclusters poses a significant challenge, possibly due to complex metallophilic interactions and incompatibility with typical synthetic conditions. In this work, we developed a straightforward method for the synthesis of an atomically precise gold nanocluster capped with a carbohydrate ligand, trehalose, Au25Tre18, in one step and in 55% yield. The formation of the nanocluster was enabled by using a mild reducing agent, t-butylamine borane, in a biphasic condition. The structure was confirmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry, optical absorption spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). 2D DOSY NMR gave a diffusion coefficient of 1.93 \u00d7 10-10 m2s-1 and the hydrodynamic diameter of 1.88 nm for Au25Tre18. The CD spectrum of Au25SG18 indicated chirality, having features differing from other chiral Au25 nanoclusters. The aqueous solution of is stable at elevated temperatures, e.g., 80 oC. In a thiourea (TU)-triggered release assay, Au25Tre18 exhibited enhanced antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis, showing a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) four times lower than that of its analogous nanocluster capped with glutathione, Au25SG18. Treating the bacteria at 1\u00d7MIC of Au25Tre18/TU resulted in complete eradication of bacteria, whereas bacteria treated with Au25SG18/TU at the same concentration continued to grow.",

We combined experimental and computational approaches to examine the growth of the HBNs of water and hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), constrained by an aprotic cosolvent. We independently employed vibrational frequency shift of an acetonitrile probe, 1H NMR chemical shift of an aniline probe, and molecular dynamics with machine learning interatomic potentials, to demonstrate the increase in the hydrogen bond strength with the growth of the HBNs. Finally, using vibrational spectroscopy of a titratable probe, we established that not only the hydrogen bond strength, but also the acidity of HFIP is affected by the changes in the network geometry.

CausalGRN first mitigates pervasive spurious partial correlations in sparse scRNA-seq data through a novel adaptive thresholding correction, enabling robust inference of an undirected graph. It then orients this graph using observed perturbation outcomes. The resulting directed GRN can be used to predict the downstream effects of novel perturbations via network propagation. Across both simulations and diverse experimental datasets, CausalGRN substantially outperforms existing approaches in network reconstruction accuracy and in predicting the effects of unseen perturbations, providing a principled bridge from perturbation data to causal gene regulation.",

We aim to use quantum computing to guide the discovery of covalent inhibitors for the treatment of the rare disease myotonic dystrophy type I. Modelling the formation of a chemical bond in the context of the rest of the inhibitor and the protein is a challenge, because of the size of the systems of interest, the intricacies of the electronic structure where the importance of electron correlation may vary between reactant and transition states, and the extensive sampling of configurational space that is often required. We are developing an efficient hybrid quantum-classical framework to address the accuracy and scalability limitations of conventional computational drug design approaches. A quantum-enhanced density functional approximation is developed based on data from computation on neutral-atom quantum hardware, which can then be deployed within conventional quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations. Our quantum-enhanced framework can be systematically updated as more capable quantum processors become available, heralding the prospect of using quantum-derived data to train improved density functional approximations and, ultimately, to support a wide range of drug design efforts.",

These calcified crystals are further characterized by producing molecular structures of the underlying DNA lattice via X-ray diffraction and Ca phasing. We show the resistance of calcified crystals to degradation by serum nuclease. By studying the deintercalation and intercalation of ethidium bromide as a drug analog, we confirm that calcium carbonate addition allows for tunable pore-size to enable selective drug-release.

For reaction barriers and water clusters, some of us earlier found that HF-DFT succeeds not because the HF density is accurate, but due to cancellation of negative functional-driven error (FE) by positive density-driven error (DE). Since DE, as defined here, is biased toward the self-consistent DFA density and against the HF density, the DE of the HF density is referred to as non-variational density over-localization (NVDO). In this work, we show that interaction energy errors in halogen- and chalcogen-bonded complexes in the B30 data set are not dominated by density-driven error. Instead, HF-DFT again succeeds through FE\u2013DE cancellation. Benchmark Kohn\u2013Sham inversions of coupled-cluster densities for NH3\u2026ClF, Cl-\u2026ClF, Cl-\u2026SF2, Cl-...SCF2, and Cl-\u2026PF3 provide strong evidence for this cancellation. For additional complexes, we employ the long-range-corrected hybrid LC\u03c9PBE as a proxy for electron-transfer errors in the exact density. We also examine several self-interaction correction (SIC) methods and find significant improvement from FLOSIC. We point out common features of the density errors in the NH3\u2026ClF, Cl-\u2026ClF complexes and three transition states, arguing that significant density-driven errors of energy arise only from electron-transfer errors. We also highlight a common feature in our present and previous work: long bonds can lead to non-negligible functional-driven self-interaction error of the energy from otherwise-accurate semi-local functionals in transition states, water clusters, and halogen or chalcogen bonds.",

To this end, we evaluated the extremophilic archaeon Acidianus manzaensis grown on ESA01-E Mars analog material as a model organism. We exposed cell-mineral mixtures to one month of desiccation and two weeks of Mars-like conditions in a Mars simulation chamber to evaluate the potential for cell survival after exposure to these conditions. In the search for reliable biomarkers in other planetary environments, such as Mars, molecules that are stable over geological timescales while preserving information indicative of their potential biological origin are crucial. Thiophene-bearing quinones fulfill these requirements, and thiophenes, which are their basic moieties, have been discovered on Mars. Therefore, we analyzed the thiophene-bearing quinone composition of A. manzaensis using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and discussed potential molecular alterations. Successful re-cultivation after one month of desiccation and two weeks of exposure to Mars-like conditions proved the durability of the organism and its capability for cell recovery after exposure to extreme conditions, paving the way for further investigation.",

The most common resolutions are fairly <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/research-products/report/aei-political-report-the-state-of-the-nation-the-publics-crystal-ball-and-new-years-resolutions/\">predictable</a>: financial resolutions, like saving more money or paying down debt (51 percent in 2019); eating healthier (51 percent); exercising more (50 percent); and losing weight (42 percent).</p> \n \n<p>Old Janus is pretty annoyed at this point, I imagine, because our resolutions overwhelmingly fail.</p> \n</blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/12/new-years-resolutions-will-make-you-happier/617439/?utm_source=feed\">Read the full article.</a></p><hr /><p><b>Culture Break</b></p><img alt=\"multicolored film reel\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/media/newsletters/2025/12/_preview_13/original.jpg\" width=\"800\" /> \n(Illustration by Shawna X) \n<p><b>Watch. </b>Here are the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/2025/12/best-movies-2025-one-battle-after-another-weapons/685007/?utm_source=feed\">10 best movies of 2025</a>, according to our critic David Sims.</p><p><b>Explore. </b><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/2025/12/school-photos-expensive-parents/685059/?utm_source=feed\">What\u2019s the point of school photos anymore</a>?

    "abstract": "<p><img alt=\"biorxiv_logo_homepage7-5-small.png\" src=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/sites/default/files/images/biorxiv_logo_homepage7-5-small.png\" /></p>Group II introns are self-splicing ribozymes that are considered the ancestors of the eukaryotic spliceosome. Unlike canonical group II introns that self-splice to generate linear exons and lariats, circularly permuted (CP) group II introns identified in various bacterial phyla perform back-splicing, resulting in the production of circular RNAs and branched products via branching pathway. Furthermore, CP introns may switch to a hydrolysis pathway resulting in distinct products to differentially regulate gene expression. In this study, we present biochemical data and high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of a CP group II intron from Comamonas testosteroni KF-1 (Cte 1), allowing mechanistic dissection of the branching pathway switch to the hydrolysis pathway and enabling reconstruction of both both steps of the hydrolysis pathway. The structures reveal that CP undergoes the hydrolysis pathway upon mutations of the branch point or splice sites (SS) due to rearrangements in the active site. Here, the branching nucleotide in domain D6 is retracted from its catalytically competent conformation, giving way to the nucleophilic water molecule to attack the 5' splice site. Furthermore, we visualized the intermediates of the second splicing step, which reveal the movement of domain D6 out of the way for the 3'-splicing to occur, closely resembling the second-step structures of the branching pathway. Finally, our structures provide direct evidence for domains D1D2D3 acting as a scaffold in group II introns.Together, these findings visualize the complete hydrolysis pathway and offer a new strategy to engineer CP introns for circular RNA production, with potential applications in both basic research and therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "Previously, we showed that the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein explores a wide range of biophysical properties facilitated by non-local impact of point mutations to its intrinsically disordered regions (Nguyen et al., 2024). This includes modulation of self-association, such as the creation of a de novo binding interface through the P13L mutation characteristic of Omicron variants. In the present work, we focus on the key function of N condensing viral RNA into ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) for viral assembly. Lacking high-resolution structural information, biochemical and biophysical approaches have revealed architectural principles of RNPs, which involve cooperative interactions of several protein-protein and protein-RNA interfaces, initiated through oligomerization of conserved transient helices in the central disordered linker of N. Here, we study the impact of defining N-protein mutations in variants of concern on RNP formation, using biophysical tools, a virus-like particle assay, and reverse genetics experiments. We find convergent evolution in repeated, independent introduction of amino acid substitutions strengthening existing binding interfaces, compensating for other substitutions that promote viral replication but decrease RNP stability. Furthermore, we show that the P13L mutation of Omicron variants enhances RNP assembly and increases viral fitness. Overall, our data reveal RNP complexes to be highly variable not only in sequence and conformations but also in thermodynamic and kinetic stability, with its pleomorphism affecting basic architectural principles. We hypothesize that the formation of polydisperse, fuzzy N-RNA clusters with multiple distributed weak binding interfaces optimizes reversible RNA condensation, while supporting host adaptation and allowing for a large sequence space to be explored.",

Yet dispersal costs vary with origin, sex, and life-history traits, shaping the balance between gene flow and adaptation. We quantified these heterogeneous costs by comparing the reproductive success of local and immigrant individuals using a 15-year genetic pedigree of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), including over 1,100 adults and 3,400 juveniles. Immigrants represented 19.5% of adults, showed male-biased dispersal, and averaged 15% lower reproductive success than locals. However, outcomes were strongly origin-dependent: immigrants from some populations suffered severe fitness costs while others matched or exceeded locals. Sex and life-history further modulated reproductive success: male immigrants underperformed local males, whereas multi-sea-winter females often equaled or outperformed female residents. Immigrant males partially compensated their fitness offset by acquiring more mates. These findings highlight that, while local adaptation promotes philopatry, immigrants origin effects should be considered in gene-flow adaptation dynamics.",

First, a heat-transfer framework based on transient conduction and thermal diffusivity is developed to estimate stabilization times using dimensionless criteria. Then, extensive experimental tests on ATP containers validate these predictions and reveal additional phenomena such as air leakage and chimney effects. Based on these findings, a revised protocol is proposed that reduces the test duration from more than 18 h to approximately 2 h while preserving the thermal stabilization conditions required by ATP. Experimental results show that the uncertainty in the determination of the global heat-transfer coefficient K is reduced from about 2&amp;ndash;2.3% in the classical ATP procedure to roughly 0.7&amp;ndash;1.0% with the new protocol. In addition, the method suppresses secondary physical effects&amp;mdash;such as chimney-driven air leakage and latent-heat losses due to water evaporation&amp;mdash;thus improving the physical representativeness of the measured K value. The proposed accelerated protocol offers a scientifically grounded, cost-effective alternative for future ATP standards.</p>",

Though nucleosome-bound cfDNA harbors rich epigenomic features that could enable ctDNA identification by single-molecule multi-omics cross-validation, this remains unexplored due to methodological limits. Here, we developed a cfDNA sequencing approach integrating methylation, fragmentomics, and histone modifications at the single-molecule level; together with gene semantics and epigenomic annotations, these modalities were vectorized and fused to represent each cfDNA molecule. We trained a Transformer-based model (cfAI) to profile and evaluate ctDNA likelihood at molecule, gene, and sample levels. cfAI achieved ~10-fold enrichment of cancer-derived signals over noise and reached 72.6% sensitivity at 93.1% specificity for multi-cancer detection. Our study establishes an innovative framework that overcomes the inherent signal-to-noise limitations of conventional assays and reveals biological features at molecular resolution for cancer detection.",

However, its occurrence dynamics and lineage specificity across the tree of life have not yet been fully characterized. Utilizing the recently developed and improved Z-DNA searching tool, ZSeeker, we analyzed 281,139 complete organismal genomes, including multiple Telomere-to-Telomere genome assemblies, and generated genome-wide Z-nucleic acid maps, examined their topography, and compared them to dinucleotide-preserving controls. Cellular genomes featured pervasive Z-DNA enrichment relative to expectation, with enrichments of ~1.5 and ~1.7-fold in Bacteria and Archaea and ~3-fold in Eukaryota. In contrast, Viruses exhibited large differences between lineages, with modest enrichment in several DNA viral groups and pronounced depletion across RNA clades, most notably Influenza A/B strains. We built a LASSO regression model trained on non-Influenza viruses (cross-validated R2 {approx} 0.73), which identified GC content, genome type, and host type as the leading predictors for Z-nucleic acid density, yet it significantly over-predicted Z-RNA density in Influenza A/B. More than 99% of assemblies exceeded the +2 SD threshold, and a \"typical Influenza\" genome was predicted at 2.76 bp/kb compared to ~0.016 bp/kb observed (a ~170-fold overestimation based on chance alone). Together, these results reveal domain- and lineage-specific regimes: cellular genomes are enriched for Z-DNA consistent with regulatory roles, whereas influenza viruses appear to have undergone strong, lineage-specific depletion of Z-RNA-forming sequences, likely reflecting evolutionary pressure tied to host sensing pathways.",
