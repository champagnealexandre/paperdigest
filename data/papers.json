    "title": "Beta-coalescents when sample size is large",
    "summary": "Individual recruitment success, or the offspring number distribution of a given population, is a fundamental element in ecology and evolution. Sweepstakes reproduction refers to a highly skewed individual recruitment success without involving natural selection and may apply to individuals in broadcast spawning populations characterised by Type III survivorship. We consider an extension of the Schweinsberg (2003) model of sweepstakes reproduction for a haploid panmictic population of constant size N; the extension also works as an alternative to the Wright-Fisher model. Our model incorporates an upper bound on the random number of potential offspring (juveniles) produced by a given individual. Depending on how the bound behaves relative to the total population size, we obtain the Kingman (1982a,c,b) coalescent, an incomplete Beta-coalescent, or the (complete) Beta-coalescent of Schweinsberg (2003). We argue that applying such an upper bound is biologically reasonable. Moreover, we estimate the error of the coalescent approximation. The error estimates reveal that convergence can be slow, and small sample size can be sufficient to invalidate convergence, for example if the stated bound is of the form N/ log N. We use simulations to investigate the effect of increasing sample size on the site-frequency spectrum. When the limit is a Beta-coalescent, the site frequency spectrum will be as predicted by the limiting tree even though the full coalescent tree may deviate from the limiting one. When in the domain of attraction of the Kingman coalescent the effect of increasing sample size depends on the effective population size as has been noted in the case of the Wright-Fisher model. Conditioning on the population ancestry (the random ancestral relations of the entire population at all times) may have little effect on the site-frequency spectrum for the models considered here (as evidenced by simulation results).",

    "summary": "We describe a computational method, HPVarcall, that assigns DNA sequences of a human papillomavirus (HPV) variant of known type to lineages and sublineages. The algorithm relies on statistical models - positional frequency profiles - trained on multiple alignments of HPV genomic sequences that are known to belong to specific sublineages of a given HPV type. The workflow begins with multiple alignment of all available sequences for the HPV type, followed by construction of a phylogenetic tree and identification of branches containing sublineage-specific reference sequences. In the prediction phase, sublineage-specific statistical models are used to compute the posterior probabilities for each sublineage given a query sequence. The query classifies to belong to the sublineage with the highest posterior probability. Accuracy assessments performed for the nine HPV types included in the Gardasil 9 vaccine demonstrated a low error rate in assigning HPV genomic fragments of at least 1000 nucleotides to their correct sublineages and even higher accuracy for longer sequence fragments.",

    "summary": "Antibody developability is a critical consideration in therapeutic manufacturing, with conformational stability, measured by melting temperature (Tm), being a key determinant of manufacturability. Traditional experimental approaches to assess Tm are costly and low-throughput, while statistical models offer limited predictive power and generalizability. In this study, we present a scalable, sequence-only machine learning (ML) approach to predict the thermostability of antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) using embeddings from IgBERT, a protein language model fine-tuned on antibody sequences. We trained a Random Forest regressor on 133 proprietary antibody sequences with measured Fab Tm values, achieving a Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.77 on a held-out internal test set. When applied to a Jain set of clinical-stage therapeutics, the model retained predictive power (PCC = 0.28), outperforming baseline statistical and sequence-similarity methods. Embedding proximity in t-SNE space correlated with prediction accuracy, suggesting that model generalizability is influenced by distributional similarity rather than sequence identity. Our results demonstrate that PLM-derived embeddings encode biophysical features relevant to Fab thermostability and offer a fast, interpretable, and scalable route to de-risk antibody lead candidates.",

    "summary": "Testosterone is the most studied androgen in hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women. Many transgender men also receive long-term testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) and have high serum testosterone levels compared to the low levels seen in cisgender women. Compared to other sex hormones such as estrogen and progesterone, the effects of testosterone on the mammary gland have been relatively understudied and there is little data regarding the long term safety of this treatment. Comparison of mammary glands from transgender men on TRT and cisgender women can reveal the effects of testosterone treatment on mammary gland biology and provide critical information regarding the long-term effects of TRT on patient health and disease outcomes. In this study, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of breast tissues from a demographics-matched cohort of cisgender women and transgender men on TRT. Surprisingly, participants on TRT had unchanged serum levels of estradiol compared to controls. Among the observed transcriptional differences for participants on TRT were a dramatically reduced expression of genes downstream of estrogen signaling pathways in hormone receptor positive (HR+) luminal epithelial cells, as well as a decreased overall menstrual cycle-related hormone signaling. We confirmed this finding experimentally by showing reduced expression of progesterone receptor a/b, a prominent marker of estrogen signaling, in donors on TRT. Our results support the hypothesis that high levels of testosterone in transgender men on TRT suppress sex hormone signaling in the breast as seen on their impact on HR+ mammary epithelial cells, with implications for TRT as an antagonist of estrogen signaling and protection against breast cancer.",

    "summary": "Metal nanoparticles and their environment can be locally heated on an ultrafast timescale using femtosecond pulsed illumination of their plasmon resonance, making them of interest for spatiotemporal temperature control. Here, we propose experimental approaches to obtain time-resolved particle and medium temperatures using gold nanoparticles. 23.5 and 39 nm nanoparticles dispersed in water and DMF:water mixture were heated and probed using transient absorption spectroscopy. Simulations indicate that the change in absorbance >10 ps after excitation arises from temperature-induced alterations in the dielectric functions of the particle and the medium. Thus, we measured the temperature-dependent absorbance spectra of nanoparticles, where the signal reflects the combined response of the particle and the medium to heating for a known temperature. We then disentangled the spectra obtaining the particle (Method 1) and the medium contributions (Method 2) to heating independently, followed by a consistency check between the two approaches (Method 3). Accordingly, transient absorbance spectrum was resolved to extract particle and medium temperatures at each time delay. The resulting profiles are in line with each other, revealing temperature increases of ~80 K for the particle and 5-15 K for the medium when excited at 400 nm with ~4 J/m^2 fluence. A faster particle temperature decay was observed with decreasing particle size, and a faster medium temperature decay with increasing medium thermal diffusivity, in agreement with expectations. Overall, we demonstrate an experimental methodology for simultaneous determination of particle and medium temperatures under spatiotemporal gradient which is relevant for studies with transient heating and nanoparticles as sensors.",

    "summary": "Aqueous solubility is an important property for assessing the druggability and ecotoxicological effects of molecules. Successful drug candidates should have optimal aqueous solubility to improve bioavailability to target tissues. To effectively screen molecules in a short period of time, reliable predictive models are highly useful. In the present study, we conducted a round-robin exercise using a large, curated dataset of over 6000 compounds to predict aqueous solubility quantitatively. The six participating groups used an array of Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms to develop models with strong robustness and external predictive performance. All the models underwent rigorous Leave-One-Out and 10-fold cross-validation. The diversity of training sets and descriptor types used by different groups paved the way for exploring the mechanistic basis for the efficient identification of contributing features. The best-performing model was selected using the statistical Sum of Ranking Differences (SRD) approach, considering the performances on training, cross-validation, and test, as well as the performance difference between the training and test sets. Additionally, a curated, true external set was screened by the six different models. Here, the best-performing model was selected using a consensus ranking strategy based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R_Ext^2. In both approaches, i.e., the inherent model performance in terms of training, test, and cross-validation statistics, and the ability of the model to efficiently predict true external data, the Stacking Ensemble of Deep q-RASPR model emerged as the winner. This model showed comparable predictive performance to the previously reported model, which apparently lacked a proper data curation workflow and contained a significant number of duplicates and mixtures in its dataset, which can inflate model statistics. The insights from the different feature contributions from the different groups identified the useful structural and physicochemical aspects, which can help synthetic chemists to optimize molecules.",

    "summary": "Quality control of aberrant mRNAs is essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. Ribosome collisions caused by translational stalling trigger mRNA surveillance pathways that promote degradation of faulty transcripts. In yeast, two major collision-responsive pathways have been proposed: the Hel2-Cue2 pathway and the Syh1-Xrn1 pathway, yet their functional relationship and conservation in mammals have remained unclear. Here, we demonstrate that these two pathways act redundantly to degrade collision-inducing mRNAs in both yeast and mammalian cells. In yeast, we dissect the contribution of Cue2-mediated endonucleolytic cleavage and show that eS7 polyubiquitination-dependent cleavage plays a dominant role in Hel2-Cue2 pathway. In mammals, although the proposed Cue2 homolog N4BP2 is dispensable, we provide the first direct evidence of collision-induced endonucleolytic mRNA cleavage. Together, our findings reveal both conserved and divergent features of ribosome collision-coupled mRNA quality control and expand our understanding of mRNA surveillance and potential therapeutic mRNA implications.",

    "title": "The evolution of socially modulated dispersal",
    "summary": "Dispersal plays a key role in ecology and evolutionary biology, including as a mechanism that reduces local competition. However, dispersers often suffer a fitness disadvantage relative to nondispersers, which may lead individuals to prefer that others disperse rather than dispersing themselves. Hence, if individuals can force their neighbours to disperse, they may be favoured to do so rather than voluntarily dispersing for the good of others. Besides forcing dispersal, individuals might also improve their neighbours' ability to disperse. Here, we investigate the evolutionary drivers and consequences of socially modulated dispersal. We find that: (1) there are three possible stable evolutionary outcomes, involving only voluntary dispersal, only socially modulated dispersal, or coexistence of the two; (2) although social modulation that does not improve dispersal success can only be favoured if it is less costly than dispersal itself, social modulation that facilitates dispersal can be favoured even if it is highly expensive for the facilitator; (3) facilitated dispersal may, counterintuitively, lead to a reduced overall level of dispersal; and (4) social modulation can be either welcome or unwelcome from the perspective of the disperser. These predictions emphasise that the evolution of dispersal depends on individuals' abilities to both disperse and modulate.",

Additionally, we close two gaps left open in a previous classification of self-dual $CR$ codes with covering radius $\\rho\\leq 3$: we precisely determine over which finite fields the $MDS$ self-dual completely regular codes with parameters $[2,1,2]_q$ and $[4,2,3]_q$ exist.",

    "title": "A Uniform Pilot and Data Payload Optimization Framework for OTFS-Based ISAC",
    "summary": "arXiv:2512.24624v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) signal is considered a promising solution for high-mobility wireless environments. It manages Doppler effects by utilizing delay-Doppler (DD) domain processing. However, the relatively long OTFS frame duration could introduce considerable sensing or communication latency when radar and communication are performed separately. By operating in a dual-functional radar and communication (DFRC) mode, the OTFS system performs sensing and data transmission simultaneously, thereby reducing the resulting latency. Nevertheless, the optimal OTFS DFRC signal strategy remains insufficiently explored. This paper investigates the optimal signal design for OTFS DFRC systems, focusing on pilot symbol design and data symbol power allocation. Specifically, we derive a channel capacity lower bound metric for communication that considers channel estimation errors in OTFS. For sensing, we derive an integrated sidelobe level (ISL), accounting for the randomness of the data symbols alongside the deterministic pilot symbols. Leveraging the above metrics, we formulate an optimization problem that balances radar and communication performance, and then solve it using an alternating optimization framework. We validate the proposed signal through numerical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations. Our analysis shows that OTFS DFRC enforces a deterministic pilot signal that is characterized by a concentrated peak in the DD domain, which furnishes a common structure in the DD domain facilitating sensing and channel estimation, with data multiplexed in other DD grids, thereby unifying sensing and communication within a single OTFS signal. Compared with conventional OTFS signals, the proposed OTFS DFRC signal expands the achievable sensing-communication performance region, delivering at least a 9.45 dB ISL suppression for sensing and a 4.82 dB SINR ratio gain for communication.",

    "title": "Throughput Optimization in UAV-Mounted RIS under Jittering and Imperfect CSI via DRL",
    "summary": "arXiv:2512.24773v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can reshape wireless propagation on-demand. However, their performance is sensitive to UAV jitter and cascaded channel uncertainty. This paper investigates a downlink multiple-input single-output UAV-mounted RIS system in which a ground multiple-antenna base station (BS) serves multiple single-antenna users under practical impairments. Our goal is to maximize the expected throughput under stochastic three-dimensional UAV jitter and imperfect cascaded channel state information (CSI) based only on the available channel estimates. This leads to a stochastic nonconvex optimization problem subject to a BS transmit power constraint and strict unit-modulus constraints on all RIS elements. To address this problem, we design a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework with a contextual bandit formulation. A differentiable feasibility layer is utilized to map continuous actions to feasible solutions, while the reward is a Monte Carlo estimate of the expected throughput. We instantiate this framework with constrained variants of deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) that do not use target networks. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms yield higher throughput than conventional alternating optimization-based weighted minimum mean-square error (AO-WMMSE) baselines under severe jitter and low CSI quality. Across different scenarios, the proposed methods achieve performance that is either comparable to or slightly below the AO-WMMSE benchmark, based on sample average approximation (SAA) with a relative gap ranging from 0-12%. Moreover, the proposed DRL controllers achieve online inference times of 0.6 ms per decision versus roughly 370-550 ms for AO-WMMSE solvers.",

    "title": "The Generalization Error of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms",
    "summary": "arXiv:2411.12030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: In this paper, the method of gaps, a technique for deriving closed-form expressions in terms of information measures for the generalization error of supervised machine learning algorithms is introduced. The method relies on the notion of \\emph{gaps}, which characterize the variation of the expected empirical risk (when either the model or dataset is kept fixed) with respect to changes in the probability measure on the varying parameter (either the dataset or the model, respectively). This distinction results in two classes of gaps: Algorithm-driven gaps (fixed dataset) and data-driven gaps (fixed model). In general, the method relies on two central observations: $(i)$~The generalization error is the expectation of an algorithm-driven gap or a data-driven gap. In the first case, the expectation is with respect to a measure on the datasets; and in the second case, with respect to a measure on the models. $(ii)$~Both, algorithm-driven gaps and data-driven gaps exhibit closed-form expressions in terms of relative entropies. In particular, algorithm-driven gaps involve a Gibbs probability measure on the set of models, which represents a supervised Gibbs algorithm. Alternatively, data-driven gaps involve a worst-case data-generating (WCDG) probability measure on the set of data points, which is also a Gibbs probability measure. Interestingly, such Gibbs measures, which are exogenous to the analysis of generalization, place both the supervised Gibbs algorithm and the WCDG probability measure as natural references for the analysis of supervised learning algorithms. All existing exact expressions for the generalization error of supervised machine learning algorithms can be obtained with the proposed method. Also, this method allows obtaining numerous new exact expressions, which allows establishing connections with other areas in statistics.",

While classical information theory focuses on transmission and storage limits, it lacks a unified physical framework to quantify the thermodynamic costs of generating information from compressed laws versus retrieving it from memory. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that treats information processing as an enabling mapping from ontological states to carrier states. We introduce a novel metric, Derivation Entropy, which quantifies the effective work required to compute a target state from a given logical depth. By analyzing the interplay between Shannon entropy (storage) and computational complexity (time/energy), we demonstrate the existence of a critical phase transition point. Below this threshold, memory retrieval is thermodynamically favorable; above it, generative computation becomes the optimal strategy. This \"Energy-Time-Space\" conservation law provides a physical explanation for the efficiency of generative models and offers a rigorous mathematical bound for designing next-generation, energy-efficient AI architectures. Our findings suggest that the minimization of Derivation Entropy is a governing principle for the evolution of both biological and artificial intelligence.",

While at each level it is possible to consider the problem locally as an allocation of an agent to its children, the multilevel allocation can be seen as a trace capturing the fact that the process is iterated until the leaves of the tree. In principle, each intermediary node may have its own local allocation mechanism. The main challenge is then to design algorithms which can retain good fairness and efficiency properties. In this paper we propose two original algorithms under the assumption that leaves of the tree have matroid-rank utility functions and the utility of any internal node is the sum of the utilities of its children. The first one is a generic polynomial-time sequential algorithm that comes with theoretical guarantees in terms of efficiency and fairness. It operates in a top-down fashion -- as commonly observed in real-world applications -- and is compatible with various local algorithms. The second one extends the recently proposed General Yankee Swap to the multilevel setting. This extension comes with efficiency guarantees only, but we show that it preserves excellent fairness properties in practice.",

This paper develops a contact-geometric formulation of dissipative field theories, extending the least constraint theorem to complex fields and establishing a link between contact geometry and probability measures. By applying this framework to the 2D CGLE, we derive the dissipative Contact Hamilton-Jacobi (CHJ) equation, which governs the evolution of the action functional. Through canonical transformation and travelling-wave reduction, exact solutions of the CHJ equation are obtained. From a probabilistic perspective, we derive the probability density functional of the 2D CGLE, identify a universal switching line that separates different dynamical regimes, and reveal a first-order periodon--soliton phase transition with a hysteresis loop. The conserved contact potential is identified as the key geometric quantity governing pattern formation in dissipative media, playing a role analogous to energy in conservative systems. This contact-geometric framework provides a unified analytical tool for studying pattern selection and state transitions.",

Here, we investigate the fracture patterns that emerge when a localized surface-tension perturbation is applied to a sumi film supported on a water-glycerol subphase. Sumi is a traditional Japanese carbon black ink, and this process, referred to as sumi-wari, produces aesthetically pleasing, star-shaped crack patterns with multiple spikes radiating from the perturbation site. The number of crack spikes increases with the viscosity of the subphase, controlled here by the addition of glycerol. Atomic force microscopy measurements reveal that the effective stiffness of the sumi f ilm decreases as glycerol concentration increases. This suggests a strong coupling between the subphase properties and the mechanics of the sumi film. To capture the dynamics of sumi-wari, a phenomenological model is outlined, based on an overdamped equation of motion for particles connected by breakable springs. Numerical simulations reproduce both the morphology and the experimental trends of sumi-wari: the number of cracks and their temporal evolution depend on the spring stiffness, mirroring the behavior observed for subphases with different viscosities. These findings demonstrate how the interplay between surface-tension gradients, subphase properties, and film mechanics governs local fracture and pattern formation in fluid-supported thin films",

    "summary": "arXiv:2512.24538v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Current understanding suggests that as the Sun brightens in the far future, Earth's carbonate-silicate cycle will offset increasing temperatures by drawing CO$_2$ out of the atmosphere, ultimately leading to the extinction of all terrestrial plant life via either overheating or CO$_2$ starvation. Most previous estimates put the future lifespan of Earth's terrestrial biosphere at $\\sim$1 billion yr, but recent work used a new coupled climate-continental weathering model with up-to-date parameter constraints to revise this estimate upward to 1.6-1.86 billion yr. In this study, we extend the model to examine the impacts of seafloor weathering and stochastic variations in CO$_2$ outgassing rates on the remaining lifespan of Earth's terrestrial biosphere. We find that if seafloor weathering has a stronger feedback than continental weathering and accounts for a large portion of global silicate weathering, then the remaining lifespan of the terrestrial biosphere can be shortened, but a lifespan of more than 1 billion yr (Gyr) remains likely. Similarly, stochastic fluctuations in outgassing rates can have a significant impact if the size of the fluctuations exceed those observed over the last 1 billion yr. The impact of weak seafloor weathering and lower variability stochasticity are minor. Our work provisionally supports a lengthened lifespan of Earth's terrestrial biosphere, suggests robustness of this lengthened lifespan to planetary parameters that may vary among exoplanets, and identifies seafloor weathering as a key process that requires further study and constraint.",

    "title": "EMPEROR I. Exoplanet MCMC parallel tempering for RV orbit retrieval",
    "summary": "arXiv:2511.05331v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: We present EMPEROR, an open-source Python framework designed for efficient exoplanet detection and characterisation with radial velocities (RV). EMPEROR integrates Dynamic Nested Sampling (DNS) and Adaptive Parallel Tempering (APT) Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), supporting multiple noise models such as Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Moving Averages (MA). The framework enables systematic model comparison using statistical metrics, including Bayesian evidence ($\\ln{\\mathcal{Z}}$) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), while providing automated, publish-ready visualisations. EMPEROR is evaluated across three distinct systems to assess its capabilities in different detection scenarios. Sampling performance, model selection, and the search for Earth-mass planets are evaluated in data for 51 Pegasi, HD 55693 and Barnard's Star (GJ 699). For 51 Pegasi, APT achieves an effective sampling increase over DNS by a factor 3.76, while retrieving tighter parameter estimates. For HD 55693 the stellar rotation $P_{\\text{rot}}=29.72^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$ and magnetic cycle $P_{\\text{mag}}=2557.0^{+70.1}_{-36.7}$ are recovered, while demonstrating the sensitivity of $\\ln{\\mathcal{Z}}$ to prior selection. For Barnard's star, several noise models are compared, and the confirmed planet parameters are successfully retrieved with all of them. The best model shows a period of 3.1536$\\pm$0.0003~d, minimum mass of 0.38$\\pm$0.03 M$_{\\rm{\\oplus}}$, and semi-major axis of 0.02315$\\pm$0.00039~AU. Purely statistical inference might be insufficient on its own for robust exoplanet detection. Effective methodologies must integrate domain knowledge, heuristic criteria, and multi-faceted model comparisons. The versatility of EMPEROR in handling diverse noise structures, its systematic model selection, and its improved performance make it a valuable tool for RV exoplanetary studies.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2503.19681v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Network remodeling, or adaptation, in the presence of periodically driven forcings has hereto remained largely unexplored, despite the fact that a broad class of biological transport networks, e.g. animal vasculature, depends on periodic driving (pulsatility of the heart) to maintain flow. Short-term pulsatile dynamics of compliant vessels affects the long-term structures of adapting networks; however, what the correct adaptation rule is for pulsatile flows still remains an open question. Here we propose a new adaptation rule for periodically driven complex elastic networks that accounts for the effect of short-term pulsatile dynamics on the remodeling signal at long time-scales. Using this rule to adapt hierarchical elastic networks with multiple levels of looping, we show that very different network architectures are possible at steady-state depending on the driving frequency of the pulsatile source and the geometric asymmetry of the paths between the externally driven nodes of the network. Specifically resonant frequencies are shown to prioritize the stabilization of fully looped structures or higher level loops proximal to the source, whereas anti-resonant frequencies predominantly stabilize loop-less structures or lower-level loops distal to the source. Thus, this model offers a mechanism that can explain the stabilization of phenotypically diverse loopy network architectures in response to source pulsatility under physiologically relevant conditions and in the absence of other known loop stabilization mechanisms, such as random fluctuations in the load or perfusion homogenization.",

While statistical mechanics successfully captures the temporal averages of local observables, understanding randomness at the level of higher statistical moments remains a daunting challenge, with analytic progress largely confined to random quantum circuit models or fine-tuned systems exhibiting space-time duality. Here we study how much randomness can be dynamically generated by generic quantum-chaotic evolution under physical, non-random Hamiltonians. Combining theoretical insights with numerical simulations, we show that for broad classes of initially unentangled states, the dynamics become effectively Haar-random well before the system can ergodically explore the physically accessible Hilbert space. Both local and highly nonlocal observables, including entanglement measures, equilibrate to their Haar expectation values and fluctuations on polynomial timescales with remarkably high numerical precision, and with the fastest randomization occurring in regions of parameter space previously identified as maximally chaotic. Interestingly, this effective randomization can occur on timescales linear in system size, suggesting that the sub-ballistic growth of Renyi entropies typically observed in systems with conservation laws can be bypassed in non-random Hamiltonians with an appropriate choice of initial conditions.",

Using the recently developed fuzzy sphere regularization, we directly extract the scaling dimensions of low-lying operators via the state-operator correspondence. At the critical point, we demonstrate conformal multiplet structure together with the hallmark of emergent spacetime supersymmetry through characteristic relations between fermionic and bosonic operators. Moreover, by tuning the Yukawa coupling, we explicitly track the evolution of operator spectra from the decoupled Ising-Majorana fixed point to the interacting superconformal fixed point, revealing renormalization-group flow at the operator level.

This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.",

    "title": "Assessment of First-Principles Methods in Modeling the Melting Properties of Water",
    "summary": "arXiv:2512.23940v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: First-principles simulations have played a crucial role in deepening our understanding of the thermodynamic properties of water, and machine learning potentials (MLPs) trained on these first-principles data widen the range of accessible properties. However, the capabilities of different first-principles methods are not yet fully understood due to the lack of systematic benchmarks, the underestimation of the uncertainties introduced by MLPs, and the neglect of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). Here, we systematically assess first-principles methods by calculating key melting properties using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) driven by Deep Potential (DP) models trained on data from density functional theory (DFT) with SCAN, revPBE0-D3, SCAN0 and revPBE-D3 functionals, as well as from the MB-pol potential. We find that MB-pol is in qualitatively good agreement with the experiment in all properties tested, whereas the four DFT functionals incorrectly predict that NQEs increase the melting temperature. SCAN and SCAN0 slightly underestimate the density change between water and ice upon melting, but revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 severely underestimate it. Moreover, SCAN and SCAN0 correctly predict that the maximum liquid density occurs at a temperature higher than the melting point, while revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 predict the opposite behavior. Our results highlight limitations in widely used first-principles methods and call for a reassessment of their predictive power in aqueous systems.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2509.25332v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Stellar multiplicity plays a crucial role in shaping planet formation and dynamical evolution. We present a survey of 54 TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) within 300 pc that exhibit significant Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric accelerations. We identified 35 TOIs with stellar companions at projected separations between $0.1^{\\prime\\prime}$ to $2^{\\prime\\prime}$ (or $10-200$ AU). We also identified 12 TOIs that could host planetary-mass or brown dwarf companions, including 6 that are newly discovered. Furthermore, we perform three-dimensional orbital characterization for 12 binaries hosting confirmed planets or planet candidates, allowing us to constrain the line-of-sight mutual inclination, $\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{los}}$, between the planetary and binary orbits. Combining our sample with previous measurements, we apply Bayesian hierarchical analysis to a total of 26 binary systems with S-type transiting planets ($r_p<5R_{\\oplus}$). Specifically, we fit the $\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{los}}$ distribution with both single (Rayleigh) and mixture models (two-component Rayleigh and Rayleigh-isotropic mixture). We find the mixture models are strongly favored ($\\log Z\\gtrsim13.9$, or $\\approx$5$\\sigma$), indicating the observed planet-binary $\\Delta I_{\\mathrm{los}}$ values likely originate from two underlying populations: one nearly aligned ($\\sigma_1 = 2^{\\circ}.4^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$) and one with more scattered mutual inclinations ($\\sigma_2 = 23^{\\circ}.6^{+8.8}_{-7.1}$). Alternatively, the misaligned systems can be equally well described by an isotropic distribution of inclinations. This observed dichotomy likely reflects different dynamical histories. Notably, the misaligned population only emerges in systems with stellar periastron distances $>40$ AU while systems with close-in or eccentric stellar companions (periastron distances $<40$ AU) preserve planet-binary alignment.",

The system under consideration involves the Caputo fractional derivative of order $0<\\alpha\\leq 1$, a closed linear operator generating a strongly continuous semigroup, and instantaneous state jumps governed by bounded linear impulse operators. We first derive an explicit representation of the mild solution by combining fractional solution operators with impulsive operators. Using this representation, we characterize the approximate controllability of the system through a necessary and sufficient condition expressed in terms of the convergence of an associated family of impulsive resolvent operators. This resolvent condition extends the classical criterion for approximate controllability to the fractional impulsive setting. To illustrate the applicability of our theoretical results, a concrete example is provided. The analysis presented here bridges the gap between the well-established theory for integer-order impulsive systems and the more complex fractional case, highlighting the distinct challenges and solutions arising from the interplay of fractional dynamics and impulsive effects.",

The formulation is based on the Onsager-Machlup variational principle, and it allows us to find reduced dynamical equations by minimizing information discrepancy with respect to the detailed evolution. The reduced evolution consists of a Hamiltonian vector field and a gradient flow. The reduction method is illustrated on the Kac-Zwanzig model, where we show how irreversibility emerges from purely Hamiltonian evolution by ignoring some degrees of freedom. We also show how to generalize the Fisher information matrix and Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probability distributions to the case when the two distributions are related by the principle of maximum entropy, even in the case when the entropy is not of Boltzmann-Gibbs type (for instance Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat entropy).",

Many active systems exhibit circular swimming, ubiquitous in chemical, physical, and biological systems, that biases motion and reduces transport efficiency. We show that stochastic position-orientation resetting can overcome these limitations in two-dimensional chiral active Brownian particles by interrupting circular motion, resulting in tunable dynamics. When resets are infrequent compared to chiral rotation, the steady-state mean-squared displacement varies non-monotonically with rotational diffusion. Steady state excess kurtosis and orientation autocorrelation yields spatiotemporal state diagram comprising three states: an activity-dominated chiral state, and two resetting-dominated states with and without chiral rotation; in contrast, the achiral(or non-chiral) counterpart supports only the resetting-dominated state without chiral rotation. Chirality thus enriches the dynamical landscape, enabling tunable transitions between transport modes absent in achiral systems. A simple reset protocol can therefore transform chiral active dynamics and offer a practical strategy for optimizing search and transport in circle swimmers.",

To validate the vulnerability of DNN-based MDE models, this study proposes a projection-based adversarial attack method that projects perturbation light onto a target object. The proposed method employs physics-in-the-loop (PITL) optimization -- evaluating candidate solutions in actual environments to account for device specifications and disturbances -- and utilizes a distributed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. Experiments confirmed that the proposed method successfully created adversarial examples that lead to depth misestimations, resulting in parts of objects disappearing from the target scene.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2512.11459v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2512.23945v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Real-world Constrained Multi-objective Optimization Problems (CMOPs) often contain multiple constraints, and understanding and utilizing the coupling between these constraints is crucial for solving CMOPs. However, existing Constrained Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (CMOEAs) typically ignore these couplings and treat all constraints as a single aggregate, which lacks interpretability regarding the specific geometric roles of constraints. To address this limitation, we first analyze how different constraints interact and show that the final Constrained Pareto Front (CPF) depends not only on the Pareto fronts of individual constraints but also on the boundaries of infeasible regions. This insight implies that CMOPs with different coupling types must be solved from different search directions. Accordingly, we propose a novel algorithm named Decoupling Constraint from Two Directions (DCF2D). This method periodically detects constraint couplings and spawns an auxiliary population for each relevant constraint with an appropriate search direction. Extensive experiments on seven challenging CMOP benchmark suites and on a collection of real-world CMOPs demonstrate that DCF2D outperforms five state-of-the-art CMOEAs, including existing decoupling-based methods.",

    "title": "Generalising E-prop to Deep Networks",
    "summary": "arXiv:2512.24506v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recurrent networks are typically trained with backpropagation through time (BPTT). However, BPTT requires storing the history of all states in the network and then replaying them sequentially backwards in time. This computation appears extremely implausible for the brain to implement. Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) proposes an mathematically equivalent alternative where gradient information is propagated forwards in time locally alongside the regular forward pass, however it has significantly greater computational complexity than BPTT which renders it impractical for large networks. E-prop proposes an approximation of RTRL which reduces its complexity to the level of BPTT while maintaining a purely online forward update which can be implemented by an eligibility trace at each synapse. However, works on RTRL and E-prop ubiquitously investigate learning in a single layer with recurrent dynamics. However, learning in the brain spans multiple layers and consists of both hierarchal dynamics in depth as well as time. In this mathematical note, we extend the E-prop framework to handle arbitrarily deep networks, deriving a novel recursion relationship across depth which extends the eligibility traces of E-prop to deeper layers. Our results thus demonstrate an online learning algorithm can perform accurate credit assignment across both time and depth simultaneously, allowing the training of deep recurrent networks without backpropagation through time.",

This representation manifold is exponentially large in system size and is reachable through simple local dynamics, despite constituting a subdominant subset of the global configuration space. We further show that learning can be implemented directly on this structure via a fully local, gradient-free mechanism that selectively stabilizes a single task-relevant network configuration. Unlike error-driven or contrastive learning schemes, this approach does not require explicit comparisons between network states obtained with and without output supervision. Instead, transient supervisory signals bias the dynamics toward the representation manifold, after which local plasticity consolidates the attained configuration, effectively shaping the latent representation space. Numerical evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks indicate performance comparable to that of multilayer perceptrons trained using backpropagation. More generally, these results suggest that the dynamical accessibility of fixed points and the stabilization of internal network dynamics constitute viable alternative principles for learning in recurrent systems, with conceptual links to statistical physics and potential implications for biologically motivated and neuromorphic computing architectures.",

We introduce GRASP - GRouped Activation Shared Parameterization - a lightweight PEFT framework that partitions the D-dimensional token representations of selected layers into K << D groups and learns a shared scaling and shifting vector for each group. This grouped modulation reduces the number of trainable parameters significantly while preserving the ability of the model to learn task-specific features. Building on this formulation, we further propose StochGRASP, which learns Gaussian distributions as perturbations to the pre-trained weights rather than deterministic values. This probabilistic parameterization along with a noise-aware loss function formulation enables modelling hardware-level variability in programmed weights and significantly improves robustness under non-ideal inference conditions-an important requirement for deployment on edge-based emerging AI hardware. Across GLUE (RoBERTa-base & RoBERTa-large) and E2E NLG (GPT-2 Medium), GRASP matches or exceeds the performance of established PEFT methods while achieving an order of magnitude reduction in trainable parameters compared to LoRA and BitFit. Under varying levels of noise, StochGRASP consistently outperforms deterministic variants, demonstrating its suitability for energy-efficient and noise-prone hardware platforms.",

We review basic aspects of the canonical formulation, symplectic geometry, Liouville integrability, and Lax Pairs. We define the Hamiltonian formulation of the Chern-Simons action and the canonical generators of the gauge symmetries, which are surface integrals that subject to non-trivial boundary conditions, realize transformations that do change the physical state, namely large (or improper gauge transformations). We propose asymptotic conditions that realize an infinite set of abelian conserved charges associated with integral models. We review two different cases: the Korteweg-de Vries equation for its connection with the Virasoro algebra and fluid dynamics, and the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) hierarchy, as it embeds an infinite class of non-linear notable integrable evolution equations. We propose a concrete example for gravity in 3D with $\\Lambda<0$, where we find a near-horizon asymptotic dynamics. We finalize offering some insights on the initial value problem, its connection with integrable systems and flat connections. We study some properties of the Monodromy matrix and recover the infinite KdV charges from the trace invariants extracted from the Monodromy evolution equation that can be written in a Lax form.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2512.22327v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The ceiling of the Buttery in All Souls College, Oxford, designed by the English Baroque architect Nicholas Hawksmoor, has a vaulted form on an oval base. It is coffered with an array of approximately square sunken lacunaria, whose sizes and positions vary so as to accommodate the constraints of the curved surface and its boundaries. A similar design appears in the dome of the Roman Pantheon. Using methods of differential geometry, we hypothesise that these cofferings should be the images under conformal mappings of regular square tilings of a rectangle or finite cylinder. This guarantees that the coffer ribs meet exactly at right angles and the coffers are close to being square. These mappings are simply the inverse of Mercator's projection of the curved surface onto a plane. For a ceiling which is a general surface of revolution, we derive formulae for the dimensions and location of each coffer. Our results, taking into account camera distortion, are in excellent agreement with photographs of the Hawksmoor ceiling and the Pantheon dome, as well as with recent direct measurements of the latter. We also describe a protocol by which Hawksmoor's ceiling might have been constructed without advanced mathematics.",

The formulation is based on the Onsager-Machlup variational principle, and it allows us to find reduced dynamical equations by minimizing information discrepancy with respect to the detailed evolution. The reduced evolution consists of a Hamiltonian vector field and a gradient flow. The reduction method is illustrated on the Kac-Zwanzig model, where we show how irreversibility emerges from purely Hamiltonian evolution by ignoring some degrees of freedom. We also show how to generalize the Fisher information matrix and Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probability distributions to the case when the two distributions are related by the principle of maximum entropy, even in the case when the entropy is not of Boltzmann-Gibbs type (for instance Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat entropy).",

    "title": "Constraints on the perfect phylogeny mixture model and their effect on reducing degeneracy",
    "summary": "arXiv:2512.24930v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The perfect phylogeny mixture (PPM) model is useful due to its simplicity and applicability in scenarios where mutations can be assumed to accumulate monotonically over time. It is the underlying model in many tools that have been used, for example, to infer phylogenetic trees for tumor evolution and reconstruction. Unfortunately, the PPM model gives rise to substantial ambiguity -- in that many different phylogenetic trees can explain the same observed data -- even in the idealized setting where data are observed perfectly, i.e. fully and without noise. This ambiguity has been studied in this perfect setting by Pradhan et al. 2018, which proposed a procedure to bound the number of solutions given a fixed instance of observation data. Beyond this, studies have been primarily empirical. Recent work (Myers et al. 2019) proposed adding extra constraints to the PPM model to tackle ambiguity. In this paper, we first show that the extra constraints of Myers et al. 2019, called longitudinal constraints (LC), often fail to reduce the number of distinct trees that explain the observations. We then propose novel alternative constraints to limit solution ambiguity and study their impact when the data are observed perfectly. Unlike the analysis in Pradhan et al. 2018, our theoretical results regarding both the inefficacy of the LC and the extent to which our new constrains reduce ambiguity are not tied to a single observation instance. Rather, our theorems hold over large ensembles of possible inference problems. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study degeneracy in the PPM model in this ensemble-based theoretical framework.",

This current is induced and tuned by an explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonian that includes a Zeeman term arising from the interaction between the spin system and circularly polarized light. To capture the effect, we apply a first-order perturbation method to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, using a breathing Skyrmion ansatz based on the Belavin-Polyakov profile. This approach reveals that the time-dependent deformation of the Skyrmion boundary produces an anisotropic breathing mode, which in turn generates a nonzero Skyrmion number current. The resulting dynamics in momentum space form a limit cycle, whose characteristics depend on the external magnetic field amplitude, the Heisenberg exchange coupling, and the Gilbert damping constant. Our formulation not only clarifies the topological origin of optically driven Skyrmion motion but also points to Skyrmion number currents as a low-dissipation alternative to electric currents for efficient Skyrmion control.",

This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2512.25007v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In the study of alternative or extended theories of gravity, Dirac's Hamiltonian constraint algorithm is invaluable for enumerating the propagating modes and gauge symmetries. For gravity, this canonical approach is frequently applied as a means for finding pathologies such as strongly coupled modes; more generally it facilitates the reconstruction of gauge symmetries and the quantization of gauge theories. For gravity, however, the algorithm can become notoriously arduous to implement. We present a simple computer algebra package for efficiently computing Poisson brackets and reconstructing constraint algebras. The tools are stress-tested against pure general relativity and modified gravity, including the order reduction of general relativity at two loops.",

Slightly deleterious mutations are acquired along the lineages at a constant rate, and individuals carrying less mutations have a selective advantage. In the classical variant, an individual's selective advantage is proportional to the difference between the population average and the individual's mutation load, whereas in the ratchet with {\\em tournament selection} only the signs of the differences of the individual mutation loads matter. In a parameter regime which leads to slow clicking (i.e. to a loss of the currently fittest class at a rate $\\ll 1/N$) we prove that the rescaled process of click times of the tournament ratchet converges as $N\\to \\infty$ to a Poisson process. Central ingredients in the proof are a thorough analysis of the metastable behaviour of a two-type Moran model with selection and deleterious mutation (which describes the size of the fittest class up to its extinction time) and a lower estimate on the size of the new fittest class at a clicktime.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2512.24446v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Chaotic dynamical systems exhibit strong sensitivity to initial conditions and often contain unresolved multiscale processes, making deterministic forecasting fundamentally limited. Generative models offer an appealing alternative by learning distributions over plausible system evolutions; yet, most existing approaches focus on next-step conditional prediction rather than the structure of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we reframe forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows and obtaining forecasts through marginalization. This new perspective allows the model to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies, represent multistep trajectory segments, and produce next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. We also introduce a general, model-agnostic training and inference framework for joint generative forecasting and show how it enables assessment of forecast robustness and reliability using three complementary uncertainty quantification metrics (ensemble variance, short-horizon autocorrelation, and cumulative Wasserstein drift), without access to ground truth. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two canonical chaotic dynamical systems, the Lorenz-63 system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and show that joint generative models yield improved short-term predictive skill, preserve attractor geometry, and achieve substantially more accurate long-range statistical behaviour than conventional conditional next-step models.",

We use this property and explicit integration of Lagrange interpolation formulas for the time-dependent Hamiltonian within each time interval and derive approximations that preserve unitarity for the differential time evolution operators of general time-dependent Hamiltonians. The resulting second-order approximation is the same as using the average of Hamiltonians for two end points of time. We identify three fourth-order approximations involving commutators of Hamiltonians at different times and also derive a sixth-order expression. A test of these approximations along with other available expressions for a two-state time-dependent Hamiltonian with sinusoidal time dependences provides information on the relative performance of these approximations and suggests that the derived expressions can serve as useful numerical tools for time evolution in time-resolved spectroscopy, quantum control, quantum sensing, real-time ab initio quantum dynamics, and open system quantum dynamics.",

Unfortunately, how these data-driven models perform computations is largely unknown and whether their internal representations are interpretable or physically consistent is an open question. Here, we adapt tools from interpretability research in Large Language Models to analyze intermediate computational layers in GraphCast, leveraging sparse autoencoders to discover interpretable features in the neuron space of the model. We uncover distinct features on a wide range of length and time scales that correspond to tropical cyclones, atmospheric rivers, diurnal and seasonal behavior, large-scale precipitation patterns, specific geographical coding, and sea-ice extent, among others. We further demonstrate how the precise abstraction of these features can be probed via interventions on the prediction steps of the model. As a case study, we sparsely modify a feature corresponding to tropical cyclones in GraphCast and observe interpretable and physically consistent modifications to evolving hurricanes. Such methods offer a window into the black-box behavior of data-driven physics models and are a step towards realizing their potential as trustworthy predictors and scientifically valuable tools for discovery.",

However, the capabilities of different first-principles methods are not yet fully understood due to the lack of systematic benchmarks, the underestimation of the uncertainties introduced by MLPs, and the neglect of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). Here, we systematically assess first-principles methods by calculating key melting properties using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) driven by Deep Potential (DP) models trained on data from density functional theory (DFT) with SCAN, revPBE0-D3, SCAN0 and revPBE-D3 functionals, as well as from the MB-pol potential. We find that MB-pol is in qualitatively good agreement with the experiment in all properties tested, whereas the four DFT functionals incorrectly predict that NQEs increase the melting temperature. SCAN and SCAN0 slightly underestimate the density change between water and ice upon melting, but revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 severely underestimate it. Moreover, SCAN and SCAN0 correctly predict that the maximum liquid density occurs at a temperature higher than the melting point, while revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 predict the opposite behavior. Our results highlight limitations in widely used first-principles methods and call for a reassessment of their predictive power in aqueous systems.",

However, the CG approaches have long been limited by the difficulty of constructing both accurate and transferable models efficiently, considering the large diversity of chemical structures of materials. Among CG force fields, Martini is the most widely used, as it retains essential chemical features while offering substantial computational efficiency. Its most recent version, Martini 3, expands chemical resolution through a much broader bead set, particularly for small molecules. However, this flexibility also complicates the mapping of organic molecules because of context-dependent rules and the lack of standardized procedures. To address this issue, we present an automated framework that builds Martini 3 models directly from SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings by combining a curated bead dictionary with a hierarchical, rule-based algorithm. Our framework, Martini Mapper, generated Martini 3 models for more than 5,000 molecules across four chemically diverse datasets. A curated subset of 1,081 mapped structures was benchmarked through octanol-water free-energy ($\\Delta G_{OW}$) and partition-coefficient ($\\log P$) calculations, yielding strong agreement with experimental values. The workflow can also map large molecules containing up to 126 heavy atoms, exceeding the capabilities of existing automated approaches. The algorithm and the complete set of more than 5,000 mapped itp/top files are available at the \\href{https://github.com/eliobaby/Martini_mapping}{Martini Mapper}. Our framework, therefore, enables systematic and scalable Martini 3 structures for high-throughput simulations relevant to drug discovery and materials design.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2512.24543v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Defects trap photocarriers and hinder solar water splitting. The nanoscale photocarrier transport, trapping, and recombination mechanisms are usually inferred from ensemble-averaged measurements and remain elusive. Because an individual high-performing nanoparticle photocatalyst may outperform the ensemble average, design rules that would otherwise enhance catalytic efficiency remain unclear. Here, we introduce photomodulated electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in an optically coupled scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to map photocarrier localization. Using rhodium-doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3:Rh) solar water-splitting nanoparticles, we directly image the carrier densities concentrated at oxygen-vacancy surface trap states. This is achieved by separating photothermal heating from photocarrier populations through experimental and computational analyses of low-loss spectra. Photomodulated STEM-EELS enables angstrom-scale imaging of defect-induced photocarrier traps and their impact on photocatalytic efficiency.",

Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we studied premelting layers at the basal face of ice in contact with styrene-butadiene rubber from 254 to 269 K. Despite its hydrophobicity, rubber enhances structural disorder of interfacial water, promoting premelting. In contrast, water mobility is suppressed by confinement from polymer chains, leading to glassy dynamics distinct from the ice-vapor interface. Near the melting point, rubber chains become more flexible and penetrate the premelting layer, forming a mixed rubber-water region that couples the dynamics of both components. These results suggest that nanoscale roughness and morphology of hydrophobic polymers disrupt ice hydrogen-bond networks, thereby enhancing premelting. Our findings provide molecular-level insight into ice slipperiness and inform the design of polymer materials with controlled ice adhesion and friction.",

Experimentally, an isotope effect on $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ is observed: the melting temperature of H$_2$O is approximately 4~K lower than that of D$_2$O. This difference can only be explained by nuclear quantum effects (NQEs), which can be accurately captured using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD). Here we run PIMD simulations driven by Deep Potential (DP) models trained on data from density functional theory (DFT) based on SCAN, revPBE0-D3, SCAN0, and revPBE-D3 and a DP model trained on the MB-pol potential. We calculate the \\tm of ice, the density discontinuity at melting, and the temperature of density maximum ($T_{\\mathrm{dm}}$) of the liquid. We find that the model based on MB-pol agrees well with experiment. The models based on DFT incorrectly predict that NQEs lower $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$. For the density discontinuity, SCAN and SCAN0 predict values close to the experimental result, while revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 significantly underestimate it. Additionally, the models based on SCAN and SCAN0 correctly predict that the $T_{\\mathrm{dm}}$ is higher than $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$, while those based on revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 predict the opposite. We attribute the deviations of the DFT-based models from experiment to the overestimation of hydrogen bond strength. Our results set the stage for more accurate simulations of aqueous systems grounded on DFT.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2512.24256v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Tritium adsorption on surfaces creates a variety of issues, ranging from the fields of fusion applications to small and large-scale laboratory experiments using tritium. The extent to which tritium accumulates on surfaces is generally material-dependent and must be determined through experiments. Additionally, this surface contamination necessitates the implementation of appropriate decontamination procedures, preferably in-situ. A suitable method could be exposure to ozone during UV irradiation. However, it is currently not known if both components are necessary for the decontamination. At Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe, both questions on contamination and decontamination can be addressed using a single experimental setup. With this, it is possible to expose solid samples to gaseous tritium to measure the temporal activity evolution. Furthermore, the system can be filled with dry air, and dry air containing ozone to explore their decontamination effect. Both measurement modes were applied to beryllium and tungsten samples, which were chosen for their relevance in fusion. The beryllium surface was observed to accumulate tritium more than four times faster than tungsten when exposed to gaseous tritium. Concerning the decontamination, without simultaneous UV irradiation, exposure to ozone did not have any distinct effect on the surface activity compared to simply using dry air. This leads to the conclusion that UV illumination of the surfaces is required to achieve a significant decontamination factor.",

These ingredients define an \"information volume\" for each observational cell.\n  By incorporating the logarithm of this volume as an additional constraint in a minimum-relative-entropy inference scheme, temperature, chemical potential, and pressure arise as conjugate variables of a single information-theoretic functional. This leads to a Legendre-type structure and a first-law-like relation in which pressure corresponds to information volume rather than geometric volume.\n  For nonequilibrium dynamics, entropy production is characterized through the relative-entropy asymmetry between forward and time-reversed stochastic evolutions. A decomposition using observational entropy then separates total dissipation into system and environment contributions. Heat is defined as the part of dissipation not accounted for by the system-entropy change, yielding a representation that does not rely on local detailed balance or a specific bath model. We further show that the difference between joint and partially observed dissipation equals the average of conditional relative entropies, providing a unified interpretation of hidden dissipation and information-flow terms as projection-induced gaps.",

However, the study of excitons in more complex chemical systems and solid materials over the past two decades has made it clear that simple concepts based on Wannier or Frenkel excitons are not sufficient to describe detailed excitonic behavior, especially in nano-structured solid materials, multichromophoric macromolecules, and complex molecular aggregates. In addition, important effects such as vibronic coupling, the influence of charge-transfer (CT) components, spin-state interconversion, and electronic correlation, which had long been studied but not fully understood, have turned out to play a central role in many systems. This has motivated new experimental approaches and theoretical studies of increasing sophistication. This article provides an overview of works addressing these issues that were published for A Special Topic of the Journal of Chemical Physics on \"Excitons: Energetics and spatio-temporal dynamics\" and discusses their implications.",

We use this property and explicit integration of Lagrange interpolation formulas for the time-dependent Hamiltonian within each time interval and derive approximations that preserve unitarity for the differential time evolution operators of general time-dependent Hamiltonians. The resulting second-order approximation is the same as using the average of Hamiltonians for two end points of time. We identify three fourth-order approximations involving commutators of Hamiltonians at different times and also derive a sixth-order expression. A test of these approximations along with other available expressions for a two-state time-dependent Hamiltonian with sinusoidal time dependences provides information on the relative performance of these approximations and suggests that the derived expressions can serve as useful numerical tools for time evolution in time-resolved spectroscopy, quantum control, quantum sensing, real-time ab initio quantum dynamics, and open system quantum dynamics.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2309.10695v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Near infrared (NIR, 700 - 1,000 nm) and short-wave infrared (SWIR, 1,000 - 2,000 nm) dye molecules exhibit significant nonradiative decay rates from the first singlet excited state to the ground state. While these trends can be empirically explained by a simple energy gap law, detailed mechanisms of the nearly universal behavior have remained unsettled for many cases. Theoretical and experimental results for two representative NIR/SWIR dye molecules reported here clarify the key mechanism for the observed energy gap law behavior. It is shown that the first derivative nonadiabatic coupling terms serve as major coupling pathways for nonadiabatic decay processes from the first excited singlet state to the ground state for these NIR and SWIR dye molecules and that vibrational modes other than the highest frequency ones also make significant contributions to the rate. This assessment is corroborated by further theoretical comparison with possible alternative mechanisms of intersystem crossing to triplet states and also by comparison with experimental data for deuterated molecules.",

Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we studied premelting layers at the basal face of ice in contact with styrene-butadiene rubber from 254 to 269 K. Despite its hydrophobicity, rubber enhances structural disorder of interfacial water, promoting premelting. In contrast, water mobility is suppressed by confinement from polymer chains, leading to glassy dynamics distinct from the ice-vapor interface. Near the melting point, rubber chains become more flexible and penetrate the premelting layer, forming a mixed rubber-water region that couples the dynamics of both components. These results suggest that nanoscale roughness and morphology of hydrophobic polymers disrupt ice hydrogen-bond networks, thereby enhancing premelting. Our findings provide molecular-level insight into ice slipperiness and inform the design of polymer materials with controlled ice adhesion and friction.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2511.11859v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Coarse-graining (CG) reduces molecular details to extend the time and length scales of molecular dynamics simulations to microseconds and micrometers. However, the CG approaches have long been limited by the difficulty of constructing both accurate and transferable models efficiently, considering the large diversity of chemical structures of materials. Among CG force fields, Martini is the most widely used, as it retains essential chemical features while offering substantial computational efficiency. Its most recent version, Martini 3, expands chemical resolution through a much broader bead set, particularly for small molecules. However, this flexibility also complicates the mapping of organic molecules because of context-dependent rules and the lack of standardized procedures. To address this issue, we present an automated framework that builds Martini 3 models directly from SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings by combining a curated bead dictionary with a hierarchical, rule-based algorithm. Our framework, Martini Mapper, generated Martini 3 models for more than 5,000 molecules across four chemically diverse datasets. A curated subset of 1,081 mapped structures was benchmarked through octanol-water free-energy ($\\Delta G_{OW}$) and partition-coefficient ($\\log P$) calculations, yielding strong agreement with experimental values. The workflow can also map large molecules containing up to 126 heavy atoms, exceeding the capabilities of existing automated approaches. The algorithm and the complete set of more than 5,000 mapped itp/top files are available at the \\href{https://github.com/eliobaby/Martini_mapping}{Martini Mapper}. Our framework, therefore, enables systematic and scalable Martini 3 structures for high-throughput simulations relevant to drug discovery and materials design.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2512.24175v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Seed dispersal is a fundamental process that allows offspring to reach suitable habitats and colonize new environments. While most plants rely on external vectors, some have evolved mechanisms that employ the buildup of liquid pressure in a closed compartment and its explosive release to disperse their seeds. This form of energy storage, reinvented by humans for engineering applications, is termed a hydraulic accumulator. Here we investigated the fluid mechanics involved in dispersal in the squirting cucumber, Ecballium elaterium integrating high-speed videography (up to 10 000 fps), microtomography, and internal pressure sensors. We recorded long-term pressure time series showing that E. elaterium exhibits circadian (24 hour) and ultradian (short-period) rhythms. Remarkably, the measurements revealed a lack of correlation between fruit and stem turgor; while the stem showed strong circadian cycles, the fruit often did not, suggesting isolated physiological processes in different tissues. The fruit's spongy wall tissue stores elastic potential energy as turgor pressure builds to nearly one atmosphere (92-99 kPa). Upon detachment, this energy is rapidly released to expel a turbulent, particle-laden liquid jet. Microtomography revealed that the seeds are packed around a central funiculus, a configuration that optimizes their exit through the basal orifice at velocities of up to 30 m/s. Seeds eventually move faster than the liquid droplets during the later stages of ejection as they shed their liquid coating. This sophisticated mechanism ensures a broad dispersal cone, effectively spreading offspring across space and environmental conditions.",

Here, we introduce a highly coarse-grained model of actin filaments that preserves helicity and chirality while enabling mesoscale simulations. The framework is implemented in Cytosim, an open-source cytoskeleton simulation platform. We can predict and finely control the shape and mechanical properties of this helical filament, that can be matched to experimental values. Using this model, we investigated the role of filament chirality in motor-driven dynamics. We first show that in two different experimental configurations, motor movement along a helical filament results in a chiral motion of the filament. In a bundle of helical filaments, dimeric motors exert torques on each filament, inducing collective behaviors in the bundle such as rotation, coiling, and helical buckling, reminiscent of those observed in filopodia. Together, these results demonstrate the central role of helicity and chirality in actin mechanics and motor-driven dynamics, and establish our framework as a powerful tool for mesoscale simulations. This framework can also be used for other helical filaments beyond actin.",

This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2512.24427v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We develop an extended Dynamical Mean Field Theory framework to analyze gene regulatory networks (GRNs) incorporating epigenetic modifications. Building on the Hopfield network model analogy to spin glass systems, our approach introduces dynamic terms representing DNA methylation and histone modification to capture their regulatory influence on gene expression. The resulting formulation reduces high-dimensional GRN dynamics to effective stochastic equations, enabling the characterization of both stable and oscillatory states in epigenetically regulated systems. This framework provides a tractable and quantitative method for linking gene regulatory dynamics with epigenetic control, offering new theoretical insights into developmental processes and cell fate decisions.",

    "title": "Hierarchical Loop Stabilization in Periodically Driven Elastic Networks",
    "summary": "arXiv:2503.19681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Network remodeling, or adaptation, in the presence of periodically driven forcings has hereto remained largely unexplored, despite the fact that a broad class of biological transport networks, e.g. animal vasculature, depends on periodic driving (pulsatility of the heart) to maintain flow. Short-term pulsatile dynamics of compliant vessels affects the long-term structures of adapting networks; however, what the correct adaptation rule is for pulsatile flows still remains an open question. Here we propose a new adaptation rule for periodically driven complex elastic networks that accounts for the effect of short-term pulsatile dynamics on the remodeling signal at long time-scales. Using this rule to adapt hierarchical elastic networks with multiple levels of looping, we show that very different network architectures are possible at steady-state depending on the driving frequency of the pulsatile source and the geometric asymmetry of the paths between the externally driven nodes of the network. Specifically resonant frequencies are shown to prioritize the stabilization of fully looped structures or higher level loops proximal to the source, whereas anti-resonant frequencies predominantly stabilize loop-less structures or lower-level loops distal to the source. Thus, this model offers a mechanism that can explain the stabilization of phenotypically diverse loopy network architectures in response to source pulsatility under physiologically relevant conditions and in the absence of other known loop stabilization mechanisms, such as random fluctuations in the load or perfusion homogenization.",
