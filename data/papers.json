    "title": "Decoupled Representation Learning Improves Generalization in CRISPR Off-Target Prediction",
    "summary": "Computational prediction of CRISPR-Cas9 off-target activity is a critical step toward the safe and scalable design of guide RNAs. Most existing deep learning models are trained on large proxy datasets derived from high-throughput assays; however, their performance often degrades when evaluated on experimentally validated off-target sites. This limitation raises concerns about the generalization ability of proxy-trained models and highlights the need for architectures that better transfer to biologically relevant benchmarks such as TrueOT. We propose a two-stage deep learning framework that decouples sequence representation learning from off-target classification. In the first stage, guide RNA sequences are encoded using pretrained transformer-based embeddings learned from large genomic corpora. In the second stage, a hybrid neural network integrates these embeddings with mismatch-level and sequence-pair features to predict off-target activity. Models are trained exclusively on a proxy dataset and evaluated under strict external validation on the TrueOT benchmark. Our results show that incorporating pretrained sequence embeddings substantially improves generalization performance. The full two-stage model achieves consistent improvements in ROC-AUC and PR-AUC on TrueOT, relative to proxy-only baselines, across repeated runs. We demonstrate a consistent generalization effect under distribution shift, robust to training noise, seeds, and evaluation variance. These findings provide empirical evidence that representation transfer plays a critical role in bridging the gap between proxy assay data and experimentally validated off-target behavior.",

    "title": "The Influence of Ligands on AlphaFold3 Prediction of Cryptic Pockets",
    "summary": "Cryptic pockets are binding sites that are formed or exposed upon a conformational change. They represent an important class of potentially druggable binding sites. Reliably predicting cryptic pockets capable of binding ligands, however, remains a challenge. Herein we examine the use of AlphaFold 3 (AF3) for generating realistic conformational ensembles that include known cryptic pockets. We find that AF3 is generally able to reproduce the scale of conformational change required for cryptic site formation. When given a cryptic-site ligand for the protein, AF3 predominantly predicts conformations competent to bind the ligand in the cryptic site; without the ligand, conformations lacking the cryptic pocket generally dominate. While the results may reflect a bias toward memorized structural priors, the level of detrimental memorization appears to be limited. We also show that the choice of the ligand can significantly impact the predictions, and that AF3 is able to produce models with the ligand correctly positioned. Variability in ligand position, however, suggests that generating ensembles of co-folded predictions is critical to enhancing the likelihood of obtaining a correct binding mode. Overall, AF3-generated protein-ligand structural ensembles have potential utility in cryptic-site drug discovery, and they can reveal ligands likely to bind to those sites.",

    "summary": "Network medicine leverages large biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) to model disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic opportunities. However, most deep learning approaches that use KGs in biomedicine remain task-specific, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse applications within a unified framework. Here, we introduce NetMedGPT, a transformer-based foundation model trained on a large-scale biomedical KG using masked token prediction. By learning contextualized representations of biomedical nodes, NetMedGPT enables unified, zero-shot inference across different drug discovery tasks. Specifically, in five tasks, i.e., predicting the association of drugs with indications, targets, adverse drug reactions, contraindications, and off-label uses, NetMedGPT consistently outperforms all specialized baselines, achieving area under the precision-recall curve gains of between 2.2% and 26%. When evaluated on independent external datasets, NetMedGPT outperformed baseline on an expert-curated clinical indications set and also preferentially prioritized clinically relevant drug-disease pairs in ClinicalTrials.gov. NetMedGPT's generative capability further supports the construction of mechanistically plausible subnetworks offering biological insights. NetMedGPT provides a unified foundation model for network medicine that supports scalable hypothesis generation and provides potential to accelerate drug repurposing. We further provided an interactive interface (https://prototypes.cosy.bio/chatnetmedgpt/) that allows users to obtain model inferences through natural-language queries.",

    "summary": "Evolutionary pressure on microbial communities propagating under extreme environmental conditions often results in unique structural adaptations to promote cell survival. Here, we report an investigation of AbpX, a biomatrix protein identified in cultures of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrodictium abyssi. Under ex vivo and in vitro conditions, AbpX assembles into a para-crystalline lattice composed of semiflexible fibrils. CryoEM analysis of recombinant AbpX fibrils reveals that the precursor protein polymerizes through donor strand complementation (DSC), a process previously reported for chaperone-usher fimbriae in Gram-negative bacteria. Unlike the latter DSC protein polymers, AbpX undergoes chaperone-free polymerization in the presence of calcium ions, which are sequestered at the donor strand-acceptor groove interface between protomers in the fibril. Using a combination of cryoEM and crystallographic structural information, an atomic model is proposed for the AbpX lattice that provides insight into its potential role in biofilm formation. These findings suggest that calcium ion coordination triggers fibril assembly and pre-organizes the fibrils for incorporation into the protein lattice. Bioinformatic analysis indicates that AbpX exemplifies a distinct and broadly distributed clade of calcium ion responsive biomatrix proteins within the TasA superfamily that can be fabricated into hydrogel biomaterials in vitro under environmentally benign conditions.",

    "title": "Polymer Concentration Induced Self-assembly of Block Copolymers in Ionic Liquid Smart Inks",
    "summary": "Assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) with epoxy is useful to enhance the mechanical toughness of 3D-printable epoxy inks. Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) like 1-Ethyl-3-Methylimidazolium dicyanamide ([EMIM][DCA]) have enhanced the self-assembly of pure BCP, enabling the formation of a controlled nanostructure. However, the mechanistic details of the morphological transitions of BCP to nanostructures in the presence of ILs remain unresolved. Here, we developed a coarse-grained (CG) model for a certain class of BCPs, namely Pluronic P123 in [EMIM][DCA] ionic liquid, to investigate the underlying mechanism beyond nanostructure transition of BCPs under varying temperature and composition. At various Pluronic compositions (20-60 wt%), P123 self-aggregates into spherical, cylindrical, and lamellar nanostructures, confirmed by visual inspection and quantitative metrics. An increase in the concentration of Pluronic leads to the formation of a more favorable self-interaction, resulting in a more ordered, lamellar-shaped aggregate. We suggest that morphological changes of nanostructure are governed by the balance between entropic and enthalpic factors. In a higher ordered shape (lamellar phase), enthalpic dominates, while in spherical-shaped micelles, both entropic and enthalpic are equivalent. Our CG model of PEO and PPO beads can be used to investigate the BCPs phase separation and will further help to understand the thermodynamics of self-aggregation for other BCPs in IL medium. This study will guide the acceleration of the discovery process for advanced 3D printable materials, including Pluronic P123 or other Pluronic materials.",

Incorporation into PCL films transforms the rapid, minute-scale NO release of the powders into sustained release profiles lasting up to 24 h in biologically relevant media. By selecting the type of porous solid and tuning its loading and particle size within the polymer matrix, the NO dosage and release rate can be modulated. The film-like form of these PCL/porous material composites is particularly promising for clinical applications, such as wound dressings, where controlled NO release may support healing while providing antibacterial effects.",

    "summary": "All solid-state batteries (ASSBs) based on solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are a novel Li-ion battery technology with the potential of enhanced safety, longer lifetimes, and increased energy density when coupled with the Li-metal anode. Li-Argyrodite (Li6PS5Cl) is a promising SSE with high ionic conductivity, produced using cheap and sustainable precursors, and therefore of interest to both academia and industry. Like many other sulfide-based SSEs, it is however unstable against Li-metal. Using ab-initio and machine-learning methods, we simulate three representative Li-metal/Li-Argyrodite interface models to investigate whether the exact surface termination affects the chemical stability and ion transport capability. We present a systematic approach to create low-energy interfaces by screening 28 low Miller-index surface terminations of Li-argyrodite and coupling them with Li-metal. Custom-made machine-learned interatomic potentials trained on ab-initio data enable the simulation of large interface models with over 2000 atoms for 5 ns. We find that all three interfaces decompose into an amorphous solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, consisting of Li3P, Li2S and LiCl, which then crystallizes into an antifluorite phase Li2S{1-x-y}P{x}Cl{y}; {x,y = 0.14-0.15}. A two orders of magnitude decrease in Li-ion flux shows that the crystalline SEI layer is a sluggish ion conductor, similar to Li2S. While all three interfaces form the same crystalline SEI layer, the exact rates of the decomposition and crystallisation depend on the actual surface composition. These atomic-level insights could potentially be used to control the SEI formation in sulphide-based SSEs and others.",

    "title": "Enhancing Interfacial Properties in Aramid Fiber/Epoxy Composites via Hyperbranched Polyimide for Superior Performance",
    "summary": "Aramid fiber (AF) reinforced epoxy resin (EP) composites are widely regarded as promising candidates for fabricating advanced composites. However, the inherently weak interfacial adhesion between AF and EP considerably restricts the overall performance of AF/EP composites. Therefore, the effective interfacial optimization of is crucial for realizing high-performance AF/EP composites. In this work, an amino-terminated hyperbranched polyimide (HBPI) was synthesized via low-temperature solution polycondensation and utilized as a novel AF sizing agent. Thereafter, the AF/EP interfacial interactions were enhanced through the combined effects of chemical bonding between the HBPI sizing agent and EP and physical interactions (hydrogen bonding and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions) between HBPI sizing agent and AF, thereby benefiting stress transfer at the interfacial region. As a result, the 90\u00b0 tensile strength and NOL-ring interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of AF0.04/EP composites (with a 0.04 wt% HBPI sizing concentration) were improved by 38.45% and 14.31%, respectively, compared with the AFunsized/EP specimen. Furthermore, the tensile strength and elongation at break of the impregnated filament increased by 17.86% and 14.73%, respectively. These findings demonstrate that the HBPI sizing agent offers significant potential for enhancing the interfacial performance of AF/EP composites, providing valuable theoretical insights for the development of high-performance composite materials.",

A constant rGO loading (2 wt.%) was introduced via in situ hydrazine reduction of graphene oxide in the presence of TiO2. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated under Xe-lamp irradiation in two model reactions probing oxidative and reductive pathways: phenol degradation and H2 evolution using formic acid as a scavenger. rGO systematically enhanced phenol degradation for all morphologies, with bipy+rGO showing the highest activity. In contrast, H2 evolution was consistently suppressed upon rGO incorporation across all TiO2 samples, although the bipyramidal morphology remained the most active within each series.\nThese results highlight that facet exposure and surface functionalization dictate the beneficial or detrimental role of rGO depending on the targeted photocatalytic pathway.",

Herein, we report an operando Raman characterization that provides high voltage, time, and spatial resolutions, which enables simultaneous analysis of interfacial decomposition mechanism and morphological evolution. Using Na3SbS4 electrolyte (NSS) and its carboxymethyl-cellulose-encapsulated analogue (NSS-CMC) as exemplars, we precisely contrasted the subtle differences in the two-step reduction mechanism of the two electrolytes. In both systems, Na3SbS3 formed as an intermediate, and Na3Sb binary as one major final product; while the CMC coating altered the kinetics of Na3SbS3 formation and consumption, and extended the formation potential of Na3Sb from 1.35 V (seen in NSS) to 0.50 V (vs. Na/Na+). Oxidation of NSS and NSS-CMC both occur near 2.20 V, although CMC coating altered the crystallinity of the oxidative products. Simultaneously, we captured phenomena that are unique to solid-state electrochemical systems such as particle relocation, morphological change, and reversed reactions. We inferred CMC\u2019s dual role as a voltage barrier and a mechanical buffer in suppressing the electro-chemo-mechanical decomposition of NSS electrolyte.

This study investigates the structural, dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties of pure KNN and multi-element doped compositions: (K0.4Na0.48Bi0.1La0.02)(Nb0.9Ti0.1)O3 (KNN-BiLaTi) and (K0.4Na0.56La0.02Y0.02)(Nb0.9V0.05Sb0.05)O3 (KNN-LaYVSb), synthesized via conventional solid-state methods. Structural analysis (XRD/Rietveld) revealed single-phase orthorhombic perovskite structures (space group Amm2) for all samples, with no detectable secondary phases. XPS, Raman, SEM, and TEM revealed that the dopants tune defect chemistry, suppress surface alkali degradation, and refine the microstructure, especially in dense, low-porosity KNN-LaYVSb, which has pronounced lattice distortion for favorable domain wall motion. Dielectric experiments demonstrated lower orthorhombic\u2013tetragonal transition temperatures and wider, more diffuse phase transitions. However, Curie temperatures remained high, indicating reliable operation over a wide range of temperatures. At optimal poling, KNN-LaYVSb attained the highest piezoelectric coefficient (d\u2083\u2083 = 221 pC/N) and excellent thermal stability up to 275 \u00b0C, retaining over 90% of room-temperature value and over 80% at elevated temperatures near 450 \u00b0C. The improved temperature stability arises from diffuse phase transitions, defect-dipole stabilization, and nanoscale heterogeneity due to multi-element doping. The remnant polarization increased from 3.49 \u00b5C/cm\u00b2 (Pure-KNN) to 25.3 \u00b5C/cm\u00b2 (KNN-LaYVSb) with significantly reduced coercive field (6.10 kV/cm). These findings illustrate that selective multi-element co-doping at A- and B-sites effectively modifies polymorphic phase boundaries near room temperature by improving defect chemistry through controlled vacancy formation and optimizing microstructure. This results in robust, high-performance lead-free piezoceramics for advanced energy harvesting and sensing applications operating across wide temperature ranges.",

    "summary": "Nitrogen heterocycles are integral part of pharmaceuticals, catalysts, and materials, yet most accessible molecular scaffolds remain flat, aromatic rings with limited three-dimensionality. As medicinal chemistry increasingly seeks non-planar, sp3-rich architectures to improve molecular performance and to expand underexplored chemical space, methods that can remodel existing heterocycles into new 3D frameworks are urgently needed. Here we introduce a fundamentally new strategy for ring insertion that uses simple nucleophilic reagents - most notably, Grignard reagents - to introduce one-carbon  into azolium rings. This unprecedented nucleophilic rearrangement converts planar triazolium salts, derived from alkenes, into a previously inaccessible family of saturated, three-dimensional 1,2,4-triazinanes. The method is operationally simple, broadly applicable to cyclic, acyclic, natural, and highly functionalized alkenes, and remarkably tolerant of sensitive groups including esters, amides, sulfonamides, acetals, phosphates, and alkynes. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory computations reveal a unique nitrenium-centered pathway that enables this umpolung reactivity. By transforming readily available olefins into complex, non-planar nitrogen heterocycles in just two steps, this work provides a powerful entry into new heterocyclic space and opens opportunities for late-stage diversification relevant to drug discovery, catalysis, and molecular design.",

    "title": "Minding the Band gap: Major Factors for Correlating Computations with Experiments in Cu14 and Au20 Atomically Precise Nanoclusters",
    "summary": "In a Perspective article titled \"Mind the Gap!\", Bredas clarifies the distinction between different uses of the term  \"band gap\" in the context of experimentally measured or computationally evaluated energy gaps. In view of the tremendous progress in atomically precise metal nanoclusters where electrochemical and optical energetics are routinely supported by computations to establish structure-function correlations, we explore the relationship between different protocols for measuring and computing band gaps of two distinct organic ligand-protected nanoclusters: [Cu14H10(MBN)3(PPh3)8]+ and Au20(TBBT)16. Through UV/visible spectroscopy and differential pulse voltammetry, we measure optical and electrochemical band gaps in those systems. We then compare these experimental gaps to HOMO-LUMO gaps, fundamental gaps, vertical excitation energies, and Eox - Ered potentials computed using density functional theory (DFT) or time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT). We test functionals with varying degrees of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange from 0% to 50%, different correlation functionals, basis sets, and (equilibrium and non-equilibrium) continuum solvation models. We find that in both copper and gold nanoclusters, the most important factor affecting the magnitude of the band gap is the % HF exchange, which in the case of the HOMO-LUMO gap can vary by several eV. This sensitivity is partially mitigated when computing the fundamental, optical, and electrochemical gaps. The second most important factor is the proper description of solvation effects. Other factors, such as the nature of the correlation functional, basis set, and geometry relaxation, have a considerably smaller effect on computed band gaps in these systems. Overall, this work provides generalizable guidelines on factors at varied importance for correlating computed and experimental \"band gap\" values.",

The selectivity of this process depends strongly on the nature of substituents in hydrazine. Aryl hydrazines bearing electron-rich and electron-neutral aromatic groups form six-membered rings by attacking the cyclopropane via the NH group, while the NH2 group reacts in hydrazines equipped with electron-withdrawing aromatic substituents, \tacyl hydrazines, and carbazates. In both scenarios, the initial products of nucleophilic ring opening undergo in situ Lewis acid-induced cyclization, providing important azaheterocyclic systems in a single synthetic step; further transformations enable access to other valuable products. The proposed mechanism of the title process and the observed chemoselectivity switch have been explained by both experimental and computational studies.",

    "title": "Non-covalent inter-chain interactions dictate single chain encapsulation behavior of pnictogen chalcogenides within van der Waals nanotubes",
    "summary": "A fully developed understanding of the chemistry that governs interactions in low-dimensional materials is essential to realizing control over their structure, nanoscale morphology, and distinct physical properties. Yet, precisely achieving this in extended solids comprised of highly polarizable main group elements has remained a grand challenge especially in one-dimensional materials that approach the atomic scale. This is owing to the propensity of these heavy main group elements to drive the unusual localization or delocalization behavior of electrons in the system and the formation of competing metastable polytypes due to lone pair effects. In this report, we establish the composition-dependent encapsulation behavior of single chains derived from the low-dimensional Pn2Ch3 pnictogen chalcogenide class (Pn = Sb, Bi; Ch = S, Se, Te) and their strong dependence on the strength of inter-chain non-covalent interactions. Using Sb2S3 and Bi2S3 as model phases, we find that the degree of pnictogen (Pn) bonding is a significant factor in dictating the packing of the constituent quasi-1D chains in the bulk and their growth behavior as single chains upon encapsulation within single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Specifically, chains with weaker inter-chain interactions like Sb2S3 preferentially crystallize under slow-cooled growth parameters that resemble more thermodynamically preferred conditions while chains with stronger inter-chain interactions like Bi2S3 prefer to crystallize and isolate as bulk and only form the elusive encapsulated clustered and crystalline chain domains under rapidly quenched conditions. Systematic Sb/Bi alloying of the precursors revealed the pnictogen-dependence of the chain crystallization where Sb-rich alloys tend to more preferentially crystallize within SWCNTs. In these alloys, Bi preferentially occupies the peripheral three-coordinate site to maximize inter-chain interactions in the bulk, while Sb preferentially occupies the same site when encapsulated within SWCNT and devoid of chains adjacent to it. These results demonstrate that non-covalent bonding concepts in molecular main group systems track in low-dimensional solids that approach the atomic regime when encapsulated within nanotubes, marking a significant step forward in the rational and predictable encapsulation of all-inorganic chains within confined spaces.",

    "summary": "In this review we present eMap 2.0, a web-based application for predicting electron/hole transfer pathways in proteins and protein families based on their structures. The underlying model can be viewed as a coarse-grained version of the Pathways approach by Beratan and Onuchic [Beratan et al. J. Chem. Phys. 1987, 86, 4488]. Similar to the original framework, eMap employs graph-theory algorithms to search for the most efficient electron transfer pathways as shortest paths on a graph representation of the protein. What distinguishes eMap from the original formulation is that the nodes represent electron transfer active sites instead of atoms and only through-space tunneling is considered for each individual electron/hole hop. eMap 2.0 takes one step further by aiming at identifying shared electron transfer pathways in protein sets. From a graph theory standpoint, this is achieved using frequent subgraph mining (FSM) algorithms. Lastly, eMap 2.0 utilizes sequence and structural similarity measures to analyze and cluster the results. Here, we show how this robust method can be utilized to rapidly provide insights regarding conserved electron transfer pathways within protein families and to identify outliers in protein families, in which the conserved electron transfer pathway is blocked either by a mutation or conformational changes.",

    "title": "Length vs Velocity Gauge Formulation of the Frequency-Dependent Polarizability for 1D Periodic Systems at Coupled Cluster with Single and Double Excitations Level",
    "summary": "This work presents the implementation of the linear response function for 1D periodic systems at coupled cluster with single and double excitations with periodic boundary conditions level (LR-CCSD-PBC) for the calculation of the frequency-dependent electric dipole-electric dipole polarizability tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}(\\omega)$, with the modified velocity gauge (MVG) formalism. We compare this approach with the length gauge (LG) formalism that we presented in a previous work [APL Comp. Phys. 1, 026107 (2025)] in terms of theoretical analysis and computational results. Calculations on molecular systems with large Dunning basis sets including diffuse functions show a smooth convergence towards the complete basis set limit (CBS) with both formalisms, but LG and MVG converge to different values when CCSD provides an incomplete treatment of electron correlation. With the  small basis sets used in the PBC calculations, the difference between the gauge formalisms increases due to basis set incompleteness. For the PBC calculations on 1D periodic systems, the MVG formalism shows a faster convergence towards the thermodynamic limit with $k$ sampling compared to LG. Furthermore, the MVG formalism provides perfect agreement between PBC and long molecular cluster models. This is not the case for LG due to the so-called missing integer issue. However, a comparison with the molecular data suggests that the LG-PBC results with the small basis set affordable in this work are closer to the CBS results than those with MVG. This work represents a further step forward for the simulation of optical response properties for solid-state materials with systematically improvable quantum mechanical methods.",

    "summary": "The study of artwork is an interesting field that has undergone a major turn the last decades as new scientific analysis methods have been introduced and is becoming a significant part of the investigations. In this study we have employed Raman spectroscopy to analyse the pigments in an old painting of the Roman Emperor Domitian. The painting is of special interest since its creation is historically attributed to Tiziano Vecellio, more known as Titian, but it has recently been found to contain a signature that reads L daVinci. We here perform a rigorous pigment analysis of the painting and signature area to identify and classify the pigments by usage and the potential time of deployment. Microscopic cut outs from selected areas of the painting were analysed in a Raman microscope where 14 different pigments were identified. Out of these, 12 pigments were contemporary with Titian (1488/90-1567) and Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), one pigment, titanium white, was present during the Middle Ages but came into common use at a later time and one pigment, Prussian blue, is of newer origin. Complimentary X-ray imaging shows that at least one of the areas where Prussian blue was found has likely been altered at a later stage, providing an explanation for the presence of a modern pigment in an old painting. Special emphasis was also applied to resonant and non-resonant Raman response of Prussian green and blue, expressing different ratios of Fe2+ and Fe3+ states, valuable for identification and discrimination of the compounds in pigment identification and in the more recent field of battery research.",

    "summary": "Electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO\u2083RR \u2192 NH\u2083) suffers from poor selectivity and strong competition from hydrogen evolution. Here we show that materials-intrinsic electrostatic reprogramming of colloidal copper nitride (Cu\u2083N) nanocrystals provides a robust lever to bias NO\u2083RR. Two routes are established in a single electrolyte (0.50 M KNO\u2083 + 0.10 M KOH): (i) dilute Na incorporation that preserves the anti-ReO\u2083 (Pm-3m) lattice with small peak shifts, and (ii) Li treatment that amorphizes Cu\u2083N, yielding short-range\u2013ordered Li\u2013Cu\u2013N. Across both families, cyclic voltammetry, LSV/Tafel analysis, and impedance spectroscopy reveal earlier cathodic onset (\u224860\u2013120 mV), reduced charge-transfer resistance (R_ct down to ~16 \u03a9 from ~79 \u03a9 for pristine), and favorable potential-of-zero-charge (PZC) shifts within the operating window.

Electrolyte-cation spike and rinse\u2013swap controls decouple double-layer effects from materials changes: gains on undoped Cu\u2083N vanish after rinsing, whereas Na-modified and Li-amorphous electrodes retain performance. The results delineate two complementary design paradigms lattice-level Na incorporation and controlled Li-induced amorphization that embed a beneficial interfacial field and accelerate NO\u2083RR without reactor or electrolyte redesign.",

    "title": "Crystal Growth, Structures and Optical Bandgaps of Cuprous Rare-Earth Molybdates",
    "summary": "Cuprous-oxide semiconductors have been growing in research interest because of their promising optical and catalytic properties for solar energy conversion. While much recent research has focused on binary and ternary cuprous oxides, the more structurally complex quaternary and higher systems remain significantly less explored. Crystal growth in the cuprous rare-earth (RE) molybdate system has been investigated using high temperature and arc-melting synthesis techniques. Prior studies show the formation of two closely related compounds in these systems, occurring as either Cu6RE4(MoO4)9 (Space group: R3c, No. 161; exclusive for RE = La) or CuRE(MoO4)2 (Space group: Pbca, No. 61; for R = Nd and heavier REs). By contrast, our new synthetic investigations for RE = Ce and La demonstrate the crystallization of both structure types, i.e., as red-colored crystals of Cu6RE4(MoO4)9 (RE = La(1) or Ce(2)) and as yellow-colored crystals of CuRE(MoO4)2 (RE = La(3) or Ce(4)), as obtained by slow cooling from 950 oC and from arc-melting techniques, respectively. Both structures similarly consist of [MoO4]2- tetrahedra bridged either by highly-distorted CuO4 tetrahedra and CeO9 tricapped trigonal prisms in 1 and 2 or by T-shaped CuO3 and CeO8 square antiprisms in 3 and 4. Optical UV-Vis diffuse reflectance measurements on powders of CuRE(MoO4)2 for RE = La, Ce, Sm, Eu, and Yb show relatively larger direct bandgaps in the range of 2.36 to 2.47 eV, while the crystals of Cu6RE4(MoO4)9 for RE = La and Ce yield smaller indirect bandgaps of about 1.89 to 2.05 eV. Electronic structure calculations show bandgaps which stem predominantly from electronic transitions between the filled 3d10-based orbitals of the Cu(I) cations and the empty d-based orbitals of the Mo(VI) cations. Thus, the RE cations are found to have an indirect effect on the optical bandgaps via changes in the local coordination environments of each of these cations. The change in crystal structure, such as from Cu6Ce4(MoO4)9 to CuCe(MoO4)2, has a dramatically larger effect of decreasing the bandgap by ~0.4 to 0.5 eV as compared to only changing the RE cation within the same structure type. In summary, new synthetic investigation of the quaternary cuprous molybdates has elucidated the impact of RE cations on their crystal structures, compositions, and visible-light bandgaps, with the underlying relationships revealed via electronic structure calculations.",

Combined with differently sized complete active space approaches (CASSCF), this method enables a decomposition of the magnetic coupling constant J into its underlying physical contributions. Herein, we extend the VIEH framework to complexes with multiple magnetic coupling pathways. This approach is showcased with a homologous series of [M2(\u03bc\u2212O)(NH3)n]2+ complexes including Cu(II), Ni(II), and Fe(II). Typically, antiferromagnetic coupling progressively weakens from copper to nickel and iron. We demonstrate that this weakening arises primarily from an increase in the ferromagnetic coupling contribution across this series.",

While a role for ATG18/WIPI4 in targeting ATG2A to the IM is well established, how ATG2A is recruited to the ER remains unclear. In this study, we found that MOSPD3, an atypical VAP family protein, acts an adaptor that recruits ATG2A to the ER. MOSPD3 colocalizes with ATG2A and is specifically enriched at ER sites juxtaposed with the IM during autophagosome formation. Recruitment is mediated by direct interactions between the FFNT (two phenylalanines in a neutral tract) motif in the N-terminal region (NT) of ATG2A and the major sperm protein (MSP) domain of MOSPD3. Co-expression of MOSPD3 with ATG2A-NT, but not a MOSPD3-binding-defective mutant ATG2A-NT-T362A, markedly rescued the autophagic defect caused by ATG2A/B double knockout (DKO). MOSPD3 depletion abolishes ATG2A recruitment to the ER and impedes autophagic flux. Together, this study demonstrates that MOSPD3 functions as an ER adaptor for ATG2A in autophagy.",

There are currently no clinically approved therapeutics or vaccines specifically for NiV. A major hurdle in the drug development pipeline is the high mutation rate of RNA viruses, which allows them to rapidly evolve resistance against site-specific inhibitors. This research project utilizes a multi-layered computational strategy to identify a small-molecule inhibitor capable of targeting the viral polymerase while maintaining efficacy against the predicted high-probability W730A resistance mutation. Through a first-principles assessment of the viral polymerase structure (PDB: 9KNZ), I established a design constraint called Allosteric Independence. This requires any lead candidate to bind in a pocket that is geometrically distinct from the mutation site W730, thereby preventing steric or electronic disruption upon mutation. After screening a library of 50 high-potential candidates using a rigid-receptor docking protocol, I identified BMS-986205 (Linrodostat), an investigational IDO1 inhibitor, as a superior lead. BMS-986205 demonstrated a binding affinity of -7.17 kcal/mol against the wild-type polymerase and a paradoxical increase to -7.29 kcal/mol against the W730A mutant. Geometric analysis confirmed a physical separation of 6.28 \u00c5 from the mutation site. Given its current status in global Phase 3 clinical trials for oncology, BMS-986205 is a primary candidate for rapid drug repurposing to secure India\u2019s population against future outbreaks.",

    "title": "MINT32: A Minimum-Image INT32 Coordinate Representation for Fast and Accurate Molecular Dynamics on GPUs",
    "summary": "Molecular dynamics simulations on GPUs have historically required a trade-off between performance and numerical precision. Mixed-precision approaches, such as AMBER SPFP and OpenMM, accumulate forces in high precision while representing coordinates in single precision (FP32). This design introduces a fundamental \u201cnoise floor\u201d: quantization error in FP32 coordinates injects artificial heat into the system, degrading long-term stability and distorting kinetic properties.\n\nWe introduce MINT32, a coordinate representation that maps the simulation box onto a 32-bit integer grid. MINT32 achieves a spatial resolution of approximately 0.01 fm, roughly 300 times finer than FP32, without the memory bandwidth penalties associated with 64-bit integer arithmetic. In addition, MINT32 offers algorithmic elegance through self-wrapping, whereby periodic boundary conditions are enforced via exact integer overflow, eliminating branch divergence entirely.\n\nBenchmark results demonstrate that MINT32 reduces energy drift in microcanonical (NVE) simulations by nearly an order of magnitude (7--10x), delivering double-precision-level stability for challenging PME water systems. When paired with single-precision force evaluations, MINT32 outperforms conventional mixed-precision models, indicating that coordinate precision is the dominant factor governing simulation stability in the systems examined. The fixed-point grid further enables constraint solvers (SHAKE) to converge to tolerances of 10A, effectively eliminating constraint instabilities. Our implementation achieves approximately 85\\% of production throughput on consumer-grade GPUs, serving as a conceptual foundation for future molecular dynamics (MD) engines.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to identify an optimal coordinate representation for next-generation MD software. To this end, we present a prototype framework designed to isolate and evaluate the numerical behavior of coordinate representations in molecular dynamics, with a modified version of the AMBER simulation package serving solely as a testbed.",

    "summary": "Selective synthetic routes to prepare boronic esters are highly desirable as they are valuable intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional materials. In this paper, we report a new approach to generate boronic esters through the ring-opening hydroboration of benzylidene cyclobutanes catalysed by magnesium(II) complexes. For the first time, products were accessed through the selective hydroboration of a single C\u2013C sigma-bond of the cyclobutane ring with complete chemoselectivity and high E:Z selectivities (99:1 to 3:1) across a wide range of substrates. The mechanism is proposed to proceed through the hydromagnesiation of the benzylidene cyclobutane, ring-opening by beta-alkyl migration, and subsequent Mg-to-B metathesis. Probe experiments, 11B NMR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations suggest that boronate complexes play a role in catalytic turnover, and that ring-closed hydroborated species form as off-cycle intermediates. The new process represents an important example in which a sustainable and inexpensive magnesium catalyst performs in an entirely complementary manner to transition metal systems.",

    "title": "The growing role of open source software in molecular modeling",
    "summary": "The increasing importance and predictive power of modern molecular modeling, driven by physics- and machine learning-based methods, necessitates a new collaborative architecture to replace the isolated, traditional model of software development. The traditional approach often led to redundant engineering effort, high costs, and opaque systems that limit reproducibility, independent scrutiny, and scientific independence.  \n\nThis perspective advocates for permissively licensed open source software as a scientific and economic multiplier by reducing the duplication of effort, enabling scientific validation of modeling tools, and frictionless experimentation with new ideas. Coordinated, multi-project consortia, such as Open Force Field, Open Free Energy, OpenFold, and OpenADMET have formed to collaboratively build shared computational infrastructure and release all methods under permissive licenses. The success of these large-scale efforts requires organizational structures that extend beyond code. The Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF), a US nonprofit, serves as a domain-specific institutional home and fiscal sponsor. By providing governance, administrative infrastructure, and dedicated research software engineers, OMSF aligns incentives across academic and industrial stakeholders. This framework enables a synergistic ecosystem where projects interoperate to accelerate innovation, eliminate duplication, and ensure long-term software sustainability, thereby creating durable foundations that elevate the entire molecular modeling community.",

    "title": "COLVARS-Driven Reactive Molecular Dynamics of Vitrimer Polymerization and Thermomechanical Property Analysis",
    "summary": "Vitrimers are the new class of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) capable of topological rearrangement through dynamic bond exchange, enabling recyclability, self-healing and stress relaxation while maintaining network integrity. The ring opening of epoxides by carboxylic acids is a fundamental epoxy\u2013acid esterification reaction underlying vitrimer network formation, yet its atomistic mechanism remains challenging to simulate as experimental time scales for crosslinking reactions in polymers range from minutes to hours\u2014far beyond the reach of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this work, we employ biased MD using the Collective Variables (COLVARS) module in LAMMPS combined with a reactive ReaxFF potential to promote the ring-opening reaction between Diglycidyl Ether of Bisphenol A (DGEBA) and oxalic acid. Three coupled collective variables were designed to represent epoxide C\u2013O bond cleavage, C(epoxide)\u2013O(acid) bond formation, and proton transfer between acid and epoxide oxygens. This external bias promotes nucleophilic addition of acid-derivedcarboxylate oxygen to the epoxide carbon, resulting in ring opening, followed by proton transfer to yield the \u03b2-hydroxy ester functionality characteristic of vitrimer networks. This method allows simulating cross-linking at realistic, low, temperatures which helps to mimic chemical reactions and avoids unwanted high-temperature side reactions. Since not all accelerated events lead to the desired product, careful selection of initial configurations, molecular orientations, and suitable external bias parameters increases the probability of meaningful simulation results. Furthermore, the stability of the resulting vitrimer was evaluated in the absence of any external bias, and its thermomechanical properties were subsequently analyzed. Results show that the biased MD approach successfully captures the atomistic steps of the esterification reaction and the resulting vitrimer network can be used for accurate prediction of thermomechanical properties.",

    "summary": "Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) are a versatile family of porous materials whose modular architecture enables tunable structural diversity and functional versatility. biological MOFs extend this concept by incorporating biomolecules as linkers, introducing biocompatibility and catalytic functionality. \nHere we performed the in situ construction of MOF elements through the direct involvement of enzymes during framework formation. In the absence of enzymes, Ni\u2013MOFs exhibited a typical compact, closed morphology, whereas enzyme-assisted synthesis produced well-defined microsnowflake-like structures. The formation process was rapid, and extended synthesis times did not induce changes in the final morphology. Notably, the enzyme structure played a key role in determining the final architecture; the use of larger enzymes, such as catalase, resulted in the formation of a sandwich-like layered structure. Structural characterization confirmed the formation of a porous material with an average pore size of revealing an average pore diameter ranging from 3 to 6 nm and pore volumes between 0.17 and 0.22 cm\u00b3/g .  Also Ni-ELFs hybrid showed  surface area from 82 of m\u00b2/g  to 139 m\u00b2/g (for Ni-ELF 1). Fluorescent labeling of the protein allowed the localization of the enzyme within the flake-like structures, revealing its preferential distribution at the periphery while leaving the central region accessible, thereby generating a novel hierarchical hybrid porous material.\nTo evaluate catalytic efficiency, ELFs were tested in hydrolytic reactions as esterase/lipase-mimic catalysts. In this context, Ni-based ELFs outperformed free lipases with ELF-1 exhibiting the highest catalytic activity compared to other ELF hybrids. As a proof of concept for hydrolysis-mimic plastic degradation, ELF-1 demonstrated notable activity in the direct degradation of PET bottle fragments into microstructured products.",

    "title": "Sequence-controlled Rapid Living Anionic Copolymerization of Polystyrene Derivatives Using a Flow Microreactor",
    "summary": "Copolymers play a vital role in a diverse array of functional materials, where their properties are determined by both their molecular weight and monomer sequence. While precise molecular weight control has been achieved in anionic polymerization reactions, sequence control remains a major challenge, particularly in fast copolymerization reactions that occur on the millisecond (ms) timescale. This limitation arises because conventional in situ spectroscopic analyses fail to capture such rapid kinetics in polar solvents, and existing quenched-flow setups are too complex for practical use. Here, we report a modular flow- microreactor platform that enables both kinetic analysis and sequence control in a fast, living anionic copolymerization reaction. By exploiting ms-scale mixing and quenching, we determined the propagation rate constants for the copolymerization of styrene and tert-butoxystyrene using the Beckingham\u2013Sanoja\u2013Lynd model, providing the first quantitative kinetic insight into such a rapid anionic system. Furthermore, by controlling the monomer feed based on the obtained rate constants, we achieved the synthesis of pseudo-random, gradient, and block copolymers. The pseudo-random copolymer exhibits low glass-transition temperatures and high solubility. This work provides a practical and quantitative approach for analyzing ms-scale polymerization processes and offers a general platform that combines reaction kinetics with polymer-sequence design, thus opening new opportunities for the rational development of functional materials through living anionic polymerization.",

    "title": "Mechanochemical Activation of Spiropyran in PMMA - A Hybrid Quantum Chemical/Atomistic/Coarse-Grained Approach",
    "summary": "Embedding mechanophores into polymer matrices to activate mechanochemical reactions has been extensively employed to realize diverse functional applications. Spiropyran (SP) is a widely used mechanophore that undergoes force-induced isomerization into its activated merocyanine (MC) form, accompanied by a color change. To accurately simulate the SP-MC isomerization process under tension, the present work introduces a large-scale hybrid coarse-grained/atomistic (CG/AA) model in which poly(methyl metacrylate) (PMMA) monomers are represented by in dividual beads, while SP remains fully described at the AA level. We used force field parameters derived from quantum chemical (QC) data, employing the fully atomistic framework previously developed by our group. The underlying CG PMMA force field was reparameterized to match experimental bulk properties and compared with a corresponding atomistic force field. This approach enabled deformation simulations of significantly larger systems than possible with a pure AA force field, at reduced computational cost, thereby providing novel insights into force transduction and mechanophore activation. Furthermore, a parabolic stress distribution was observed along individual PMMA chains, resulting in preferential SP activation near chain centers. Non specific chain scission events occurred far less frequently than SP activations. The developed hybrid model offers a powerful framework for investigating more complex mechanophore doped polymer networks.",

Here, we report a tricyclic scaffold inspired by amitriptyline, modified to incorporate opioid pharmacophore features including a phenolic hydroxyl and a tertiary amine side chain. Computational docking of the ligand against the \u03bc-opioid receptor was performed across nine poses, with interactions analyzed using PLIP [4]. The ligand engages a conserved hydrophobic pocket (ILE 245, VAL 249, ILE 271, TRP 242) and forms hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with polar residues (HIS 3, ASP 96, TYR 97/275). Our results suggest that this tricyclic scaffold is compatible with the \u03bc-opioid receptor binding site and may serve as a starting point for further medicinal chemistry optimization.",

    "summary": "Electrons have internal structure, you cannot have spin without internal structure, you  cannot have chemistry without spin, computing with out an explicit model for spin has  made chemists\u2019 lives hard.  We present a deterministic framework for computational chemistry that replaces the  probabilistic wave function with a classical electromagnetic model of the electron possessing  internal temporal structure. By recognizing the electron as a half-photon electromagnetic  field configuration oscillating between two temporal poles separated by \u03b40 = \u03bbC /2 \u22481.21  pm, we resolve the classical radiation catastrophe and recover atomic stability without quan-  tum axioms. The electron\u2019s energy resides entirely in the half-photon field oscillation at  frequency \u03c90 = mec2/\u210f, not in electrostatic self-energy of the temporal poles. Angular mo-  mentum conservation (L= \u210f) makes the electron stiff against stretching but compressible  under strong nuclear fields, with compression energy E(\u03b4) = \u210fc/\u03b4 increasing hyperbolically  as \u03b4 < \u03b40. This temporal structure naturally regularizes the nuclear Coulomb potential,  predicting the hydrogen ground state to 0.18% accuracy. The exchange interaction emerges  as magnetic phase-locking between antiparallel electron pairs, calibrated from Cooper pair  coherence lengths in superconductors. This mechanism reproduces the lithium ionization  energy (0.8% error) and derives nitrogen\u2019s sp3 geometry from magnetic dipole packing con-  straints. The Pauli exclusion principle arises from two physical mechanisms: (1) compressed  electrons cannot phase-lock with uncompressed electrons due to frequency mismatch, and  (2) half-photon analytic paths resist spatial overlap. The model offers O(N2) computational  scaling for molecular systems, presenting a classical alternative to density functional theory.",

    "summary": "Amid the alarming threat of pollution, the electrocatalytic pathway stands out as a frontrunner, offering a promising strategy for clean energy conversion and environmental remediation. However, despite its immense potential, the practical substitution of the industrial process remains an elusive target. Despite conducting considerable research for over a century, the primary problem remains the engineering of an efficient and durable electrocatalyst to overcome bottlenecks and convert electrochemical pathways into viable, scalable technologies. Herein, this work transcends a comprehensive review by bridging material breakthroughs with their fundamental mechanistic insights and, through a meticulous analysis of existing experimental studies, reveals how either a small magnetic field or a fictitious magnetic field orchestrates complex catalytic pathways, positioning itself as a cornerstone work to propel the future of magneto-electrochemistry. The material aspects cover not only the already tested materials but also draw a new roadmap for advanced quantum materials that can change the landscape of spin-based catalysis research. Ultimately, the integration of complex materials with dynamic mechanistic understanding, rational cell engineering across diverse applications, and AI- and ML-driven predictive design is poised to revolutionize magnetic-field-assisted catalysis. This unified and adaptive framework for magneto-electrocatalysis not only delineates existing challenges but also illuminates sustainable and scalable pathways toward next-generation energy conversion, environmental remediation, and green chemical manufacturing.",

    "summary": "Selective synthetic routes to prepare boronic esters are highly desirable as they are valuable intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional materials. In this paper, we report a new approach to generate boronic esters through the ring-opening hydroboration of benzylidene cyclobutanes catalysed by magnesium(II) complexes. For the first time, products were accessed through the selective hydroboration of a single C\u2013C sigma-bond of the cyclobutane ring with complete chemoselectivity and high E:Z selectivities (99:1 to 3:1) across a wide range of substrates. The mechanism is proposed to proceed through the hydromagnesiation of the benzylidene cyclobutane, ring-opening by beta-alkyl migration, and subsequent Mg-to-B metathesis. Probe experiments, 11B NMR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations suggest that boronate complexes play a role in catalytic turnover, and that ring-closed hydroborated species form as off-cycle intermediates. The new process represents an important example in which a sustainable and inexpensive magnesium catalyst performs in an entirely complementary manner to transition metal systems.",

    "summary": "The development of molecular post-modification design strategies that enable low-temperature pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) remains an underexplored area. The current state of the art for the pyrolysis of PS demands heating above 400\u00b0C which creates economic barriers to commercial-scale monomer recovery. Here, we demonstrate the post-functionalization of the PS backbone with a labile C-S bond, specifically a trifluoromethylthio group (SCF3), to accelerate the depolymerization of PS at lower temperatures. We first adapted the trifluoromethylthiolation reaction to PS which involved solvent screening and reaction optimization. We observed a significant increase in the depolymerization of PS-SCF3 compared to PS across a wide range of molecular weights and consumer-grade products at 300\u00b0C. Using the Flynn-Ozawa-Wall analysis, the average apparent activation energy for the depolymerization of PS-SCF3 is ~11kJ/mol lower than pristine PS. To benchmark this protocol, we found that the pyrolysis of several consumer-grade PS-SCF3 samples at 300\u00b0C offered greater amounts of styrene compared to pristine consumer-grade PS. This study explores the possibilities of post-functionalizing the backbone of PS to depolymerize PS at faster timescales and lower temperatures to afford greater recovery of styrene, contributing towards a circular economy of plastics.",

    "summary": "Molecular mechanisms governing initiation steps of the assembly of thousands of endogenous multi-protein complexes (EMCs) remain incompletely understood. Here, multiple lines of observations are reported reflecting the biological functions-aligned initiation sequence of hybrid assembly pathways (HAPs) of EMCs. HAPs postulate the creation of cell type-specific intracellular pools of hetero- and homodimers as the first step of chain reactions of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of EMCs\u2019 assemblies. The consensus action sequence of HAPs consists of: a) Initiation on genomic DNA templates of the formation of metastable hetero- and homodimers of EMCs\u2019 protein constituents; b) Release of dimers from DNA templates for delivery to the EMCs assembly compartments; c) Assembly of defined EMCs by sequential on demand addition to preformed dimers serving as attractors of EMC-specific monomers\u2019 ensembles. Chromosome-na\u00efve scaffolds of PPIs contributing to creation of intracellular dimer pools constitute genome-wide networks of binding sites for 716 transcription factors (TFs), 534 of which manifest patterns of significantly enriched expression in 1358 brain regions. The initiators\u2019 loci of HAPs appear to operate within nucleosome-depleted islands of transposable elements (TE) \u2013 derived sequences within transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. Performance of PPI DNA template-guided assembly lines of EMCs is illustrated in two concurrent modes of PPI cascades: TF-TF PPI chains and TF-PPI Hub protein chains. Regardless of the number of DNA-bound TFs initiating the multistep PPI sequences at PPI initiators (ranging from one to 716 TFs), both modes of operations reached the equilibrium at the PPI constituents saturation levels of ~245 proteins for TF-TF PPI and of ~351 proteins for TF-PPI Hub Proteins\u2019 assembly chains. Regardless of TF panels bound at HAP initiators, proteins of PPI-guided ensembles are enriched in either defined sets of neuroanatomical structures (TF-TF PPI path) or among structural-functional constituents of synapses (PPI Hub proteins path). Examples of default operation modes of DNA-template-guided assemblies of hetero- and homodimers of Yamanaka factors, neurogenesis constituents, and principal protein components of postsynaptic density of excitatory and inhibitory synaptogenesis are reported. Altogether, this contribution reports the foundational evidence for further experimental and theoretical explorations of retrotransposon-seeded genome-wide codes for initiators of PPI chain reactions of protein dimerization creating pools of attractors to guide and accelerate the EMC assemblies.",

    "title": "Effect of PEG Chain Length on the Water Solubility of Monodisperse PEG-Appended Molecules",
    "summary": "Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a nonionic and highly water-soluble polymer, and PEGylation is widely used as a versatile chemical strategy to enhance the water solubility of otherwise poorly soluble molecules. The rational design of PEG-appended materials, therefore, requires an estimation of the PEG chain length necessary to achieve the desired level of solubility. Here, we investigated the relationship between the PEG chain length and the water solubility of PEG-appended molecules using a combination of experimental and computational approaches. We focused on monodisperse PEG with a discrete molecular weight, which enables us to identify the relationship between chain length and physicochemical properties, as represented by water solubility. Then, we designed a series of PEG\u2011appended molecules bearing monodisperse PEG chains of varying lengths, and measured their water solubilities experimentally. In parallel, molecular dynamics-based alchemical free\u2011energy calculations yielded thermodynamic trends that reproduced the observed dependence of solubility on PEG chain length. Comparison of experimental and computational results showed that the calculations not only distinguished between water-soluble and insoluble PEG-appended molecules but also captured the solubility trends for moderately soluble species. These findings demonstrate the potential of molecular-dynamics-based free-energy calculations for a priori prediction of the water solubility of PEG-appended molecules.",

Here, we report that the Red box, a fully organic macrocyclic cationic receptor, exhibits high-affinity and selectivity for G4 structures. Biophysical analyses reveal that the Red box binds the c-MYC G4 with nanomolar affinity, stronger than most reported c-MYC ligands. Notably, the Red box displays greater selectivity for c-MYC over duplex DNA compared to the well-characterized porphyrin TMPyP4 and its macrocyclic architecture is essential for this activity, as its acyclic analogue displays negligible G4 stabilization. In cellular assays, treatment with non-cytotoxic concentrations of the Red box selectively downregulated c-MYC expression in HEK293T cells, with minimal effects on c-KIT and hTERT. Furthermore, c-MYC suppression was proportional to its basal expression across several cell lines, supporting a G4-mediated mechanism.",

    "summary": "All-inorganic halide perovskites, especially CsPbBr3 microcrystals, are often considered to be \noptically stable and less defect-prone compared to their organometallic counterparts. \nNevertheless, reports of photoluminescence (PL) blinking in bulk perovskite systems till date \nare restricted to organometallic halide perovskite nano-/microrods, leaving it an open question \nwhether similar intermittency behaviour can be observed in all-inorganic halide perovskites of \ncomparable dimensions. Intriguingly, we witnessed multi-level PL fluctuations (flickering) in \nindividual green-emitting CsPbBr3 microrods. Wide-field PL microscopy reveals that the \nintensity fluctuations are nearly identical along the microrod, owing to charge carrier migration,  \nand waveguide\u2011assisted propagation. Our measurements on single microrod suggests that the \nflickering dynamics is strongly influenced by excitation power, excitation energy, and local \nenvironmental constituents. Under dry argon environment, a sharp reduction in the PL intensity \nis observed, indicating the formation of large number of nonradiative (NR) centers which \nquenches all the photogenerated carriers, suppressing overall emission intensity and PL \nflickering. The exposure of oxygen passivates these NR traps generated under argon, while \nhumidity introduces metastable photoinduced NR traps (\u201cspecial quenchers\u201d) that govern the \nenhanced flickering behaviours. Our findings establish that spatiotemporally correlated \nintermittency is not limited to organometallic perovskites but extends to all-inorganic \nperovskite bulk emitters as well and provides new insights into the role of transient defects and \natmospheric constituents in dictating emission stability.",

The spatio-functional relationship between transcription of rRNA and nucleolar substructures and how this adapts to cellular stress remain incompletely understood. In this study, we resolve the sub nucleolar structures using expansion microscopy to reveal ordered structures of fibrillar center (FC) and dense fibrillar component (DFC) domains as nested shells, which is reorganized upon cellular stress like DNA damage or RNA polymerase I (RNAPI) inhibition. Direct visualization of nascent (5' ETS) and mature (28S) rRNA suggested that rRNA synthesis is the critical regulator of nucleolar size, and organization. Nucleolar reorganization upon stress emerges to be a direct function of nascent rRNA levels. Stress-induced transcription inhibition remodels the sub-nucleolar compartments from a viscoelastic state into solid-like condensates thereby perturbing the nucleolar pH gradient due to the missing rRNA scaffold. We show, that rather than signalling to mediate rDNA repair, nucleolar reorganization naturally arises primarily from reduced rRNA levels and the resultant biophysical restructuring of the nucleolus under cellular stress.",

    "summary": "Unraveling the kinetics of transcriptional regulation is a central challenge in molecular biology. Traditional inference methods based on cell-to-cell mRNA variability are limited because mRNA levels reflect not only transcriptional activity but also post-transcriptional processes. Recent advances in quantifying nascent RNAs across isogenic cells provide a more direct readout of transcriptional dynamics. Here, we present a moments-based theoretical framework that leverages nascent RNA data to infer transcriptional kinetics. We derive closed-form expressions for the first two time-dependent moments of nascent RNA across three canonical transcription models and demonstrate that nascent RNA exhibits distinct transient overshoots and higher Fano factors compared to mature mRNA. Through analysis of synthetic datasets, we show that these features enable more accurate estimation of transcriptional kinetics and allow reliable model selection, distinguishing single from multi-pathway promoter activation with over 75% accuracy even from small sample sizes. We further validated our model selection method using real experimental transcription datasets in yeast and E. coli cells, with nascent RNA demonstrating superior performance in identifying cross-talk pathway regulation. Our framework thus offers a computationally efficient and mechanistically informative approach for decoding transcriptional dynamics, emphasizing the advantages of time-dependent nascent RNA measurements over mature mRNA in capturing the true kinetics of transcriptional regulation.",

    "summary": "Therapeutic peptides combine the advantages of small molecules and antibodies, offering target flexibility and low immunogenicity, yet their successful translation requires careful evaluation of multiple developability properties beyond binding alone. As chemically modified peptides become increasingly common in drug design, no unified platform currently supports systematic property assessment across both canonical sequences and SMILES-based representations. Leveraging the generalizability of large foundational models trained on protein and chemical data, we introduce PeptiVerse, a universal therapeutic peptide property prediction platform. PeptiVerse accepts either amino acid sequences or chemically modified peptide SMILES, delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse property prediction tasks, and provides both a web interface and open-source implementation for rapid, accessible, and scalable peptide developability analysis. By unifying property prediction across representations, PeptiVerse directly supports early-stage peptide therapeutic development campaigns and property-aware generative design workflows.

    "summary": "TMEM16A is a Ca2+-activated anion channel that provides direct electrical feedback to the plasma membrane in response to intracellular Ca2+. Its conductive state remains unresolved, leaving questions about gating, Cl- permeation, and modulation by Ca2+, depolarization, and lipids. To investigate the open state, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of TMEM16A bound to the putative open-state blocker 1PBC. After inhibitor removal, the putative, pore-lining helix TM4 developed kinks at two sites: an upper site that opens the pore for Cl- permeation, and a deeper site causing constriction. A conserved hydrophobic network between TM3 and TM4 persisted in most open structures but separated during extreme dilation, allowing lipids to transiently block the pore. Patch-clamp recordings indicated that the intact network promotes activation. Further simulations yielded > 60 Cl- permeation events and a single-channel conductance matching experiments. Additional electrostatic and kinetic modeling indicated that TMEM16As transition from outward-rectification to Ohmic conductance with increasing Ca2+ results from a weak voltage dependence of Ca2+ binding, which act cooperatively to open the pore.",

    "title": "Nanodisc-Mediated Visualization of Crowding-Induced Condensation and Membrane Reorganization in Two-Dimensional Membrane Environments",
    "summary": "Although biological membranes exhibit complex and dynamic organization, the mechanistic role of molecular crowding in governing lateral membrane heterogeneity remains poorly characterized experimentally. Here, we provide direct experimental visualization showing that crowding-induced condensation of membrane-anchored macromolecules above the bilayer interface reorganizes membrane dynamics and gives rise to spatially heterogeneous lipid mobility. Both PEGylated lipids and membrane-anchored proteins undergo surface-density-driven condensation on supported lipid bilayers, forming immobile regions that constrain lipid diffusion. Notably, the condensation threshold varies inversely with PEG chain length and surface density, defining a quantitative relationship between molecular size and crowding strength. To directly visualize these crowding-induced structures, we employed nanodelivery using lipid-loaded nanodiscs, revealing a clear correspondence between condensed crowder regions and diffusion barriers reminiscent of the picket-fence model of live-cell membranes. Similar condensation behavior observed for protein-crowded SLBs demonstrates the generality of this crowding-driven mechanism. Together, these findings establish surface-density-driven crowding and condensation of membrane-anchored macromolecules as a key physical mechanism underlying lateral membrane inhomogeneity and position nanodelivery as a general approach for interrogating membrane organization across synthetic and biological systems.",

    "title": "Superimposed Coding of Count Fingerprints to Binary Fingerprints",
    "summary": "Many cheminformatics workflows use Tanimoto similarity between binary fingerprints. When count fingerprints may be more appropriate, the benefit is often not large enough to justify replacing existing clustering tools, database search components, and other often highly optimized binary methods. This paper proposes a novel method based on random superimposed coding to convert count fingerprints to binary fingerprints such that the binary Tanimoto similarity between two binary fingerprints better approximates the multiset Tanimoto similarity between their original count form. In particular, the k-recall@k score for -nearest neighbor search is consistently better than hash-based folding or RDKit's count simulation conversion across the four count fingerprint generators in the RDKit, if the number of features is relatively small compared to the binary fingerprint size. For example, with 2048-bit Morgan fingerprints of radius 3, the recall at  for folded, count simulation, and superimposed coding are approximately 0.80, 0.86, and 0.94, respectively.",

    "summary": "The Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP) unifies several landmark quantum algorithms, yet systematic exploration of its variants and modern applications has slowed. This paper revives HSP-based algorithm design by examining new group structures with direct relevance to post-quantum cryptography, lattice problems, and structured optimization. We classify a family of finite and continuous groups-extensions and semi-direct products of abelian groups, matrix groups, and certain non-abelian groups-according to their Fourier-theoretic properties and the feasibility of efficient quantum Fourier transforms (QFTs). For each class, we determine whether the HSP admits an efficient quantum algorithm, a subexponential-time quantum algorithm, or appears intractable even quantumly. We construct explicit algorithms for eight new problem families, including structured lattice enumeration, automorphism groups of certain graphs, and algebraic attack primitives appearing in code-based and multivariate cryptosystems. For these, we show superpolynomial quantum speedups over all known classical approaches under standard complexity assumptions. We also discuss how approximate and block-encoded QFTs can be combined with variational post-processing to make some of these HSP algorithms more NISQ-friendly. Our results demonstrate that algebraic-structure-based quantum algorithms remain a rich and underexploited direction with both theoretical depth and potential cryptanalytic and optimization applications.",

    "summary": "Genome-scale metabolic network (GSMN) models are rigorously curated, cellular-level representations of metabolism that enable flux-based metabolite fate discovery, metabolic engineering, drug target identification and context-specific multi-omics integration. However, the inherent complexity of model architectures, need for programming skills and limited visualization support restrict their broader applicability. Existing tools focus on visualization and analyses separately, necessitating tool-specific format conversions, offer either topology or flux analyses options exclusively, lack intuitive pathway-specific visualizations, database-integrated model refinement, pathway enrichment and large-scale perturbation analyses. Here, we present NAViFluX (metabolic Network Analysis and Visualization of Flux), a visualization-centric, web browser-based environment that unifies GSMN exploration through native pathway/subsystem map generation using various layouts; interactive refinement through addition of reactions from KEGG/BiGG, amending constraints, pathway merging; and modules for flux computations, topology, functional enrichment. Instead of treating visualization as a post hoc step, NAViFluX performs all actions within network views, enabling users to make decisions directly from visually interpretable subnetworks. Using three Escherichia coli case studies, NAViFluX is shown to characterize nutrient-specific metabolic adaptations, improve metabolic gene essentiality predictions, provide mechanistic insight into synthetic lethality and facilitate the design of an optimized carbon-fixing metabolic state, thereby democratizing GSMNs for biologically meaningful applications.",
