    "title": "Female moths incorporate plant acoustic emissions into their oviposition decision-making process",
    "summary": "Insects rely on plants\u2019 visual, chemical, tactile, and electrical cues when making various decisions. A recent study demonstrated that dehydrated plants emit ultrasonic sounds within the auditory sensitivity range of many moth species. In this study, we sought to determine whether insects also rely on plant acoustic signals when making decisions. We investigated whether female moths rely on ultrasonic clicks which are typically produced by dehydrated plants when deciding where to oviposit. In the absence of an actual plant, the moths indeed preferred to lay their eggs in proximity to acoustic signals which represent dehydrating plants. Tracking the moths\u2019 behavior prior to the decision showed that they examined both sides of the arena and gradually spent more time on the acoustic-playback side. Interestingly, when actual plants were added to the arena, the oviposition preference was reversed and the moths preferred silent plants, which is in accordance with their a priori preference for hydrated plants. Deafening the moths eliminated their preference, confirming that the choice was based on hearing. Moreover, the presence of male moths, including their auditory signals, did not affect their oviposition decision, suggesting that the response was specific to plant sound emissions. We reveal evidence for a first acoustic interaction between moths and plants, but as plants emit various sounds, our findings hint at the existence of more currently unknown insect-plant acoustic interactions.",

    "title": "Population analyses reveal heterogenous encoding in the medial prefrontal cortex during naturalistic foraging",
    "summary": "Foraging in the wild requires coordinated switching of critical functions, including goal-oriented navigation and context-appropriate action selection. Nevertheless, few studies have examined how different functions are represented in the brain during naturalistic foraging. To address this question, we recorded multiple single-unit activities from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats seeking a sucrose reward in the presence of an unpredictable attack posed by a robotic predator (Lobsterbot). Simultaneously recorded ensemble activities from neurons were analyzed in reference to various behavioral indices as the animal moved freely across the foraging area (F) between the nest (N) and the goal (E) area. An artificial neural network, trained with simultaneously recorded neural activity, estimated the rat\u2019s current distance from the Lobsterbot. The accuracy of distance estimation was the highest in the middle F-zone in which the dominant behavior was active navigation. The spatial encoding persisted in the N-zone when non-navigational behaviors such as grooming, rearing, and sniffing were excluded. In contrast, the accuracy decreased as the animal approached the E-zone, when the activity of the same neuronal ensembles was more correlated with events related to dynamic decision-making between food procurement and Lobsterbot evasion. A population-wide analysis confirmed highly heterogeneous encoding by the region. To further assess the decision-related activity in the E-zone, a naive Bayesian classifier was trained to predict the success and failure of avoidance behavior. The classifier predicted the avoidance outcome as much as 6 s before the head withdrawal. In addition, two sub-populations of recorded units with distinct temporal dynamics contributed differently to the prediction. These findings suggest that an overlapping population of mPFC neurons may switch between two heterogeneous modes, encoding relevant locations for goal-directed navigation or an imminent situational challenge.",

    "title": "Synaptation - a missing concept in the science of evolved complexity",
    "summary": "The concept of synaptation is introduced to explain how natural selection can generate complex, higher-level traits in collectives that lack a shared inheritance mechanism. The traditional approach, based on Lewontin's \"recipe\" for natural selection, excludes such emergent traits from the adaptation-exaptation taxonomy. Yet individual organism fitness is often mediated by collective, non-linear interactions within systems that cannot themselves sustain heredity. To address this, multilevel selection (MLS) theory is extended in the form of synaptive MLS, a process through which heterogeneous task groups evolve emergent traits, called synaptations, via irreducible, non-additive cross-level selective covariance. Synaptive MLS differs from trait-group selection because collective function depends on causal entanglement among heterogenous entities with diverse fates, rather than a common trait that links entities to a shared fate. This framework applies to conspecific divisions of labor, multi-species consortia and holobiont integration, where coordination of distinct roles yields emergent fitness effects. Synaptation recognizes how natural selection can contribute to emergent functions by coordinating adaptive, exaptive, and neutral organism-level traits whose lower-level roles scaffold higher-level selected effects. Synaptation and adaptation define the endpoints of a continuum of selected-effect complexity. Recognition of this continuum extends the Darwinian paradigm to adaptive complexity in systems that fail classical heredity requirements and offers an evolutionary lens for understanding relational phenomena such as eubiosis, dysbiosis, and rebiosis in holobionts.",

    "title": "Learning a PRECISE language for small-molecule binding",
    "summary": "Virtual screening of billion-scale compound libraries has become feasible through machine learning approaches. In particular, CoNCISE (RECOMB 2025) introduced drug quantization via codebooks, achieving highly scalable and accurate binary predictions. However, drug discovery requires understanding not just whether molecules bind, but where they bind and how to target specific sites. Here, we present PRECISE which leverages CoNCISE's quantized small-molecule representations while operating on the target's 3D structure as its input. The key innovation of PRECISE is reimagining drug-target interaction as compatibility between quantized drug embeddings and a latent representation of the target's surface mesh, enriched with electrostatic and geometric features. PRECISE designs a novel surface representation, interpreted through a geometric deep learning architecture, enabling it to identify binding sites more accurately than state-of-the-art methods (DiffDock-L, Chai, and Boltz-2) while the codebook ensures billion-scale screening capability. Our formulation unlocks zero-shot generalization to complex targets such as metalloproteins and multi-chain complexes. To enable efficient integration with downstream docking workflows, we introduce PRECISE-MCTS, which combines fast PRECISE-based screening with selective Vina docking through an iterative Monte Carlo Tree Search approach. By providing both mechanistic understanding and massive scalability, PRECISE delivers capabilities that were previously mutually exclusive in virtual screening.",

    "summary": "Protein sequences are commonly interpreted through biochemical and evolutionary lenses, emphasizing structure-function relationships and selection in sequence space. Here we develop a complementary viewpoint: proteins as statistical languages, strings over a finite alphabet generated by constrained stochastic processes. We formalize intrinsic informational descriptors of protein ensembles, including composition entropy H1, adjacent mutual information I1, and separation-dependent information profiles Id. A null-model ladder (uniform, composition-matched i.i.d., and Markov-1) separates compositional effects from genuine positional dependence. We then evaluate these descriptors empirically across 20 UniProt reference proteomes spanning major clades, using protein-level bootstrap resampling and matched synthetic controls. Real proteomes consistently depart from composition-matched i.i.d. baselines and exhibit information profiles that remain elevated beyond the decay expected under first-order Markov surrogates, indicating dependencies beyond local transition statistics. Finally, a compressibility proxy (gzip) provides an orthogonal signature of redundancy relative to i.i.d. controls at matched composition. Together, these results support the view of proteomes as constrained statistical languages and provide model-agnostic fingerprints for comparing sequence ensembles. These signatures provide a lightweight diagnostic layer for comparing proteomes prior to mechanistic modeling.",

    "title": "Distinct mechanisms drive post-antibiotic Tuberculosis relapse post-cure versus post-treatment-failure",
    "summary": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health concern, as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infects a quarter of the world's population. Though many TB patients sterilize infection with treatment regimens including the current standard, incomplete sterilization leads to post-treatment relapse and development of drug resistance. Two mechanisms have been hypothesized as driving relapse: persistence, where treatment kills all replicating Mtb, and relapse follows once non-replicating Mtb return to a replicative niche; and threshold, where replicating Mtb remain alive, yet below detectable levels. Relapse is often detected through a combination of clinical and bacteriological testing, often clinically described as recurrence of TB <2 years after a \"cure\" diagnosis, while many experimental studies examine relapse ~2-months after treatment completion. Our capacity to untangle these considerations and identify mechanisms driving relapse in vivo are limited. Here, we examine the impact of both threshold and persistence mechanisms on relapse post-treatment completion and post-cure diagnosis using our computational model capturing whole-host Mtb infection dynamics. Simulations show that erroneous TB-negative diagnosis post-treatment (false cure) rates are regimen-specific, specifically, the historic standard HRZE is more likely to result in false cure than the contemporary regimens RMZE or BPaL. We also identify how threshold-driven or persistence-driven relapse correlates with both pre-treatment bacterial burden and diagnostic tests used at treatment completion. Simulations show that post-cure relapse is almost exclusively persistence driven, while threshold-driven relapse is most common without a \"cured\" inclusion criterion. Thus, for patients with negative bacteriological diagnostic results at treatment completion, subsequent relapse may best be personalized by targeting non-replicating Mtb.",

    "summary": "This paper formally defines an operational isomorphism between spectral damping in molecular vibronic systems and neuromodulatory control in biological sensory systems. Without asserting causal continuity or physical identity across scales, we show that both domains instantiate the same class of output-selective control structures, characterized by non-monotonic modulation and bounded state accessibility. Within a minimal operational framework, damping is shown to function not as loss or noise, but as a selector of accessible outputs, leading to effective reductions in observable state spaces under parametric control. This perspective clarifies how neuromodulatory phenomena commonly described as gain modulation cannot, in general, be reduced to monotonic gain models, but instead reflect accessibility-based control. The proposed isomorphism is explicitly limited, falsifiable, and non-metaphorical, establishing a principled bridge between molecular spectroscopy and perceptual neuroscience without invoking consciousness, representation, or subjective experience.",

    "summary": "Environmental damping in molecular spectroscopy is commonly treated as a phenomenological source of decoherence and spectral broadening, leading to a monotonic reduction of spectral intensity. Here we show that this assumption is not generally valid. Using a vibronically resolved response-function framework, we demonstrate that for certain molecular vibronic structures, intermediate damping can enhance observable spectral intensity through redistribution of vibronic interference, without any increase in total oscillator strength. The peak intensity exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on damping strength, characterized by a finite optimal value. This behavior is not universal. Weakly coupled systems lack sufficient spectral overlap to support redistribution, whereas strongly coupled systems exhibit destructive interference due to excessive vibronic density, leading to monotonic suppression. These results indicate that damping can act as a structural selector of spectral accessibility rather than as a purely degradative loss mechanism and clarify the molecular conditions under which environmental coupling reshapes spectroscopic observables.",

    "title": "Theoretical Framework for Absolute Quantification in Digital Immunoassays and Advancements in Microfluidic-Free Droplet-Based Digital Immunoassay Methodologies",
    "summary": "Current single-molecule immunoassays primarily rely on Poisson distribution models, which have limitations in achieving absolute quantification of target proteins. To address this, we developed a novel mathematical model that treats the capture of target proteins by magnetic beads as a discrete Poisson process, while the subsequent washing and secondary sampling steps are modeled using a hypergeometric distribution. Based on this combined distribution model, we constructed a new theoretical framework for digital immunoassays and proposed a calibration\u2011curve\u2011free absolute quantification method based on micro\u2011volume calculation. To validate the feasibility of this model, we established a digital immunoassay platform using a water\u2011in\u2011oil magnetic bead system without the need for complex microfluidic devices. This approach not only eliminates reliance on traditional calibration curves but also demonstrates enhanced feasibility and a broader dynamic range compared to existing methods such as Single Molecule Immunoassays and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassays. Additionally, it allows for the determination of the binding efficiency and accurate blank coefficients of the detection system. Furthermore, the potential application of an internal calibration method within this system is explored. The proposed theoretical framework offers a new strategy to address the challenge of absolute quantification in protein immunoassays, provides important insights for advancing protein quantification methodologies, and supports the development of more precise detection techniques. It is expected to expand the application of digital immunoassays in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",

We identify Src-like adaptor protein (SLAP), a negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, as a key suppressor of SFK activity in the colon. Constitutive and inducible epithelial-specific Slap deletion using a villin-CreERT2 model increases CEC proliferation and accelerates tumorigenesis in the azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS) model. Slap deficiency also enhances SFK-dependent expansion of normal and tumor-derived colonic organoids. Mechanistically, we identify the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB2, an upstream activator of SFKs and CEC proliferation, as an additional SLAP-regulated target. Together, these findings reveal a non-genetic mechanism by which SFKs drive colonic transformation and establish SLAP as a tumor suppressor that constrains oncogenic SFK signaling in the colonic epithelium.",

    "title": "Time-Resolved Analysis of the Cell Wall Proteome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c During Batch Fermentation",
    "summary": "The yeast cell wall is a highly dynamic and multifunctional structure that is essential for maintaining cellular integrity, protecting against environmental stresses, and enabling adhesion, signaling, and interactions with the surrounding environment. Its chemical composition and organization are strongly influenced by external factors such as temperature, pH, nutrient availability and their delivery mode. In batch culture systems, yeast cells grow in a closed environment with limited nutrients, leading to well-defined growth phases that reflect major metabolic transitions. While global proteomic changes during these phases have been described, the temporal regulation of cell wall protein (CWP) expression remains insufficiently characterized. In this study, the temporal remodeling of the cell wall proteome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c was examined during batch cultivation in rich medium over 24 hours. A classical proteomics workflow was applied to analyze CWPs from samples collected at multiple time points over the cultivation period. The analysis revealed substantial qualitative and quantitative changes in CWPs expression linked to metabolic shifts between growth phases. Proteins involved in cell wall remodeling and glycoprotein biosynthesis were particularly enriched at the initial sampling point (b-T0h), corresponding to the transition from flask cultivation to bioreactor conditions, and overall CWP abundance was highest during this early growth stage.

    "title": "Fluorescence based microviscosity mapping in membraneless organelles",
    "summary": "Membraneless organelles (MLOs) are cellular biomolecular condensates formed by liquid-liquid phase separation. Their biological functions are intimately linked to their material properties including viscosity. Condensate viscosity is determined by the size, shape, concentration and molecular interactions between MLOs components. It impacts the diffusion of MLOs constituents and the selective permeability of the condensate, thereby regulating the rate of biochemical reactions. Viscosity modifications associated with liquid-to-gel transition of the condensates are related to pathologies. Current experimental approaches for characterizing the material properties of cellular condensates remain limited. In this study, we report the use of BODIPY-based molecular rotors, in combination with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), to monitor the microviscosity of cellular MLOs directly in living cells. The fluorescence lifetime of BODIPY derivatives increases with the viscosity of their microenvironment, enabling quantitative assessment of microviscosity within condensates. HaloTag technology was employed to specifically label MLO components. Our findings reveal that the nucleolus exhibits higher viscosity than the surrounding nucleoplasm and that microviscosity varies across nucleolar sub-compartments. Furthermore, nucleolar reorganization induced by inhibition of rRNA synthesis results in a measurable increase in microviscosity. Finally, we demonstrate that the microviscosity of stress granules is lower than that of the nucleolus. Overall, presented results demonstrate the strong potential of the BODIPY based molecular rotors as a versatile and powerful tools for probing the material properties of cellular MLOs.",

    "title": "Basement membrane turnover drives filopodial protease-independent invasion",
    "summary": "The basement membrane is a specialised nanoporous extracellular matrix mainly composed of collagen IV fibres and laminins. As collagen IV fibres form covalent cross-links, cells cannot freely cross it. Basement membrane breaching marks the transition from in situ to invasive carcinoma, commonly attributed to protease activity. Yet, recent data show that tumour cells can cross basement membranes through protease-independent mechanisms. Experimental evidence suggests that filopodia can play an active role in pore enlargement in extracellular matrices by generating plastic mechanical deformation. Moreover, plasticity can be regulated by covalent cross-link concentration, which we hypothesise can be responsive to collagen IV turnover, thus generating transient weak spots. To test this, we developed a quantitative, biophysical mathematical model describing the interaction between a tumour-cell cluster and a basement membrane using relevant biological assumptions and parameters. The cluster is represented as an evolving, energetic surface and the basement membrane is described as a set of points representing active and inactive links. Simulations show that synchronisation of collagen IV turnover coupled with filopodium extension drives pore enlargement, providing a mechanistic basis for protease-independent invasion. Consistent with experiments, simulations identify two complementary filopodium groups: one driving global degradation and the other promoting local pore enlargement.",

    "title": "A Genome-Wide Genetic Screen Identifies a Novel kDNA Replication Protein in Trypanosomes",
    "summary": "Trypanosomatid parasites cause diverse diseases in humans and their livestock, but share a unique biological feature, the organization of mitochondrial DNA into a complex structure, named kinetoplast (kDNA), which is crucial for the survival of the parasites. Replication, segregation and expression of kDNA are highly complex processes that involve an estimated ~300 proteins, only a fraction of which have been identified and characterized. Here, we report the development of an unbiased genetic screen in the experimental model Trypanosoma brucei to identify novel factors involved in kDNA maintenance. Our approach uses a combination of genome-wide RNA interference, a novel kDNA staining protocol, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Of the 20 highest-ranked genes identified, six are known kDNA maintenance factors. One hit, Tb927.8.4240, a gene of previously unknown function, was selected for experimental validation and follow-up. Ultrastructure expansion microscopy using a tagged version of the protein reveals a dynamic localization during the cell cycle. RNAi-mediated ablation of Tb927.8.4240 results in the progressive but incomplete loss of kDNA, with only a minor effect on the tripartite attachment complex, suggesting the protein is involved in kDNA replication but not segregation. The growth phenotype of Tb927.8.4240 ablation is fully rescued in a kDNA-independent genetic background, confirming a specific role in kDNA replication.",

    "title": "Mechanistic insights into chromatin modulation by the orphan remodeler ATRX",
    "summary": "Alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked protein (ATRX) is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler that performs diverse functions, including spacing nucleosomes, facilitating the deposition of histone variant H3.3, and preventing replication stress. The mechanism by which ATRX modulates chromatin is unknown. Here, our cryo-EM structure revealed that ATRX recognizes and modulates the nucleosome through its C-terminal regions by embracing and unwrapping ~18 base-pair nucleosomal DNA near the entry/exit sites in the presence of ADP-BeF3. Strikingly, the DNA minor groove between SHL6 and SHL7 is profoundly deformed by a pin-like structure in ATRX, which uniquely intercalates the aromatic side chain of a phenylalanine into the base stackings. Biochemical assays revealed the crucial role of this phenylalanine in sliding the nucleosome without affecting the ATPase activity. Such a pin-like structure mimics a foot-step on the DNA ladder, which differentiates ATRX from other remodelers. To translocate the DNA on the nucleosome, two more features, including a disordered insertion that contacts the histone surface and a positively charged loop bridging the cross-gyre interactions, serve as essential anchors for the nucleosome modulation by ATRX. Together, we propose a climbing model for how ATRX mobilizes the DNA upon ATP hydrolysis.",

    "summary": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is essential for maintaining homeostasis in mammalian cells. Previous studies have reported more than 50 CME accessory proteins; however, the mechanism driving the invagination of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) remains elusive. We show by quantitative live cell imaging that siRNA-mediated knockdown of CCDC32, a poorly characterized endocytic accessory protein, leads to the accumulation of unstable flat clathrin assemblies. CCDC32 interacts with the \u03b1-appendage domain (AD) of AP2 in vitro and with full-length AP2 complexes in cells. Deletion of aa78-98 in CCDC32, corresponding to a predicted \u03b1-helix, abrogates AP2 binding and CCDC32\u2019s early function in CME. Furthermore, clinically observed nonsense mutations in CCDC32, which result in C-terminal truncations that lack aa78-98, are linked to the development of cardio-facio-neuro-developmental syndrome (CFNDS). Overall, our data demonstrate the function of a novel endocytic accessory protein, CCDC32, in regulating CCP stabilization and invagination, critical early stages of CME.",

This dual action leads to substantially enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield and substantially improved resistance to moisture-induced degradation. When used as a color-conversion layer on top of blue LEDs, the PS\u2013OH modified PQDs enable more efficient photon down-conversion and improved device-level performance. These results demonstrate that functionalized polymers, employed as in-situ ligands, offer a powerful approach for stabilizing and enhancing brightness of perovskite quantum dots for advanced optoelectronic applications.",

    "summary": "Light-driven hydrogen evolution is a promising strategy for solar fuel production. While numerous systems for molecular photocatalysis exist, their implementation into reusable soft materials remains challenging due to catalyst leaching, solubility issues, and limited structural integration. Here, we report the first hydrogel system in which a molecular photocatalyst is covalently embedded as crosslinker. Using a bipyridine- annulated perylene dye bearing terminal alkene groups, we employ thiol-ene click chemistry to incorporate the dye into a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based hydrogel network. Post-synthetic platinum coordination yields \u201cDyedrogels\u201d \u2013 mechanically robust hydrogels of varying shape that retain their photocatalytic functionality under visible-light irradiation in pure water, without any solubilizing additives. Structural and optical characterization confirms a homogeneous distribution of the catalyst, while indicating only negligible platinum leaching. Despite moderate hydrogen evolution turnover numbers (TON = 0.03), the stability, modularity, and reusability of this platform underscore its value as a device-like material for future flow-reactor designs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a photocatalytically active hydrogel in which the molecular catalyst itself constitutes a covalent crosslink within the polymer network.",

    "summary": "Ternary transition metal oxides (TTMOs) have emerged as a new class of electrode materials for high-performance energy storage systems, particularly supercapacitors (SCs) and hybrid battery-capacitor devices. This comprehensive review aims to comprehensively survey recent advances in the design, synthesis, and analysis of TTMOs-based nanostructures for supercapacitor (SC) electrodes. It begins by outlining the key concepts related to charge storage mechanisms in SC electrodes, electric double-layer capacitance (EDL), pseudocapacitive (PC), and battery-type (BT) behavior, followed by a clarification of device configurations, including symmetric SC (SSC), asymmetric SC (ASC), and hybrid SC (HSC) devices. This review then examines the fabrication strategies for TTMOs, emphasizing the impact of synthetic approaches on material morphology, crystallinity, and electrochemical performance. Special attention is given to the structure-property relationships that govern ion transport and charge storage dynamics in these materials. The influence of morphological features, including dimensionality, porosity, and hierarchical architecture, on electrochemical behavior is critically analyzed. A comparative evaluation of electrochemical matrices across various TTMO electrodes is presented, highlighting key performance and challenges. Ultimately, the review highlights emerging trends, current limitations, and future research directions that are poised to accelerate the development of next-generation TTMO materials for advanced energy storage technologies.",

    "title": "Tunable Gelation and Viscoelasticity of Lung-Tissue\u2013Mimetic Sealant: Linking Shear History to In Situ Mechanical Performance through Physics-Informed Machine Learning",
    "summary": "Hydrogel-based lung sealants are optimized largely based on formulation and post-cure mechanics, even though deformation history during delivery and placement plays a critical, yet under-characterized, role in determining in situ performance. This disconnect is particularly consequential on the application of lung sealants, where excessive stiffness promotes delamination while insufficient stiffness compromises airtight sealing. Here, we establish a quantitative process\u2013structure\u2013property framework for a gelatin\u2013tannic acid\u2013transglutaminase lung-mimetic sealant by integrating time-resolved rheology with physics-informed machine learning.\n\nUsing small-amplitude oscillatory shear and steady torsional flow at 37 \u00b0C, we show that gelation follows a reproducible kinetic clock (storage modulus, G\u2032\u2013 loss modulus, G\u2033, crossover at ~100 s; modulus plateau by ~600 s), while the attainable viscoelastic state is strongly governed by deformation history. Increasing oscillatory strain amplitude from 0.1 % to 50 % suppresses network maturation, reducing the post-gelation storage modulus, G\u2032,  from ~10\u2076 to ~10\u2074 Pa, whereas sustained steady shear (0.01\u20131 s\u207b\u00b9) decreases magnitude of complex viscosity by 2\u20133 orders of magnitude and permanently downshifts elastic moduli, G\u2032\u2013, from \u22483.5\u00d710\u00b3 to \u22484\u00d710\u00b2 Pa. These modulus ranges span the effective compliance of lung parenchyma under physiological tidal strain, delineating mechanical regimes associated with airtight sealing, strain accommodation, or premature interfacial failure. Controlled aeration during the processing of the sealant further decreases stiffness by ~30 % without altering gelation kinetics, providing an additional, physically interpretable compliance-tuning mechanism.\n\nTo unify these effects, we introduce a dimensionless Degree of Gelation (DoG), serving as a rheological state variable that collapses oscillatory and steady-shear histories into a single, time-resolved descriptor of network evolution. Machine-learning models trained on experimentally accessible inputs (time, strain amplitude, shear rate, frequency, aeration) accurately predict DoG (R\u00b2 \u2248 0.9) and, in inverse mode, identify handling conditions required to achieve targeted in situ mechanical states.\n\nThis rheology\u2013machine-learning framework reframes lung sealant development from a static materials optimization problem to a controllable, process-driven design strategy. By quantitatively linking applicator-level parameters to failure-relevant mechanical outcomes\u2014airtightness, compliance, and resistance to delamination\u2014it provides a mechanistic and generalizable foundation for the design of injectable hydrogels, bioadhesives, and tissue-interfacing",

    "title": "Blue amine hydrates as a novel strategy for partitioning CO2",
    "summary": "We report a novel CO2 capture and separation principle based on the unexpected formation of CO2-loaded amine hydrates. Unlike conventional amine scrubbing, which relies on energy-intensive thermal regeneration, our approach utilizes a phase change driven by cooling. We discovered that various bifunctional amines, upon capturing CO2 in aqueous solutions containing tetrahydrofuran (THF), are structurally incorporated into the hydrate crystal lattice. This phenomenon was unequivocally confirmed via solid-state NMR and FTIR spectroscopy, with some hydrates exhibiting a distinct blue coloration. This phase separation facilitates partial dehydration and the partitioning of CO2-loaded amines into the solid phase, effectively reducing the working solution\u2019s heat capacity. Scalability was successfully demonstrated in a 150-mL system under ambient pressure.

    "title": "TubercuProbe: A Cross-Attention Graph-Sequence Model for Cross-Species Chemoproteomic Discovery in Mycobacterium tuberculosis",
    "summary": "Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) and residue-specific chemoproteomics have transformed human chemical biology, yet applying these approaches to pathogens remains limited by biosafety constraints, low throughput, and the absence of reusable atlases. We present TubercuProbe, a cross-species machine learning framework that leverages large-scale human chemoproteomic knowledge to prioritize compound-protein interactions in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and other pathogens. Our model integrates a graph isomorphism network (GINE) for ligand encoding with frozen ESM-C (600M) protein embeddings via bidirectional cross-attention. Trained on >2M ChEMBL compound-protein pairs (predominantly human targets), TubercuProbe achieves R2=0.77 (MSE=0.45) for continuous affinity prediction and transfers effectively to binary cysteine reactivity prediction (CysDB AUPRC=0.63). Ablation studies reveal that pretrained features are highly transferable across freezing strategies ({triangleup}AUPRC<0.03), suggesting the model captures fundamental protein-molecule interaction patterns. As a case study, we prioritize cysteine-reactive electrophiles and molecular glues for three Mtb virulence proteins (PtpB, SapM, Rv3671c), providing candidate probes for prospective ABPP validation. Orthogonal comparison with Boltz-2 structure predictions shows moderate correlation (Pearson r{approx}0.69). TubercuProbe provides a lightweight, sequence-driven first-pass ranker that enables pre-experimental prioritization - reducing the time, cost, and experimental burden of chemoproteomic discovery in biosafety-restricted systems. We discuss extensions toward multitask learning that jointly predicts non-covalent binding and covalent reactivity, recognizing that effective covalent probes must both reach their target and react once there.",

    "summary": "Deciphering the sequence codes governing ordered peptide assemblies remains challenging due to the need to explore vast sequence space with atomic resolution. Here, we present an experimentally validated computational framework combining hybrid-resolution molecular dynamics and machine learning for the discovery of \u03b2-sheet-rich amyloid-forming peptides. Through exhaustive simulations of all 8,000 tripeptides, we demonstrate that the widely used aggregation propensity (AP) is not effective in predicting \u03b2-sheet assembly. We introduce Amyloid-Like Tendency (ALT), a metric enabled by our hybrid-resolution simulations that effectively identifies cross-\u03b2 architectures. Leveraging this physics-informed dataset, we further fine-tuned the Uni-Mol model to efficiently screen 160,000 tetrapeptides. Experimental validation of 46 candidates confirmed a predictive accuracy of ~85%, yielding 26 novel amyloid-forming peptides, including multiple hydrogelators. Mechanistic analysis reveals that specific sidechain stacking and central amino acid identity, beyond generic hydrophobicity, dictate ordered assembly. This establishes a scalable pipeline for the targeted design of functional peptide materials.",

    "title": "Diverse bacterial pattern recognition receptors sense the conserved phage proteome",
    "summary": "Recognition of foreign molecules inside cells is critical for immunity in all domains of life. Proteins of the STAND NTPase superfamily, including eukaryotic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), play a central role in this process. In bacteria and archaea, although several STAND NTPase families have been reported to sense phage proteins, their functional diversity remains largely unexplored. Here, we conducted a systematic phylogenetic analysis of prokaryotic STAND NTPases and identified at least 90 structurally distinct families associated with antiviral defense. We first show that the uncharacterized Avs7 family recognizes the major capsid protein (MCP) of tailed phages. Three cryo-EM structures of Salmonella enterica Avs7 reveal an asymmetric, butterfly-shaped tetramer that assembles stepwise via large, MCP-induced conformational changes, incorporating bacterial translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) as a scaffold that is required for full defense activity. Using highly parallel genetic screens, we further show that 13 additional STAND families sense 12 conserved phage protein folds, encompassing most of the core structural and replicative components of tailed phages. These include two structurally distinct families--Avs8 (PD-{lambda}-4) and Avs10 (Erebus/Hypnos/bNACHT64)--that also recognize MCP, as well as 11 other families (Avs11-21) that recognize the portal, portal adaptor, tail nozzle, head-tail connector, tail terminator, tail tube protein, tail assembly chaperone, tape measure protein, DNA polymerase, helicase/RecA-type ATPase, and single-stranded DNA annealing protein (SSAP), respectively. Together, our findings highlight structure-based pattern recognition and host factor repurposing as fundamental strategies of bacterial immunity.",

This study assessed the role of relA in nutritional, environmental and antimicrobial stress in Klebsiella pneumoniae, the extent of polysaccharide capsule and biofilm formation, and the pathogenic effect on Drosophila melanogaster. Two single mutants (KP03DrelA and KPPR1DrelA) obtained using the Lambda Red Recombinase Technique were the focus of analyses. We assessed environmental (ethanol, osmotic, heat) and nutritional stress (carbon, phosphate, amino acid) tolerance, capsule formation, and cell size determination in wild-type (WT) and mutant bacteria. Biofilm and agar plate susceptibility assays were performed on both starved and non-starved strains using gentamicin and ceftazidime, and stress response genes were analyzed. Drosophila melanogaster was used to examine the pathogenic effect of the presence or deletion of relA on fly survival. DrelA mutants had reduced fitness to environmental and nutritional stress compared to WT strains. Mutant strains' cell lengths were elongated and lacked a capsule versus WT and non-starved strains, and mutant strains exhibited enhanced biofilm formation or survival in the presence of ceftazidime and gentamicin. Stress response genes rpoD, phoR, phoU and pstB were absent during starvation, but rpoS was detected in C-, C+PO+ and serine hydroxamate (SHX) media; mrkA gene was not detected during starvation. Lastly, the animal model proved to be effective in showing infection levels associated with the presence of the relA gene.",

    "title": "Continued Challenges in High-Throughput Materials Predictions: MatterGen predicts compounds from the training dataset.",
    "summary": "High-throughput computational tools and generative AI models aim to revolutionise materials discovery by enabling the rapid prediction of novel inorganic compounds. However, these tools face persistent challenges with modelling compounds where multiple elements occupy the same crystallographic site, often leading to misclassification of known disordered phases as new ordered compounds. Recently, Microsoft revealed MatterGen as a tool for predicting new materials. As a proof of concept, MatterGen was used to predict the novel compound TaCr2O6, which was subsequently synthesised in a disordered form as Ta1/3Cr2/3O2. However, detailed crystallographic analysis, presented in this paper, reveals that this is not a novel compound but is identical to the already known compound Ta1/2Cr1/2O2 reported in 1972 and actually included in MatterGen\u2019s training dataset. These findings underscore the necessity of rigorous human verification in AI-assisted materials research, limiting their use for rapid and large-scale prediction of new materials. While generative models hold great promise, their effectiveness is currently limited by unresolved issues with disorder prediction and dataset validation. Improved integration with crystallographic expertise is essential to realise their full potential.",

    "summary": "Atomic-scale manipulation of chemical bond cleavage and formation offers significant advantages of extending the reaction controllability to the single-molecule regime and enabling the elucidation of fundamental reaction mechanisms. Herein, we drive reactions between two chemical species, open-shell monomeric radicals and closed-shell dimers in single-molecule junctions. Both monomers and dimers form a C-Au covalently-linked highly conducting junction in situ, with the conductance about 100 \u0301 higher than that of the dimer junction. First- principles calculations suggest that the substitution groups on the carbon in the C(sp3)-Au linkage bond effectively tunes the molecular junction conductance. Notably, captodative radicals enable the formation of weakly bonded spin-spin interactions in solution, yielding diamagnetic dimers, and we can reversibly switch between the dimer and the weakly- bonded radical pair by mechanically controlling the gap between the two electrodes.",

    "summary": "While imine (C=N) groups are renowned for their role in dynamic chemistry, whether imine binds to Au electrodes for forming single-molecule junctions and their electronic properties remain elusive. We demonstrate that imine groups work as chemical anchors for reliable formation of single-molecule junctions with gold electrodes. Scanning tunneling microscope-based break junction measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal that imine-terminated wires exhibit slightly higher conductance than amine-terminated analogs. Critically, in the presence of a nearby phenyl ring substituent, junction formation is suppressed with amine anchors but not with imines, indicating expanded molecular designs attained with imine linkers. We further find that in addition to the structures terminated with one imine and one thiomethyl linkers, dual-imine terminated molecules can also form stable molecular junctions. Our findings highlight that imines can be used as linkers with slightly reduced contact resistance than commonly used amines, offering new molecular designs for constructing molecular devices.",

    "title": "Accurate and Robust Prediction of Vertical Excitation Energies  with XYG3-Type Doubly Hybrid Density Functionals",
    "summary": "The XYG3-type doubly hybrid density functionals (xDHs) have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting ground-state energies and properties. However, until now, no method has been available to compute excited states with xDHs. In this work, we propose a method that combines the second order constricted variational density functional theory [CV(2)-DFT] within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) and the configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles correction [CIS(D)] method to predict vertical excitation energies using xDHs. This new black-box method, dubbed TDA-xDH, has been benchmarked against a collective dataset of 410 excitation energies. The results demonstrate the high accuracy and robustness of xDHs. For local valence and Rydberg excitations represented by 352 benchmark data points, XYGJ-OS achieves a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 0.08 eV, outperforming the more expensive coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) method (MAD = 0.11 eV). For 30 intramolecular charge-transfer (CT) excitations, XYGJ-OS also emerges as the best performer among tested functionals, with an MAD of 0.14 eV. Furthermore, XYGJ-OS exhibits excellent performance in predicting the 1La-1Lb gap for six linear polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), achieving an MAD of merely 0.01 eV. A case study on HAP-3MF further reveals that xDHs are able to correctly predict the inverted singlet-triplet gap. These results highlight the great promise of xDHs for accurately predicting a wide range of molecular excitation energies.",

    "summary": "Given that Mexico is one of the world's leading consumers of bottled water per capita, this study provides the first evidence of microplastic contamination across ten widely consumed commercial brands in the country. A total of 2,358 MP particles were detected with an average concentration of 39.3 \u00b1 14.6 particles/L. Statistical analysis (ANOVA, p = 0.0008) confirmed significant differences in MP levels between brands, likely attributed to variations in the production process and packaging quality. Fibers were the predominant shape of the detected MPs (72.2 %), and transparent particles were the most frequent color (57.7 %). Crucially, most detected MPs were smaller than 500 \u00b5m (80.3 %), raising toxicological concerns due to the high probability of systemic translocation in human tissues. Furthermore, FTIR spectroscopy confirmed that PET (66 %) and PP (18 %) were the dominant polymers, indicating that fragmentation and abrasion of the bottle and caps are the primary sources of MPs. The estimated intake assessment revealed that children are the most vulnerable population segment (228.2 particles/kg/year), exhibiting the highest relative MP dose normalized by body weight. Given the global evidence of adverse health effects from these polymers and their leached chemical additives, these findings underscore the urgent need to implement effective strategies to minimize MP exposure in bottled water.",

By monitoring pH, we gain simultaneous real-time insights into direct and mediated water splitting, direct and mediated dioxygen reduction, oxidation-statedependent pyridinium pKa effects, and trans-membrane OH\u2013 transport. These insights inform the development of a global regulation strategy, based on a single radical dependent dimensionless parameter, towards complete suppression of parasitic processes under practical battery cycling conditions. We also clarify the nature of the reaction between dioxygen and reduced viologen towards improved system engineering for long duration energy storage applications.",

    "summary": "Antibiotic resistance poses a critical global health threat, necessitating new strategies to address multidrug-resistant bacteria. This study presents the in silico design and evaluation of five novel benzimidazole derivatives (B1\u2013B5) as dual-action inhibitors targeting both the AcrB efflux pump and NDM-1 carbapenemase two major contributors to antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative pathogens. Computational tools, including Chemdraw, Spartan14, Chimera, Autodock Vina, and Biovia Discovery Studio, were employed for molecular modeling, docking, and visualization of key molecular interactions. All compounds satisfied Lipinski\u2019s rule of five, exhibited high predicted gastrointestinal absorption, and demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. Toxicity assessments indicated low to moderate risk, with B4 identified as the safest candidate (LD50: 3420 mg/kg). Molecular docking revealed that B1 and B5 displayed superior binding affinities to NDM-1 (-6.9 and -7.0 kcal/mol, respectively), outperforming the native ligand, while B3 and B4 matched or exceeded the native ligand\u2019s binding to AcrB (-11.1 and -11.0 kcal/mol). Detailed interaction analysis highlighted the importance of hydrogen bonds, pi-alkyl, and pi-pi stacking in stabilizing these complexes. These findings suggest that the designed benzimidazole derivatives hold promise as dual-target inhibitors, offering a potential pathway for developing new therapeutics to combat antibiotic resistance. Further experimental validation is recommended to confirm these computational results and advance these candidates toward clinical application.",

The ligand structures incorporate donor/acceptor moieties electronically decoupled by ortho connection to a bridging biphenylene group.  The M M distances observed in the crystal structures of the bimetallic complexes are shorter than the sum of the Van der Waals radii of the metal ions, suggesting stabilizing interactions between the d10 metal centers.  Additionally, short distances between the bridging biphenylene and metal atoms suggest arylene metal interactions.  Bimetallic Cu, Ag, and Au complexes of the ligand incorporating a carbazole donor and pyridyl acceptor (N2R22-) show absorption and emission energies that trend with the ionization potential of each metal, indicating metal character in the excited state. These properties contrast with our previously reported mononuclear Zn complex of N2R22-The structural and photophysical properties of five bimetallic d10 coinage metal complexes were presented.

Additionally, short distances between the bridging biphenylene and metal atoms suggest arylene metal interactions.

This suggests involvement of metal based orbitals in the excited state transitions of the bimetallic complexes, which was corroborated by molecular modeling.

Pressure-dependent Nyquist analysis shows impedance is overwhelmingly dominated by interfacial and constriction resistances, with pressure primarily reducing contact limitations rather than altering intrinsic ion transport. Temperature\u2013pressure heat maps of the high-frequency resistance reveal thermally activated transport strongly modulated by mechanical contact and electrode compatibility. These results establish pressure-resolved impedance spectroscopy as a diagnostic framework for separating intrinsic and extrinsic transport contributions in NC-based solid electrolytes.",

    "summary": "Due to their low manufacturing cost and versatility in delivering diverse nucleic acid payloads such as plasmids (pDNA) and genome editor proteins, polymers have emerged as promising vectors in gene therapy. To encapsulate and deliver anionic nucleic acids, researchers add cationic polymers to payloads (e.g., pDNA), forming\nhighly fragile, complex, and heterogeneous polyplex assemblies. Large stoichiometric excesses of protonotable amine groups (in the polymers) over the phosphate groups\n(in the pDNA) are typical of polyplexes, which are frequently formed at nitrogen-to\u0002 phosphorous ratios between 5\u2013100 . Rather than binding irreversibly to pDNA pay\u0002loads, polymers predominantly exist as \u201cfree polymers\u201d which dynamically exchange with pDNA-bound polymers. Analogous to empty lipid nanoparticles and empty viral capsids, free polymers pose complex characterization, quality control, and regulatory challenges that may hinder clinical translation. We urgently need to quantify how free polymers modify critical polyplex properties (e.g., pDNA loading per polyplex) as well as biological outcomes (e.g., immunogenicity, pDNA delivery efficiency, and toxicity). We developed a unique analytical approach that unveils hitherto unsuspected roles\nplayed by free polymers during the complexation and intracellular delivery of pDNA. Applying asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4), we gently separated free\npolymers from crude polyplexes while conserving polyplex integrity. Unlike batch light scattering analysis of   fractionated crude polyplexes, which severely  underestimate polyplex size and pDNA loading per polyplex, AF4 sharpened measurements of poly\u0002plex molecular weight, pDNA loading, and radius of gyration by removing free poly\u0002mers and their background scattering contributions. Comparing solution properties\nvia light scattering, we discovered that AF4-purified polyplexes appeared over twice as large, loading twice as much pDNA as crude polyplexes. AF4 uncovered contrasts\nin the biological performance of crude and purified polyplexes. Free polymers aggra\u0002vated inflammatory responses in macrophages by up to 22%. Removing free polymers depressed transfection efficiency by 50% while improving cell viability by 30%; reintro\u0002ducing free polymers abrogated these contrasts. By separating and quantifying free polymers in polyplexes, AF4 illuminated a far more complex portrait of polyplex so\u0002lution properties that has hitherto remained elusive to conventional characterization\nmethods. Our work has revealed pathways to ameliorate polymer-associated toxicity and inflammation during pDNA delivery.",

Here we explore the idea that balanced equations contain useable information observed by grouping and analysing similar equations, allowing us to uncover observations that support the teaching of the balancing process and aid the formalisation of algorithms or methods applicable to families of equations. Through this framework, logical relationships and proportional consistencies that define entire families of reactions are revealed. Applied to acidic redox and acid\u2013base neutralisation (ABN) systems, the concept generalises established methods (such as the oxidation-number (ON) method for certain redox systems and the ionic half-reaction/equation method for ABN reactions) and provides a foundation for deriving new methods and procedures (such as the Poly-Var Algorithm for the core ABN reaction). PIA therefore offers a conceptual lens for analysing balanced equations distinct from existing generalised approaches.

    "title": "Multiscale modelling of the electrocatalysis of enzymes: Insights into the performance of microperoxidase at an aqueous/graphene interface and their exploitation to improve performance",
    "summary": "There is great interest in systems where enzymes are adsorbed on and act at electrode surfaces \u2013 enzymatic biofuel cells, bioreactors and biosensors are just three examples. Whilst such systems have been the subject of extensive study and development since the 1960s, the rate of progress in this research is hindered by a lack of molecular-level understanding of the enzyme adsorption process and adsorbed states, and the associated electron transfer processes. Herein, we present and then demonstrate a multiscale approach that combines molecular dynamics simulation to elucidate the former and density functional theory (MD/DFT) for the latter. The demonstration of the new approach focused on a system involving the microperoxidase-11 (MP-11) enzyme, a microenzyme made up of a Fe-containing heme ring attached to an 11-residue scaffold, a graphene electrode, and a neutral-pH saline solution. For this system, the adsorbed MP-11 was found to adopt six possible heme configurations, where the configurations are defined by the distance of the iron from the graphene and the angle between the normals of the heme ring and graphene electrode. The rate constant for electron transfer between the MP-11 and graphene evaluated through combining the MD and DFT results and their variation with overpotential are comparable to the limited experimental data.  The results were used to illustrate how the new multiscale approach could be used to improve electrocatalytic performance of the system.",

    "title": "Photocatalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide Over Silver-Modified Lanthanide Titanate Under Photoirradiation Exceeding 300 nm",
    "summary": "The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals is a promising approach for artificial photosynthesis. The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 over Ag-modified lanthanide titanates (Ln2Ti2O7) was investigated in this study under photoirradiation with wavelengths longer than 300 nm using 2-propanol as a hole scavenger. Among the various Ln2Ti2O7 materials tested, La2Ti2O7 exhibited superior photocatalytic performance. The activity was strongly dependent on the crystallinity and surface area of the La2Ti2O7 host, with the optimal sample obtained by calcination at 1423 K for 2 h. Furthermore, the Ag cocatalyst loading method significantly affected the CO production rate. Chemical reduction facilitated the formation of highly dispersed, small metallic Ag nanoparticles (2\u201310 nm), which were essential for efficient CO2 reduction. In contrast, the photodeposition and impregnation methods resulted in the formation of larger, aggregated Ag particles (20\u201350 nm), leading to lower photocatalytic activity. The optimised Ag/La2Ti2O7 photocatalyst achieved a CO formation rate of approximately 120 \u00b5mol h\u22121 with high selectivity (>90%). The stoichiometric formation of acetone and isotopic labelling experiments using 13CO2 confirmed that the reaction proceeded via the reduction of CO2 to CO, coupled with the oxidation of 2-propanol.",

    "title": "Kinetic insights into cholera toxin B-biomimetic glycan interactions",
    "summary": "Enterotoxins cause severe diseases worldwide, exacerbated by limited access to clean water, food, and medical care. Cholera is a diarrheal disease driven by cholera enterotoxin (CTX) and is secreted by Vibrio cholerae in the small intestinal (SI) epithelium. CTX consists of an enzymatic A subunit (CTA) and a pentameric B subunit (CTB), which mediates cellular uptake by binding to glycans. While CTB primarily recognizes GM1 glycosphingolipid or galactose ligands, GM1 is undetectable in the human SI, and fucose ligands are a key alternative binding target. Previously, we developed linear norbornenyl glycopolymers as biomimetic inhibitors that block CTB binding through interchain crosslinking, forming CTB-glycopolymer aggregates. To assess the polymers\u2019 potential efficacy under flow conditions, we evaluated CTB-glycopolymer binding kinetics under dynamic conditions using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Copolymer with a random display of galactose and fucose (pGal50Fuc50) showed nanomolar avidity with stable complex formation driven primarily by a slow dissociation rate in the multivalent phase (kd1). In contrast, an equimolar mixture of homopolymers (pGal100 + pFuc100) exhibited similar binding avidity and comparable inhibitory efficacy but did not display slow-dissociation. Moreover, random copolymer pGal25Fuc75 dissociated slowly even from low-CTB-density surfaces. These results highlight the superior stability of copolymers in forming CTB\u2013copolymer aggregates under low CTB abundance and flow conditions. These findings underscore the importance of co-displaying galactose and fucose for complex formation and for developing clinically-useful therapies.",

    "title": "Aqueous Dispersion of Carbon Nanotubes by Chlorine Dioxide Oxidation",
    "summary": "The poor solubility and dispersibility of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in aqueous media remain critical limitations for their practical application because conventional oxidative treatments typically require harsh conditions that degrade the nanotube structure. Here, we report a simple and scalable method for dispersing SWCNTs in water via chlorine dioxide (ClO\u2082\u2022)-mediated oxidation under ambient conditions. The treatment selectively introduced oxygenated functionalities\u2014including hydroxy, carbonyl, and carboxy groups\u2014onto the CNT surface while preserving the tubular framework, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The resulting dispersions exhibited long-term colloidal stability without the need for surfactants, supported by a strongly negative \u03b6 potential (\u221241.6 mV). Importantly, electronic conductivity was largely maintained: the resistivity of oxidized CNT films was only threefold higher than that of sodium cholate\u2013dispersed CNTs (0.045 vs 0.016 \u03a9\u00b7cm at 25 \u00b0C), with <10% variation between 25 and 50 \u00b0C. This unique balance between enhanced aqueous dispersibility and preserved charge transport underscores ClO\u2082\u2022 oxidation as a green and effective strategy for producing water-processable CNTs, showing promise for applications in pharmaceutical drugs, printable electronics, functional composites, energy storage, and sensing.",

    "title": "Beyond Deep Learning Dominance: A Scaffold-Aware Hybrid Framework for Robust Toxicity Prediction in Data-Scarce Regimes",
    "summary": "Computational toxicology plays a pivotal role in modern drug discovery and environmental risk assessment; however, the reliability of predictive models on unseen chemical scaffolds remains a critical bottleneck. Deep learning architectures, despite their prevalence, are susceptible to \u2019silent failures\u2019\u2014yielding high-confidence errors on out-of-distribution data\u2014which poses significant risks in safety-critical applications. In this study, we propose a \u2019Safe-byDesign\u2019 hybrid framework to mitigate this epistemic uncertainty. Rather than relying on a single algorithmic paradigm, we integrate the explicit structural \u2019memory\u2019 of classical Random Forests with the topological \u2019intuition\u2019 of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) via a transparent Stacking Ensemble (Logistic Regression) functioning as a Mixture of Experts (MoE). Evaluated across 12 Tox21 endpoints using a rigorous 5-seed benchmarking protocol under Nested Scaffold Split, our analysis demonstrates that classical models serve as an essential robustness layer in data-scarce regimes. Crucially, the Hybrid MoE functions as a fail-safe mechanism, preventing performance degradation in tasks where pure GNNs struggle to generalize (e.g., NR-AR-LBD), while leveraging complementary strengths in others (e.g., SR-MMP). Benchmarking against the industry-standard DeepChem GraphConv model reveals statistical equivalence (p > 0.05) in overall performance, with the Hybrid framework exhibiting superior predictive stability in 7 out of 12 assays, particularly in complex endpoints such as SR-p53 and Androgen Receptor targets. These findings suggest that the proposed architecture offers a viable pathway toward achieving state-of-the-art predictive power without compromising the interpretability required for regulatory acceptance.",

    "title": "Redox Robust Mn(I/0/-I) Dicarbenes: Electrochemistry, Steric Mapping, and Borate-Directed C-C Bond Formation",
    "summary": "Manganese is perhaps the most electronically versatile element, accessing eleven different formal oxidation states (-3 to +7). However, the redox properties and reactivities of low valent monometallic Mn(0) and Mn(-I) systems remain severely underexplored due to the propensity of Mn0 to dimerize and quench high-energy metalloradicals. We report a new series of redox active monometallic Mn(I), Mn(0) and Mn(-I) complexes containing a BH2-bridged dicarbene ligand coordinated to Mn, all which have been characterized using a suite of experimental and cutting-edge computational (DFT) methods. Slow electron transfer kinetics at Mn(I/0) are observed, with computations and electrochemical simulations in excellent agreement with experiment. Despite the lack of steric bulk at the BH2-bridged Mn(0), the tBu groups at the dicarbene provide sufficient steric protection to prevent dimerization, with percent buried volume (%V_bur) serving as a steric ranking tool for to predict whether Mn(0) complexes will remain monometallic in solution. We show that when %V_bur > 83% prevents dimerization for a diverse array of of Mn(0) complexes from the literature. Ligand sterics of the BPh2-bridged and BH2 bridged complexes dictate reaction outcomes when Mn(I) and Mn(-I) are exposed to nucleophiles and electrophiles, respectively, while the Mn(0) metalloradicals facilitate radical cycloisomerization catalysis of 6-iodo-1-hexene at room temperature. This work underscores the importance of ligand sterics in rationalizing reactivity patterns at Mn and offers valuable insights for designing chelating ligands that can selectively leverage  Mn(I/0/-I) states in redox-mediated reactions.",

    "title": "Heteroatom-Engineered Covalent Organic Frameworks Break the CO2 Separation Trade-Off in Mixed Matrix Membranes",
    "summary": "Breaking the long-standing permeability\u2013selectivity trade-off remains a central challenge in membrane-based carbon dioxide separations. Here we report a heteroatom-engineering strategy that leverages structurally precise covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to transcend this limitation in mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). Two isostructural, \u03c0-conjugated two-dimensional COFs, TUS-621 and TUS-622, were rationally designed through symmetry-guided reticulation of a hexatopic triphenylene node with oxygen- and sulfur-containing diamine linkers, respectively, enabling systematic modulation of pore surface chemistry without altering topology. When incorporated into a Pebax polymer matrix, these COFs function as CO2-philic, molecularly defined transport domains that synergistically couple preferential CO2 sorption with ordered and fast diffusion channels. The optimized TUS-621/Pebax-10% membrane exhibits a CO2 permeability of 433 Barrer with a CO2/CH4 selectivity of 55.3 under mixed-gas conditions, decisively surpassing the 2008 Robeson upper bound for CO2/CH4 separation, while simultaneously achieving high CO2/H2 separation performance (CO2 permeability of 407 Barrer and selectivity of 25.2). Comprehensive pressure- and temperature-dependent permeation studies reveal that selectivity remains remarkably stable over 2\u201310 bar and 25\u2013100 \u00b0C, underscoring the robustness of the COF-enabled transport pathways. Long-term operation over 30 days shows negligible performance decay, highlighting excellent resistance to physical aging and interfacial degradation. Comparative analysis establishes that oxygen-rich pore environments in TUS-621 impart stronger CO2 affinity and higher accessible surface area than the sulfur-containing analogue, directly translating molecular-level design into macroscopic separation performance. This work demonstrates that heteroatom-engineered COFs provide a powerful platform for overcoming fundamental transport trade-offs and advancing MMMs toward practical, high-efficiency CO2 separations.",

    "summary": "Cellulose-based fluorescent materials enjoy advantages such as excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and environmental friendliness, making them potentially useful for chemical sensing, bioimaging, and information encryption. However, traditional cellulose-based fluorescent materials face issues of single functionality and aggregation-caused quenching, making the development of multifunctional fluorescent cellulose materials applicable in aggregated states desirable but challenging. Herein, we innovatively endowed fluorescent cellulose materials with an aggregation-induced emission characteristic through hydroxyl-yne click reaction. The developed ECTPEs exhibit breakthrough performance with high transparency (>95%), full ultraviolet (UV)-shielding efficiency (>99.9%), accompanied by fluorescence characteristics, thereby achieving simultaneous UV blocking and indicating functions for UV-sensitive materials. Additionally, ECTPEs demonstrate grafting ratio-dependent multicolor fluorescence, enabling their application in high-resolution fluorescent QR codes. The further development of acid-responsive ECTPE-MTPAPs through secondary grafting realizes fluorescence color switching under acidic stimulation and enables the creation of dynamic multicolor coding devices with enhanced data storage density and sophisticated encryption capabilities. Significantly, an amine exchange strategy based on dynamic enol ether bonds effectively resolves the inherent conflict between material functionalization and degradability. This work provides an innovative methodology for developing reversible multifunctional fluorescent cellulose materials, offering crucial guidance for advancing the development of sustainable fluorescent materials.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00354v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) are filamentary moisture pathways responsible for a large fraction of extreme precipitation and often occur as interacting filament bundles within the same synoptic regime. Existing diagnostics typically analyze ARs in isolation, despite the frequent coexistence and interaction of multiple filaments. We introduce a topological framework for AR analysis based on framed braids and framed braidoids, which encodes both the geometric interaction of AR centroids and the internal evolution of moisture transport.\n  In this approach, AR filaments are represented as strands whose time-ordered crossings form braid words, while moisture-based framing captures internal intensification or weakening along each filament. Applying this framework to reanalysis-derived Atmospheric River track data, we construct braid and framed braid representations over sliding time windows and analyze a strongly interacting multi-filament AR episode in the North Pacific. The results show that braid-based indicators capture structural reorganizations and moisture intensification episodes that are not apparent from centroid geometry or IVT magnitude alone, offering a complementary structural perspective on atmospheric moisture transport.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00062v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We study a periodically driven macrospin system with anisotropic long-range interactions and collective dissipation, described by a Lindblad master equation. In the thermodynamic limit ($N\\to\\infty$), a mean-field treatment yields classical equations of motion, whose dynamics are characterized via the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE). Focusing on the thermodynamic limit, we map out chaotic, quasiperiodic, and periodic phases via bifurcation diagrams, MLEs, and Fourier spectra of evolved observables, identifying classic period-doubling bifurcations and fractal boundaries in the regions of attractors. Finite-size quantum simulations in the Dicke basis reveal that while both quantum and classical systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases, finite-size effects suppress some behaviors present in the thermodynamic limit. The sign of $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}}$ serves as a key indicator of convergence between quantum and classical dynamics, which agree over timescales up to the Lyapunov time. Analysis of the density matrix shows that convergence occurs only when its nonzero elements are sharply localized. However, the nonconvergence does not imply a fundamental difference between quantum and classical dynamics: in chaotic regimes, although the evolution orbits of quantum and classical systems show significant differences, quantum evolution becomes mixed and diffusively explores the Hilbert space, signaling quantum chaos, which can be confirmed by the delocalized nature of the density matrix.",

By systematically varying particle geometry -- from spheres to strongly non-convex polypods -- as well as frictional properties and the number of branches, we explore how these parameters, together with the preparation protocol, shape the internal structure of the system. Using X-ray tomography combined with a dedicated image-analysis pipeline, we accurately extract the position, orientation, and contacts of every particle in each pile. This allows us to quantify the evolution of key structural observables as a function of particle geometry and preparation method. In particular, we measure the distributions of local packing fraction, coordination number, number of neighbors, and contact locations, along with particle-particle positional and orientational correlations. More importantly, we construct a new stability indicator that correlates perfectly with the observed pile stabilities, enabling us to identify the fundamental mechanisms responsible for \\textit{geometrically induced cohesion} in granular systems composed of non-interlocking particle shapes: interdigitation, rotational constraint, friction-mediated cohesion, and the ability of a pile to re-stabilize.",

    "title": "Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy without a matrix",
    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00102v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) is a highly effective optimization technique. A primary challenge when applying CMA-ES in high dimensionality is sampling from a multivariate normal distribution with an arbitrary covariance matrix, which involves its decomposition. The cubic complexity of this process is the main obstacle to applying CMA-ES in highdimensional spaces. We introduce a version of CMA-ES that uses no covariance matrix at all. In the proposed matrix-free CMA-ES, an archive stores the vectors of differences between individuals and the midpoint, normalized by the step size. New individuals are generated as the weighted combinations of the vectors from the archive. We prove that the probability distribution of individuals generated by the proposed method is identical to that of the standard CMA-ES. Experimental results show that reducing the archive size to store only a fixed number of the most recent populations is sufficient, without compromising optimization efficiency. The matrix-free and matrix-based CMA-ES achieve comparable results on the quadratic function when the step-size adaptation is turned off. When coupled with the step-size adaptation method, the matrix-free CMA-ES converges faster than the matrix-based, and usually yields the results of a comparable or superior quality, according to the results obtained for the CEC'2017 benchmark suite. Presented approach simplifies the algorithm, offers a novel perspective on covariance matrix adaptation, and serves as a stepping stone toward even more efficient methods.",

We incorporate stably stratified regions with convective mixing and, for the first time, ab initio results on the phase separation of silicate-hydrogen mixtures to model silicate rain in sub-Neptune envelopes. We demonstrate that inefficient mantle cooling can retain sufficient heat to Gyr ages: inefficient heat transport from mantle to envelope alone keeps radii $\\sim$10\\% larger than predicted by adiabatic models at late times. Silicate rain can contribute an additional $\\sim$5\\% to the radius, depending on envelope mass and initial metal abundance. The silicate-hydrogen immiscibility region may lie in the middle or even upper envelope, far above the envelope-mantle boundary layer, and bifurcates the envelope into two an upper, hydrogen-rich region and a lower, metal-rich region above the mantle. If silicate rain occurs, atmospheres should appear depleted of silicates while radii remain inflated at late ages. To demonstrate this, we present interior evolution models for GJ 1214 b, K2-18 b, TOI-270 d, and TOI-1801 b, showing that hot, liquid silicate mantles with thin envelopes reproduce their radii and mean densities, providing an alternative to water-world interpretations. These results imply that bulk compositions inferred from mean density must account for mantle thermal state and envelope mixing/phase separation history; such thermal ``memories'' may constrain formation entropies and temperatures when metallicities are better measured.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.11930v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Mechanical lattices support topological wave phenomena governed by geometric phases. We develop a compact Hilbert space description for one-dimensional elastic chains, expressing intra-cell motion as a normalized superposition of orthogonal eigenstates and tracking complex amplitudes as trajectories on a Bloch sphere. For diatomic lattices, this framework makes inversion symmetry protection explicit: the relative phase between in-phase and out-of-phase modes is piecewise locked, and the Zak phase is quantized with band-dependent jumps at symmetry points. Extending the analysis to triatomic lattices shows that restoring inversion retains quantization, whereas breaking it dequantizes the geometric phase while leaving the spectral origin invariant. Viewing norm-preserving transformations of the modal coefficient pair as Bloch sphere rotations, we demonstrate classical analogues of single-qubit logic gates. A pi-phase rotation about a transverse axis swaps the modal poles, and a longitudinal-axis phase flip maps balanced superpositions to their conjugates. These gate-like operations are realized by controlled evolution across wavenumber space and can be driven or reprogrammed through spatiotemporal stiffness modulation. Introducing space-time modulation hybridizes carrier and sideband harmonics, producing continuous phase winding and open-path geometric phases accumulated along the Floquet trajectory. Across static and modulated regimes, the framework unifies algebraic and geometric viewpoints, remains robust to gauge and basis choices, and operates directly on amplitude-phase data. The results clarify how symmetry, modulation, and topology jointly govern dispersion, modal mixing, and phase accumulation, providing tools to analyze and design vibration and acoustic functionalities in engineered structures.",

Cultural learning and creativity is modelled as coherence-seeking information processing: individuals filter, transform and recombine input in light of prior acquisitions and dissonance reduction, thereby creating increasingly structured worldviews. Higher-order traits such as goals, skills, norms and cognitive gadgets act as emergent metafilters that regulate subsequent selection by defining what counts as coherent. Together, these filtering processes self-organise into epistemic niches, echo chambers, polarised groups and institutions that channel information flows and constrain future evolution. In this view, LLMs and recommender algorithms are products of cultural embeddings that now act back on cultural systems by automated filtering and recombination of information, reshaping future dynamics of cultural systems.",

Its orbital eccentricity is a critical parameter for testing mechanisms such as tidal heating and high-eccentricity migration, yet previous measurements have remained inconclusive. Due to the large radial velocity jitter caused by stellar activity, and the presence of at least one additional planet in the system, previous radial velocity measurements could not robustly determine the eccentricity of WASP-107~b. Here we combine the new JWST secondary eclipse data with transit timing data from HST, TESS, and JWST to measure the eccentricity of WASP-107~b. Our joint analysis shows that WASP-107~b has an eccentricity of $0.09\\pm0.02$, a mass of $0.096\\pm0.005 \\, M_J$, and an orbital period of $5.721487\\pm0.000001$~days. We find the $99.7\\%$ lower limit of the eccentricity is about 0.04. These new measurements are consistent with the scenario in which WASP-107~b is in the final stage of high-eccentricity migration. Preliminary estimate shows that eccentricity-driven tidal dissipation can provide a significant contribution to the energy required to sustain the observed radius inflation of WASP-107~b. Our results establish the dynamical status of one of the most intriguing low-density exoplanets known, and offer new insights into its formation and evolution history.",

Through a chronological review of 3GPP Releases 15 to 19, we highlight the progression of UE functionalities from basic channel state information (CSI) reporting to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based CSI enhancement and UE-initiated beam management. We further examine key implementation challenges, including multi-panel UE (MPUE) architectures, on-device intelligent processing, and energy-efficient operation, and then discuss corresponding architectural innovations under practical constraints. Using digital-twin-based evaluations, we validate the impact of emerging UE-centric functionalities, illustrating that UE-initiated beam reporting improves throughput in realistic mobility scenarios, while a multi-panel architecture enhances link robustness compared with a single-panel UE.",

    "title": "Geometric Complexity of Quantum Channels via Unitary Dilations",
    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00735v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Nielsen's geometric approach to quantum circuit complexity provides a Riemannian framework for quantifying the cost of implementing unitary (closed--system) dynamics. For open dynamics, however, the reduced evolution is described by quantum channels and admits many inequivalent Stinespring realizations, so any meaningful complexity notion must specify which microscopic resources are counted as accessible and which transformations are regarded as gauge. We introduce and analyze a geometric complexity functional for families of quantum channels based on unitary dilations. We distinguish an implementation-dependent complexity, defined relative to explicit dilation data, from an intrinsic channel complexity obtained by minimizing over a physically motivated class of admissible dilations (e.g. bounded environment dimension, energy or norm constraints, and penalty structures). The functional has a subtractive form: it compares the geometric cost of the total unitary realization with a canonical surrogate term that removes purely environmental contributions. We justify this subtraction from concise postulates, including closed-system consistency, environment-only neutrality, and invariance under dilation gauge transformations that leave the channel unchanged. This leads to a companion quantity, noise complexity, quantifying the loss of geometric complexity relative to a prescribed ideal closed evolution. We establish a coherence-based lower bound for unitary geometric complexity, derive structural properties such as linear time scaling under time-homogeneous dilations, and obtain dissipator--controlled bounds in the Markovian (GKSL/Lindblad) regime under a standard dilation construction. Finally, we illustrate the framework on canonical benchmark noise models, including dephasing, amplitude damping, and depolarizing (Pauli) channels.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00172v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Forecasting high-dimensional spatiotemporal systems remains computationally challenging for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models due to gradient-based training and memory bottlenecks. Reservoir Computing (RC) mitigates these challenges by replacing backpropagation with fixed recurrent layers and a convex readout optimization, yet conventional RC architectures still scale poorly with input dimensionality. We introduce a Sequential Reservoir Computing (Sequential RC) architecture that decomposes a large reservoir into a series of smaller, interconnected reservoirs. This design reduces memory and computational costs while preserving long-term temporal dependencies. Using both low-dimensional chaotic systems (Lorenz63) and high-dimensional physical simulations (2D vorticity and shallow-water equations), Sequential RC achieves 15-25% longer valid forecast horizons, 20-30% lower error metrics (SSIM, RMSE), and up to three orders of magnitude lower training cost compared to LSTM and standard RNN baselines. The results demonstrate that Sequential RC maintains the simplicity and efficiency of conventional RC while achieving superior scalability for high-dimensional dynamical systems. This approach provides a practical path toward real-time, energy-efficient forecasting in scientific and engineering applications.",

    "title": "Evolutionary Optimization of Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Advancing Generalizability by the Baldwin Effect",
    "summary": "arXiv:2312.03243v4 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are at the forefront of scientific machine learning, making possible the creation of machine intelligence that is cognizant of physical laws and able to accurately simulate them. However, today's PINNs are often trained for a single physics task and require computationally expensive re-training for each new task, even for tasks from similar physics domains. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a pioneering approach to advance the generalizability of PINNs through the framework of Baldwinian evolution. Drawing inspiration from the neurodevelopment of precocial species that have evolved to learn, predict and react quickly to their environment, we envision PINNs that are pre-wired with connection strengths inducing strong biases towards efficient learning of physics. A novel two-stage stochastic programming formulation coupling evolutionary selection pressure (based on proficiency over a distribution of physics tasks) with lifetime learning (to specialize on a sampled subset of those tasks) is proposed to instantiate the Baldwin effect. The evolved Baldwinian-PINNs demonstrate fast and physics-compliant prediction capabilities across a range of empirically challenging problem instances with more than an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy at a fraction of the computation cost compared to state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning methods. For example, when solving the diffusion-reaction equation, a 70x improvement in accuracy was obtained while taking 700x less computational time. This paper thus marks a leap forward in the meta-learning of PINNs as generalizable physics solvers. Sample codes are available at https://github.com/chiuph/Baldwinian-PINN.",

This volume-limited sample is part of the RKSTAR survey of $\\sim$4400 K dwarf primaries within 50 pc. Using Empirical SpecMatch and the diagnostic lines H-alpha (6562.8 Angstrom) and Li I (6707.8 Angstrom), we derive stellar properties, activity status, and age indicators calibrated against 35 benchmark K dwarfs with ages from 20 Myr to 5 Gyr. We find that 7.4% (43 stars) exhibit signatures of youth and/or chromospheric activity: 19 stars show lithium absorption indicating ages $<$1 Gyr, and 36 display H$\\alpha$ emission. Kinematic analysis using BANYAN $\\Sigma$ identifies 8 additional young stars through membership in the AB Doradus moving group and the Hyades cluster, bringing the total young/active population to 8.8% (51 stars). Stellar parameters span 3600--5500 K in \\teff, $-$0.60 to $+$0.55 dex in [Fe/H], and $<$10 to $>$25 km s$^{-1}$ in $v\\sin i$.

Young and active stars are predominantly thin disk members, with two thick disk exceptions. Cross-matching with NASA's Exoplanet Archive reveals only 7.5% (44 stars) host confirmed planets as of July 2025. Our results identify 529 mature, inactive K dwarfs as prime targets for terrestrial planet searches, providing a crucial resource for exoplanet habitability studies in the solar neighborhood.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2508.21755v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: This work presents an analysis of semantic communication in the context of First-Order Logic (FOL)-based deduction. Specifically, the receiver holds a set of hypotheses about the State of the World (SotW), while the transmitter has incomplete evidence about the true SotW but lacks access to the ground truth. The transmitter aims to communicate limited information to help the receiver identify the hypothesis most consistent with true SotW. We formulate the objective as approximating the posterior distribution of the transmitter at the receiver. Using Stirling's approximation, this reduces to a constrained, finite-horizon resource allocation problem. Applying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions yields a truncated water-filling solution. Despite the problem's non-convexity, symmetry and permutation invariance ensure global optimality. Based on this, we design message selection strategies, both for single- and multi- round communication, and model the receiver's inference as an $m$-ary Bayesian hypothesis testing problem. Under the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) rule, our communication strategy achieves optimal performance within budget constraints. We further analyze convergence rates and validate the theoretical findings through experiments, demonstrating reduced error over random selection and prior methods.",

We present a consistent derivation of reaction-diffusion equations from systems of suitably rescaled kinetic Boltzmann equations for distribution functions of cell populations interacting in a host medium. We show at first that the classical diffusive limit of kinetic equations leads to linear diffusion terms only. Then, we show possible strategies in order to obtain, from the kinetic level, macroscopic systems with nonlinear diffusion and also with cross-diffusion effects. The derivation from a kinetic description has the advantage of relating reaction and diffusion coefficients to the microscopic parameters of the interactions. We present an application of our approach to the study of the evolution of different bacterial populations on a leaf surface.

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00515v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Assembly theory (AT) introduces a concept of causation as a material property, constitutive of a metrology of evolution and selection. The physical scale for causation is quantified with the assembly index, defined as the minimum number of steps necessary for a distinguishable object to exist, where steps are assembled recursively. Observing countable copies of high assembly index objects indicates that a mechanism to produce them is persistent, such that the object's environment builds a memory that traps causation within a contingent chain. Copy number and assembly index underlie the standardized metrology for detecting causation (assembly index), and evidence of contingency (copy number). Together, these allow the precise definition of a selective threshold in assembly space, understood as the set of all causal possibilities. This threshold demarcates life (and its derivative agential, intelligent and technological forms) as structures with persistent copies beyond the threshold. In introducing a fundamental concept of material causation to explain and measure life, AT represents a departure from prior theories of causation, such as interventional ones, which have so far proven incompatible with fundamental physics. We discuss how AT's concept of causation provides the foundation for a theory of physics where novelty, contingency and the potential for open-endedness are fundamental, and determinism is emergent along assembled lineages.",

    "title": "High-Temperature Deformation Behavior of Co-Free Non-Equiatomic CrMnFeNi Alloy",
    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00619v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Cobalt-free high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have garnered interest for nuclear structural applications due to their good mechanical performance, thermal stability, and resistance to radiation-induced degradation, while avoiding long-lived Co radioisotopes. This study presents an experimental and computational investigation of the plastic deformation behavior of a non-equatomic CrMnFeNi alloy, designed to maintain a stability of fcc phase in a large domain of temperatures and to balance stacking fault (SF) energies for enhanced strain hardening and ductility. Tensile tests reveal a temperature-dependent reduction in mechanical strength, attributed to thermally activated deformation mechanisms and microstructural evolution. Molecular dynamics simulations of single- and polycrystals capture dislocation activity, SF formation, and twin nucleation as a function of strain and temperature. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) confirms twin formation and grain boundary activity. The Schmid factor mapping is drawn to interpret local slip activity and anisotropic deformation behavior. The absence of Co leads to enhanced high-temperature strength compared to the Cantor alloy.",

Building on the recently introduced ESP framework, this work focuses on rigorous and thermodynamically consistent pressure/stress evaluation in the isothermal--isobaric ensemble. ESP employs prolate spheroidal wave functions as both splitting and spreading kernels, reducing the Fourier grid size needed to reach a prescribed pressure accuracy compared with current widely used mesh-Ewald methods based on Gaussian splitting and B-spline spreading. We derive a unified pressure-tensor formulation applicable to isotropic, semi-isotropic, anisotropic, and fully flexible cells, and show that the long-range pressure can be evaluated with a single forward FFT followed by diagonal scaling, whereas force evaluation requires both forward and inverse transforms. We provide production implementations in LAMMPS and GROMACS and validate pressure and force accuracy on bulk water, LiTFSI ionic liquids, and a transmembrane system. Benchmarks on up to $3\\times 10^3$ CPU cores demonstrate strong scaling and reduced communication cost at matched accuracy, particularly for NPT pressure evaluation.",

To address this gap, we develop an extended SIRS model that distinguishes infections with the original strain and a mutant strain, and explicitly introduces a vaccinated compartment state. At the behavioral level, we employ evolutionary game theory to model individual vaccination decisions, where strategies are determined by both neighbors' choices and the current epidemiological situation. This process corresponds to the time-varying vaccination rate of susceptible individuals transitioning to vaccinated individuals at the epidemic spreading level. We then couple the epidemic and vaccination behavioral processes through the microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA) and finally investigate the evolutionary dynamics via numerical simulations. The results show that our framework can effectively mitigate outbreaks across different disease scenarios. Sensitivity analysis further reveals that vaccination uptake is most strongly influenced by vaccine cost, efficacy, and perceived risk of side effects. Overall, this behavior-aware modeling framework captures the co-evolution of viral mutation and vaccination behavior, providing quantitative and theoretical support for designing effective public health vaccination policies.",

These expressions can provide more solid physical basis for understanding 2-dimensional electronic spectroscopy signals. For more general cases of system-bath coupling, the quantum master equation (QME) approach is employed for the derivation of multistep time evolution equations for Green function-like operators. Solution of these equations is feasible at the level of 2nd order non-Markovian QME, and the new approach can account for inter-exciton coupling, dephasing, relaxation, and non-Markovian effects in a consistent manner.",

Populations evolve over time according to a piecewise linear system of ordinary differential equations subject to a non-negativity constraint resulting in discrete time extinction and revival events. The dynamics are generated by a random elliptic community matrix with tunable correlation strength. We show that, independent of the correlation strength, solutions of the system are confined to subsets of the phase space that can be cast as time-varying Gardner volumes from the theory of learning in neural networks. These volumes decrease with the diversity (i.e. the fraction of extant species) and become exponentially small in the long-time limit. Using standard results from random matrix theory, the changing diversity is then linked to a sequence of contractions and expansions in the spectrum of the community matrix over time, resulting in a sequence of May-type stability problems determining whether the total population evolves toward complete extinction or unbounded growth. In the case of unbounded growth, we show the model allows for a particularly simple nonlinear extension in which the solutions instead evolve towards a new attractor.",

In this work, we introduce a family of improved information-theoretic measures of emergence that iteratively correct for double-counted terms. Our approach is computationally efficient and provides a controllable trade-off between computational load and sensitivity, leading to more accurate and versatile estimates of emergence.

We show that, with precise adaptive optimization of drug delivery, it is possible to significantly prolong the cancer suppression period, potentially converting metastatic prostate cancer from a terminal disease to a chronic disease for most patients, as supported by clinical and analytical evidence. We suggest that clinicians might explore the possibility of implementing a high-level tight control (HLTC) treatment, in which the trigger signals (i.e. biomarker levels) for drug administration and cessation are both high and close together, typically yield the best outcomes, as demonstrated through both computation and theoretical analysis. This simple insight could serve as a valuable guide for improving current adaptive chemotherapy treatments in other hormone-sensitive cancers.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00178v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Synchronization control in networked dynamical systems requires regulating not only whether coherence is achieved, but also when and to what extent it emerges. We propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for continuous-time synchronization regulation, in which system trajectories and control inputs are jointly parameterized and constrained by the governing dynamics. Macroscopic synchronization objectives are imposed directly at the trajectory level by enforcing persistence conditions on the order parameter after a prescribed target time. This formulation enables simultaneous control of synchronization time and coherence level without assuming any explicit feedback law or solving a strict optimal control problem. Numerical studies on networked Kuramoto oscillators demonstrate smooth synchronization with reduced transient control effort and competitive cumulative cost relative to analytical baselines. The framework remains effective in non-gradient and frustrated dynamics, highlighting physics-informed neural control as a flexible trajectory-level approach to synchronization regulation.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00149v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Given a 4D symplectic map $F_0$ that has a normally hyperbolic invariant cylinder foliated by invariant tori, those with rational rotation numbers are themselves foliated by subharmonic periodic orbits (SPOs). If $F_0$ is part of a perturbative family $F_\\varepsilon$, one is often interested in computing those SPOs which persist for $\\varepsilon >0$. Assuming that a persisting SPO of $F_0$ has been identified, in this paper, we develop a quasi-Newton method which solves for the SPO simultaneously with its Floquet vectors and multipliers. This in turn enables continuation by the perturbation parameter $\\varepsilon$. The resulting SPO and Floquet vectors are then used to compute Taylor parameterizations of the SPO's weak stable and unstable manifolds, if they exist. Our quasi-Newton method is based on an adaptation of the parameterization method for invariant tori, with this paper being the first-ever to apply such a framework to directly compute periodic orbit points themselves. The new algorithm improves on efficiency compared to prior multi-shooting methods for SPOs, and notably applies to the case of stroboscopic maps of 2.5 DOF Hamiltonian flows resulting from periodic perturbations of 2 DOF systems. The tools have been successfully used for studies of resonant orbits in perturbed real-life celestial systems, the results of which are summarized as a demonstration of the methods' utility.",

A critical feature of this setting is the \"zero-mode singularity,\" where the Laplacian operator possesses a trivial zero eigenvalue ($\\lambda_0=0$), providing no linear dissipation for the spatial mean. We rigorously prove the global well-posedness of the system and the existence of a compact global attractor $\\mathcal{A}$ in the phase space $\\mathbb{H}=(L^2(\\Omega))^N$. Utilizing the Moser-Alikakos iteration technique, we establish uniform $L^\\infty(\\Omega)$ bounds, overcoming the lack of Sobolev embedding from $H^1$ into $L^\\infty$ in three dimensions.

We present a formal model of CoinAlgs, with definitions of privacy (incomplete algorithm disclosure) and economic fairness (value extraction by an adversarial insider). We prove two complementary results that together demonstrate the CoinAlg Bind. First, privacy in a CoinAlg is a precondition for insider attacks on economic fairness. Conversely, in a game-theoretic model, lack of privacy, i.e., transparency, enables arbitrageurs to erode the profitability of a CoinAlg. Using data from Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, we empirically study both sides of the CoinAlg Bind. We quantify the impact of arbitrage against transparent CoinAlgs.

We design a computationally efficient algorithm derived from the MinScore algorithm, leveraging dynamic pruning and pattern caching to exactly calculate this metric during play. Opponent hand-modeling is also incorporated within a two-player zero-sum simulation framework, and the resulting strategies are evaluated using statistical hypothesis testing.

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00696v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Many multi-agent interaction scenarios can be naturally modeled as noncooperative games, where each agent's decisions depend on others' future actions. However, deploying game-theoretic planners for autonomous decision-making requires a specification of all agents' objectives. To circumvent this practical difficulty, recent work develops maximum likelihood techniques for solving inverse games that can identify unknown agent objectives from interaction data. Unfortunately, these methods only infer point estimates and do not quantify estimator uncertainty; correspondingly, downstream planning decisions can overconfidently commit to unsafe actions. We present an approximate Bayesian inference approach for solving the inverse game problem, which can incorporate observation data from multiple modalities and be used to generate samples from the Bayesian posterior over the hidden agent objectives given limited sensor observations in real time. Concretely, the proposed Bayesian inverse game framework trains a structured variational autoencoder with an embedded differentiable Nash game solver on interaction datasets and does not require labels of agents' true objectives. Extensive experiments show that our framework successfully learns prior and posterior distributions, improves inference quality over maximum likelihood estimation-based inverse game approaches, and enables safer downstream decision-making without sacrificing efficiency. When trajectory information is uninformative or unavailable, multimodal inference further reduces uncertainty by exploiting additional observation modalities.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2509.18673v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The existence of allocations that are fair and efficient, simultaneously, is a central inquiry in fair division literature. A prominent result in discrete fair division shows that the complementary desiderata of fairness and efficiency can be achieved together when allocating indivisible items with nonnegative values; specifically, for indivisible goods and among agents with additive valuations, there always exists an allocation that is both envy-free up to one item (EF1) and Pareto efficient (PO). While a recent breakthrough extends the EF1 and PO guarantee to indivisible chores (items with negative values), the question remains open for indivisible mixed manna, i.e., for indivisible items whose values can be positive, negative, or zero. The current work makes notable progress in resolving this central question.\n  For indivisible mixed manna and additive valuations, we establish the existence of allocations that are PO and introspectively envy-free up to one item (IEF1). In an IEF1 allocation, each agent can eliminate its envy towards all the other agents by either adding an item or removing an item from its own bundle. The notion of IEF1 coincides with EF1 for indivisible chores, and hence, our result generalizes the aforementioned existence guarantee for chores. Our techniques can be adopted to obtain an alternative proof for the existence of EF1 and PO allocations of indivisible goods. Hence, along with the result for mixed manna, we provide a unified approach for establishing the EF1 and PO guarantee for indivisible goods and indivisible chores. We also utilize our result for indivisible items to develop a distinct proof of the noted EF and PO guarantee for divisible mixed manna. Our work highlights an interesting application of the Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz (KKM) Theorem in discrete fair division and develops multiple, novel structural insights and algorithmic ideas.",

To this end, we introduce a class of models that interpolate between the short-range Anderson model on a random regular graph and fully connected models with statistically uniform hopping, by embedding a random regular graph into a complete graph and allowing hopping amplitudes to decay exponentially with graph distance. The competition between the exponentially growing number of neighbours with graph distance and the exponentially decaying hopping amplitude positions our models effectively as power-law hopping generalisation of the Anderson model on random regular graphs. Using a combination of numerical exact diagonalisation and analytical renormalised perturbation theory, we establish the resulting localisation phase diagram emerging from the interplay of the lengthscale associated to the hopping range and the onsite disorder strength. We find that increasing the hopping range shifts the localisation transition to stronger disorder, and that beyond a critical range the localised phase ceases to exist even at arbitrarily strong disorder. Our results indicate a direct Anderson transition between delocalised and localised phases, with no evidence for an intervening multifractal phase, for both deterministic and random hopping models. A scaling analysis based on inverse participation ratios reveals behaviour consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless-like transition with two-parameter scaling, in line with Anderson transitions on high-dimensional graphs. We also observe distinct critical behaviour in average and typical correlation functions, reflecting the different scaling properties of generalised inverse participation ratios.",

In this work, we develop an RG framework to analyze self-similarity and its breakdown in learning curves for a class of weakly non-linear (non-lazy) neural networks trained on power-law distributed data. Features often neglected in standard treatments -- such as spectrum discreteness and lack of translation invariance -- lead to both quantitative and qualitative departures from conventional perturbative RG.

Simultaneous backscattering observations by the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) precisely constrain the comet's ~7 mag forward scattering brightening, enabling a direct comparison with the ~3 mag brightening of the more active but optically dust-poor comet 2P/Encke seen by SOHO and STEREO under similar geometry in 2017. Earlier STEREO observations from 2014 additionally show the newly recognized activity to be recurrent -- consistent with a reanalysis of the comet's associated meteor activity -- and has likely only been previously overlooked due to the comet's faintness and proximity to the Sun while active. Orbital integrations show the comet has likely followed a near-Earth orbit for at least the past 10 kyr, suggesting that the weakness of its observed activity evolved through its continued depletion of accessible volatiles.",

Even though no conclusive evidence has been found for atmospheres on small rocky exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs, recent JWST observations identified puzzling thermal emission excesses: some rocky exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs have dayside emission temperatures higher than the theoretical maximum. Theoretical maximum temperatures assume stellar irradiation as the sole energy source, implying that these planets may have internal heat sources. In this work, we simulate three possible planetary internal processes that may generate excessive heat in addition to stellar irradiation: residual heating from formation, tidal heating, and induction heating due to interactions with the stellar magnetic field. We found that these mechanisms, even when combined, cannot explain the observed thermal emission excesses, nor can they explain a tentative positive trend in the brightness temperature scaling factor as a function of irradiation temperature. Our results imply that planetary internal processes are unlikely to generate remotely detectable heat, so the observed thermal excesses, if astrophysical, are likely caused by stellar contamination, surface processes, or other internal processes not considered in this study. The ongoing JWST-HST Rocky Worlds Director's Discretionary Time Program and the upcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will provide more insights into the thermal emission of rocky exoplanets.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00606v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Atmospheric variations over time and space boost planetary cooling, as outgoing internal flux responds to stellar radiation and opacity. Vertical mixing regulates this cooling. Our study examines how gravity waves or large-scale induced mixing interact with radiation transfer, affecting temperature inhomogeneity and internal flux. Through the radiative-convective-mixing equilibrium, mixing increases temperature inhomogeneity in the middle and lower atmospheres, redistributing internal flux. Stronger stellar radiation and mixing significantly reduce outgoing flux, slowing cooling. With constant infrared (IR) opacity, lower visible opacity and stronger mixing significantly reduce outgoing flux. Jensen's inequality implies that greater spatial disparities in stellar flux and opacity elevate the ratio of the average internal flux in inhomogeneous columns relative to that in homogeneous columns. This effect, particularly pronounced under high opacity contrasts, amplifies deep-layer temperature inhomogeneity and may enhance cooling. However, with mixing, overall cooling is weaker than without, as both the averaged internal flux of the inhomogeneous columns and that of the homogeneous column decline more sharply for the latter. Thus, while vertical mixing-induced inhomogeneity can enhance cooling, the overall cooling effect remains weaker than in the non-mixing case. Therefore, vertical mixing, by regulating atmospheric structure and flux, is key to understanding planetary cooling.",

The prevailing view for the origin of this three-body resonance involves the convergent migration of the moons, resulting from gas-driven torques in the circum-Jovian disk wherein they accreted. To account for Callisto's exclusion from the resonant chain, a late and/or slow accretion of the fourth and outermost Galilean moon is typically invoked, stalling its migration. Here, we consider an alternative scenario in which Callisto's nonresonant orbit is a consequence of disk substructure. Using a suite of N-body simulations that self-consistently account for satellite-disk interactions, we show that a pressure bump can function as a migration trap, isolating Callisto and alleviating constraints on its timing of accretion. Our simulations position the bump interior to the birthplaces of all four moons. In exploring the impact of bump structure on simulation outcomes, we find that it cannot be too sharp nor flat to yield the observed orbital architecture. In particular, a \"Goldilocks\" zone is mapped in parameter space, corresponding to a well-defined range in bump aspect ratio. Within this range, Io, Europa, and Ganymede are sequentially trapped at the bump, and ushered across it through resonant lockstep migration with their neighboring, exterior moon. The implications of our work are discussed in the context of uncertainties regarding Callisto's interior structure, arising from the possibility of non-hydrostatic contributions to its shape and gravity field, unresolved by the Galileo spacecraft.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00149v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Given a 4D symplectic map $F_0$ that has a normally hyperbolic invariant cylinder foliated by invariant tori, those with rational rotation numbers are themselves foliated by subharmonic periodic orbits (SPOs). If $F_0$ is part of a perturbative family $F_\\varepsilon$, one is often interested in computing those SPOs which persist for $\\varepsilon >0$. Assuming that a persisting SPO of $F_0$ has been identified, in this paper, we develop a quasi-Newton method which solves for the SPO simultaneously with its Floquet vectors and multipliers. This in turn enables continuation by the perturbation parameter $\\varepsilon$. The resulting SPO and Floquet vectors are then used to compute Taylor parameterizations of the SPO's weak stable and unstable manifolds, if they exist. Our quasi-Newton method is based on an adaptation of the parameterization method for invariant tori, with this paper being the first-ever to apply such a framework to directly compute periodic orbit points themselves. The new algorithm improves on efficiency compared to prior multi-shooting methods for SPOs, and notably applies to the case of stroboscopic maps of 2.5 DOF Hamiltonian flows resulting from periodic perturbations of 2 DOF systems. The tools have been successfully used for studies of resonant orbits in perturbed real-life celestial systems, the results of which are summarized as a demonstration of the methods' utility.",

In this work, we present a targeted observational search for Planet Nine in a field of approximately 98 square-degrees. This field is close to the highest probability region of finding Planet Nine, according to simulations, but poorly constrained by previous searches. Our observations and search methodology, based on the detection of parallax position shifts between consecutive nights, work well in these conditions. We provide 85% confidence exclusion limits for objects with Sloan r-band magnitudes brighter than between 21.0 and 21.4, with an average sensitivity limit of 21.3. No credible Planet Nine candidates were identified within this field and magnitude limits. A caveat to our approach is that it would miss a candidate if its position were affected by scattered light from bright stars in at least one of the nights. However, we estimate that the probability for this is very low, around 0.4%. We discuss several possible reasons for our Planet Nine non-detection. Our study complements prior searches, particularly those using archival survey data that are limited in the Galactic plane or at fainter brightness limits.

Deriving observables aligned with the prediction of the canonical ensemble for a quantum system relies on the presence of a bath provided either as an external environment or as a larger part of a closed system. We demonstrate that thermal (canonical) observables for a whole closed quantum system of finite size can arise in the absence of a bath. These thermal observables stem from classical averaging over randomized unitary evolutions for a few-body system. The temperature in the canonical ensemble appears as a global constraint on the total energy of the system, determined by the choice of the initial state. From averaging randomized evolutions, we derive spin-spin correlation functions for a finite spin chain and show that they exhibit a temperature-dependent finite correlation length, in agreement with the prediction of the canonical ensemble. This establishes a method for computing thermal observables in a closed, finite-size system from real-time propagation without a bath.

For a Hamiltonian consisting of operators admitting rational number matrix representations, we prove a theorem that, if its center of commutant algebra have all eigenvalues being rational, the HSF from the ICPF method must be equal to or finer than that from the CA method. We show that this condition is satisfied by most known models exhibiting HSF, for which we demonstrate the validity of our theorem.

We demonstrate that the system's transition from chaos to active turbulence is characterized by quantized loop phase currents and coherent clustering, and that this transition is strictly governed by a kinetic Turing instability. By deriving the continuum kinetic theory for the model, we identify that the competition between local phase-locking and active agent motility selects a critical structural wavenumber. The instability then drives the system into a state of developed, active turbulence that exhibits stable, robust power-laws in spectral density, suggestive of universality and consistent with observations from a broad range of turbulent phenomena. Our results bridge the gap between discrete chimera states and continuous fluid turbulence, suggesting that the statistical scaling laws of active turbulence can arise from fundamental kinetic instability criteria.",

Repeating this process by randomly sampling step length and turning angle defines a two-dimensional random walk in what we call comoving frame coordinates. This is precisely how Ross and Pearson proposed to model the movements of organisms more than a century ago. Decades later their concept was generalised by including persistence leading to a correlated random walk, which became a popular model in Movement Ecology. In contrast, Langevin equations describing cell migration and used in active matter theory are typically formulated by position and velocity in a fixed Cartesian frame. In this article, we explore the transformation of stochastic Langevin dynamics from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. We show that the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the Cartesian velocity of a walker can be transformed exactly into a stochastic process that is defined self-consistently in the comoving frame, thereby profoundly generalising correlated random walk models. This approach yields a general conceptual framework how to transform stochastic processes from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. Our theory paves the way to derive, invent and explore novel stochastic processes in the comoving frame for modelling the movements of organisms. It can also be applied to design novel stochastic dynamics for autonomously moving robots and drones.",

However, it is widely believed that topological properties are destroyed when the bulk energy gap closes, making it highly nontrivial to consider topology in gapless quantum critical systems. To address these challenges, recent advancements have sought to generalize the notion of topology to systems without a bulk energy gap, including quantum critical points and critical phases, collectively referred to as gapless symmetry-protected topological states. Extending topology to gapless quantum critical systems challenges the traditional belief in condensed matter physics that topological edge states are typically tied to the presence of a bulk energy gap. Furthermore, it suggests that topology plays a crucial role in classifying quantum phase transitions even if they belong to the same universality class, fundamentally enriching the textbook understanding of phase transitions. Given its importance, here we give a pedagogical review of the current progress of topological physics in quantum critical systems. We introduce the topological properties of quantum critical points and generalize them to stable critical phases, both for noninteracting and interacting systems.

To this end, we introduce a class of models that interpolate between the short-range Anderson model on a random regular graph and fully connected models with statistically uniform hopping, by embedding a random regular graph into a complete graph and allowing hopping amplitudes to decay exponentially with graph distance. The competition between the exponentially growing number of neighbours with graph distance and the exponentially decaying hopping amplitude positions our models effectively as power-law hopping generalisation of the Anderson model on random regular graphs. Using a combination of numerical exact diagonalisation and analytical renormalised perturbation theory, we establish the resulting localisation phase diagram emerging from the interplay of the lengthscale associated to the hopping range and the onsite disorder strength. We find that increasing the hopping range shifts the localisation transition to stronger disorder, and that beyond a critical range the localised phase ceases to exist even at arbitrarily strong disorder. Our results indicate a direct Anderson transition between delocalised and localised phases, with no evidence for an intervening multifractal phase, for both deterministic and random hopping models. A scaling analysis based on inverse participation ratios reveals behaviour consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless-like transition with two-parameter scaling, in line with Anderson transitions on high-dimensional graphs.

These projected ensembles encode fine-grained information beyond thermal expectation values and provide a new window into quantum thermalization. In chaotic dynamics, projected ensembles exhibit universal statistics, a phenomenon known as deep thermalization. While infinite-temperature systems generate Haar-random ensembles, realistic physical constraints such as finite temperature or conservation laws require a more general framework. It has been proposed that deep thermalization is governed in general by the emergence of Scrooge ensembles, maximally entropic distributions of pure states consistent with the underlying constraints. Here we provide rigorous arguments supporting this proposal. To characterize this universal behavior, we invoke Scrooge $k$-designs, which approximate Scrooge ensembles, and identify three physically distinct mechanisms for their emergence. First, global Scrooge designs can arise from long-time chaotic unitary dynamics alone, without the need for measurements. Second, if the global state is highly scrambled, a local Scrooge design is induced when the complementary subsystem is measured. Third, a local Scrooge ensemble arises from an arbitrary entangled state when the complementary system is measured in a highly scrambled basis. Numerical simulations across a range of many-body systems identify coherence, entanglement, non-stabilizerness, and information scrambling as essential resources for the emergence of Scrooge-like behavior.

Here, we establish an exact and physically transparent relationship between effective graph resistance and the cumulative heat dissipation generated by Laplacian diffusion dynamics. We show that the total heat dissipated during relaxation to equilibrium precisely equals the effective graph resistance. This dynamical viewpoint uncovers a natural multi-scale decomposition of the Laplacian spectrum: early-time dissipation is governed by degree-based local structure, intermediate times isolate eigenvalues below the spectral mean, and long times are dominated by the algebraic connectivity. These multi-scale properties yield continuous and interpretable strategies for modifying network structure and constructing optimized ensembles, enabling improvements that are otherwise NP-hard to achieve via combinatorial methods.

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00761v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Quantum magic, quantified by nonstabilizerness, measures departures from stabilizer structure and underlies potential quantum speedups. We introduce an efficient classical algorithm that exactly computes stabilizer R\\'enyi entropies and stabilizer nullity for generic many-body wavefunctions of $N$ qubits. The method combines the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform with an exact partition of Pauli operators. It achieves an exponential speedup over direct approaches, reducing the average cost per sampled Pauli string from $O(2^N)$ to $O(N)$. Building on this framework, we further develop a Monte-Carlo estimator for stabilizer R\\'enyi entropies together with a Clifford-based variance-reduction scheme that suppresses sampling fluctuations. We benchmark the accuracy and efficiency on ensembles of random magic states, and apply the method to random Clifford circuits with doped $T$ gates, comparing different doping architectures. Our approach applies to arbitrary quantum states and provides quantitative access to magic resources both encoded in highly entangled states and generated by long-time nonequilibrium dynamics.",

Additionally, the model exhibits consistency properties. The correct entropy production is ensured when auxiliary temperatures in the chemical contributions share a common value. We assume isotropic distributions and perform numerical simulations for the macroscopic fields to appraise how the dynamics push the mixture toward thermalization and chemical equilibrium. We show that the hypothesis on the equalization of fictitious species temperatures is justifiable to ensure the monotonicity of the classical $H$-Boltzmann functional. Simulations show that, when initial temperatures are far from equilibrium, the relaxation towards equilibrium occurs at a later stage and the classical $H$-Boltzmann functional is not monotone during the initial transient.",

We analyze three distinct models that specify how the transition rates depend on $U_x$: the random-force-like model, random walks with randomized stepping times, and the Gaussian trap model. Our analysis focuses on five key disorder-dependent quantities defined for a finite chain with $N$ sites: the probability current, its reciprocal (the resistance), the splitting probability, the mean first-passage time $T_N$, and the diffusion coefficient $D_N$ in a periodic chain. By determining the moments of these random variables, we demonstrate that the probability current, resistance, and splitting probability are not self-averaging, which leads to pronounced differences between their average and typical behaviors. In contrast, $T_N$ and $D_N$ become self-averaging when $N \\to \\infty$, though they exhibit strong sample-to-sample fluctuations for finite $N$.",

In many biological and soft-matter systems, distinct components of the medium exhibit unique viscoelastic responses, resulting in time-dependent changes in the observed diffusion exponents. Here, we develop a theoretical model of two particles, each embedded in a distinct viscoelastic medium, and coupled via a harmonic potential. By formulating and solving a system of coupled fractional Langevin equations (FLEs) with memory exponents $0<\\alpha<\\beta\\leq 1$, we uncover rich transient anomalous diffusion phenomena arising from the interplay of memory kernels and bilinear coupling. Notably, we identify recovery dynamics, where a subdiffusive particle ($\\alpha$) transiently accelerates and eventually regains its intrinsic long-time mobility. This recovery emerges only when memory exponents differ ($\\alpha<\\beta$), whereas identical exponents ($\\alpha=\\beta$) suppress recovery. Our theoretical predictions offer insight into experimentally observed transient anomalous diffusions, such as polymer--protein complexes and cross-linked cytoskeletal networks, highlighting the critical role of memory heterogeneity and mechanical interactions in biological anomalous diffusion.",

In this work, we develop a variational TN framework based on Grassmann tensor networks, which natively encode fermionic statistics while preserving locality. By incorporating locally defined Clifford circuits within the fermionic formalism, we simulate benchmark models including the tight-binding and $t$-$V$ models. Our results show that Clifford disentangling removes the classically simulable component of entanglement, leading to a reduced bond dimension and improved accuracy in ground-state energy estimates. Interestingly, once the natural Grassmann-evenness requirement of the fermionic formulation is taken into account and Clifford gates with identical entanglement action are grouped together, the original set of 11520 two-qubit Clifford gates reduces to only 12 distinct gates. This strong reduction leads to a more efficient disentangling scheme within the fermionic framework. These findings highlight the potential of Clifford-augmented Grassmann TNs as a scalable and accurate tool for studying strongly correlated fermionic systems, particularly in higher dimensions.",

The use of data for reduced-order modeling is an important developing research direction, especially when the high-dimensional system operators are unknown and their low-dimensional approximation is required for accurate but fast simulations. Our goal is to obtain the low-dimensional surrogate model from the available input signal and deformation trajectory data, capturing the correct system behavior for the basic deformation cases, namely bending and rotation, which are present in almost every complex mechanical system.\n  In this work, we propose a methodology to infer the system operators by solving a nonlinear unconstrained optimization problem.

If $F_0$ is part of a perturbative family $F_\\varepsilon$, one is often interested in computing those SPOs which persist for $\\varepsilon >0$. Assuming that a persisting SPO of $F_0$ has been identified, in this paper, we develop a quasi-Newton method which solves for the SPO simultaneously with its Floquet vectors and multipliers. This in turn enables continuation by the perturbation parameter $\\varepsilon$. The resulting SPO and Floquet vectors are then used to compute Taylor parameterizations of the SPO's weak stable and unstable manifolds, if they exist. Our quasi-Newton method is based on an adaptation of the parameterization method for invariant tori, with this paper being the first-ever to apply such a framework to directly compute periodic orbit points themselves. The new algorithm improves on efficiency compared to prior multi-shooting methods for SPOs, and notably applies to the case of stroboscopic maps of 2.5 DOF Hamiltonian flows resulting from periodic perturbations of 2 DOF systems.

From a different perspective, our result is also motivated by egrodic theory, as it can be seen as an effective version of the ``spectral\" gap in the top Oseledets space in the Oseledets multiplicative ergodic theorem for the random Markov operator cocycle (when it applies). We also present applications of the effective ergodicity to rates in the (quenched) almost sure invariance principle (ASIP), exponential decay of correlations for Markovian skew products and for exponential tails for random mixing times. As a byproduct of the proof of the ASIP rates we also provide easy to verify sufficient conditions for the verification of the assumptions of \\cite[Theorem 2.4]{Kifer 1998}.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00638v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This paper establishes a rigorous mathematical framework for the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled System (MNCS), a dynamical model describing hierarchical state spaces with directed, sign-structured interactions. We address the stabilization of reaction-diffusion systems on bounded domains $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d \\le 3$) subject to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. A critical feature of this setting is the \"zero-mode singularity,\" where the Laplacian operator possesses a trivial zero eigenvalue ($\\lambda_0=0$), providing no linear dissipation for the spatial mean. We rigorously prove the global well-posedness of the system and the existence of a compact global attractor $\\mathcal{A}$ in the phase space $\\mathbb{H}=(L^2(\\Omega))^N$. Utilizing the Moser-Alikakos iteration technique, we establish uniform $L^\\infty(\\Omega)$ bounds, overcoming the lack of Sobolev embedding from $H^1$ into $L^\\infty$ in three dimensions. These bounds enable the derivation of explicit upper estimates for the fractal dimension of the attractor via the Kaplan-Yorke trace formula. We show that the dimension scales as $d_F(\\mathcal{A}) \\sim \\max\\{0, \\mathcal{K}_{\\mathcal{A}}-\\gamma\\}^{d/2}$, confirming that the negative coupling strength $\\gamma$ acts as a global regularizer that compresses the phase space.

Populations evolve over time according to a piecewise linear system of ordinary differential equations subject to a non-negativity constraint resulting in discrete time extinction and revival events. The dynamics are generated by a random elliptic community matrix with tunable correlation strength. We show that, independent of the correlation strength, solutions of the system are confined to subsets of the phase space that can be cast as time-varying Gardner volumes from the theory of learning in neural networks. These volumes decrease with the diversity (i.e. the fraction of extant species) and become exponentially small in the long-time limit. Using standard results from random matrix theory, the changing diversity is then linked to a sequence of contractions and expansions in the spectrum of the community matrix over time, resulting in a sequence of May-type stability problems determining whether the total population evolves toward complete extinction or unbounded growth. In the case of unbounded growth, we show the model allows for a particularly simple nonlinear extension in which the solutions instead evolve towards a new attractor.",

The most important result of the work describes the size of the set of resonance levels in the form of the following trichotomy: it is mostly empty or is one-element or is large, i.e. non-empty and open. In this latter case, we show that an abundance of resonant orbits occurs only when the potentials are of a special type; we denote this family by $\\mathcal{SP}$.

Programmable memristive hardware offers a promising substrate for such post-deployment adaptation; however, practical realization is challenged by limited weight resolution, device variability, nonlinear programming dynamics, and finite device endurance. In this work, we show that spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be deployed on ferroelectric memristive synaptic devices for adaptive EEG-based motor imagery decoding under realistic device constraints. We fabricate, characterize, and model ferroelectric synapses. We evaluate a convolutional-recurrent SNN architecture under two complementary deployment strategies: (i) device-aware training using a ferroelectric synapse model, and (ii) transfer of software-trained weights followed by low-overhead on-device re-tuning. To enable efficient adaptation, we introduce a device-aware weight-update strategy in which gradient-based updates are accumulated digitally and converted into discrete programming events only when a threshold is exceeded, emulating nonlinear, state-dependent programming dynamics while reducing programming frequency. Both deployment strategies achieve classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art software-based SNNs. Furthermore, subject-specific transfer learning achieved by retraining only the final network layers improves classification accuracy. These results demonstrate that programmable ferroelectric hardware can support robust, low-overhead adaptation in spiking neural networks, opening a practical path toward personalized neuromorphic processing of neural signals.",

This challenge motivates renewed interest in neuromorphic computing principles, which promise brain-like efficiency through discrete and sparse activations, recurrent dynamics, and non-linear feedback. In fact, modern AI architectures increasingly embody neuromorphic principles through heavily quantized activations, state-space dynamics, and sparse attention mechanisms. This paper elaborates on the connections between neuromorphic models, state-space models, and transformer architectures through the lens of the distinction between intra-token processing and inter-token processing. Most early work on neuromorphic AI was based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for intra-token processing, i.e., for transformations involving multiple channels, or features, of the same vector input, such as the pixels of an image. In contrast, more recent research has explored how neuromorphic principles can be leveraged to design efficient inter-token processing methods, which selectively combine different information elements depending on their contextual relevance. Implementing associative memorization mechanisms, these approaches leverage state-space dynamics or sparse self-attention. Along with a systematic presentation of modern neuromorphic AI models through the lens of intra-token and inter-token processing, training methodologies for neuromorphic AI models are also reviewed. These range from surrogate gradients leveraging parallel convolutional processing to local learning rules based on reinforcement learning mechanisms.",

An adaptive compression mechanism, governed by a novel retention factor derived from simulated astrocyte long-term plasticity (LTP), modulates these tokens. Attention within segments utilizes an efficient, linear-complexity mechanism inspired by astrocyte short-term plasticity (STP).

Recent years have seen substantial advances in deep learning-based methods for spontaneous EEG and other non-time-locked task-related EEG signals. However, their effectiveness on ERP data remains underexplored, and many existing ERP studies still rely heavily on manually extracted features. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study that systematically compares traditional manual features (followed by a linear classifier), deep learning models, and pre-trained EEG foundation models for ERP analysis. We establish a unified data preprocessing and training pipeline and evaluate these approaches on two representative tasks, ERP stimulus classification and ERP-based brain disease detection, across 12 publicly available datasets. Furthermore, we investigate various patch-embedding strategies within advanced Transformer architectures to identify embedding designs that better suit ERP data.

Learnable parameters that delay spike times can improve classification performance in temporal tasks, but existing methods rely on large networks and offline learning, making them unsuitable for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce synaptic and axonal delays to leaky integrate and fire (LIF)-based feedforward and recurrent SNNs, and propose three-factor learning rules to simultaneously learn delay parameters online. We employ a smooth Gaussian surrogate to approximate spike derivatives exclusively for the eligibility trace calculation, and together with a top-down error signal determine parameter updates. Our experiments show that incorporating delays improves accuracy by up to 20% over a weights-only baseline, and for networks with similar parameter counts, jointly learning weights and delays yields up to 14% higher accuracy. On the SHD speech recognition dataset, our method achieves similar accuracy to offline backpropagation-based approaches. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, it reduces model size by 6.6x and inference latency by 67%, with only a 2.4% drop in classification accuracy.

However, their large computational cost, huge memory footprints, and high processing power/energy make it challenging for their embedded deployments. Amid several tinyLLMs, recent works have proposed spike-driven language models (SLMs) for significantly reducing the processing power/energy of LLMs. However, their memory footprints still remain too large for low-cost and resource-constrained embedded devices. Manual quantization approach may effectively compress SLM memory footprints, but it requires a huge design time and compute power to find the quantization setting for each network, hence making this approach not-scalable for handling different networks, performance requirements, and memory budgets. To bridge this gap, we propose QSLM, a novel framework that performs automated quantization for compressing pre-trained SLMs, while meeting the performance and memory constraints. To achieve this, QSLM first identifies the hierarchy of the given network architecture and the sensitivity of network layers under quantization, then employs a tiered quantization strategy (e.g., global-, block-, and module-level quantization) while leveraging a multi-objective performance-and-memory trade-off function to select the final quantization setting. Experimental results indicate that our QSLM reduces memory footprint by up to 86.5%, reduces power consumption by up to 20%, maintains high performance across different tasks (i.e., by up to 84.4% accuracy of sentiment classification on the SST-2 dataset and perplexity score of 23.2 for text generation on the WikiText-2 dataset) close to the original non-quantized model while meeting the performance and memory constraints.",

The system consists of a set of serial processing tasks, each with a given duration, unit execution cost, and precedence constraints, which must be assigned to an unlimited number of stations subject to a per-station duration bound. The objective is to minimize the total production cost, modeled as a station-wise function of task costs and the duration bound, while strictly satisfying all prerequisite and capacity constraints. Two chromosome encoding strategies are investigated: a station-based representation implemented using the JGAP library with SuperGene validity checks, and a task-based representation in which genes encode station assignments directly. For each encoding, standard GA operators (crossover, mutation, selection, and replacement) are adapted to preserve feasibility and drive the population toward lower-cost schedules. Experimental results on three classes of precedence structures-tightly coupled, loosely coupled, and uncoupled-demonstrate that the task-based encoding yields smoother convergence and more reliable cost minimization than the station-based encoding, particularly when the number of valid schedules is large. The study highlights the advantages of GA over gradient-based and analytical methods for combinatorial scheduling problems, especially in the presence of complex constraints and non-differentiable cost landscapes.",

AEs are minimally perturbed input data undetectable to humans posing significant risks to security-dependent applications. Hence, extensive research has been undertaken to develop defense mechanisms that mitigate their threats. Most existing methods primarily focus on discriminating AEs based on the input sample features, emphasizing AE detection without addressing the correct sample categorization before an attack. While some tasks may only require mere rejection on detected AEs, others necessitate identifying the correct original input category such as traffic sign recognition in autonomous driving. The objective of this study is to propose a method for rectifying AEs to estimate the correct labels of their original inputs. Our method is based on re-attacking AEs to move them beyond the decision boundary for accurate label prediction, effectively addressing the issue of rectifying minimally perceptible AEs created using white-box attack methods. However, challenge remains with respect to effectively rectifying AEs produced by black-box attacks at a distance from the boundary, or those misclassified into low-confidence categories by targeted attacks. By adopting a straightforward approach of only considering AEs as inputs, the proposed method can address diverse attacks while avoiding the requirement of parameter adjustments or preliminary training. Results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits consistent performance in rectifying AEs generated via various attack methods, including targeted and black-box attacks. Moreover, it outperforms conventional rectification and input transformation methods in terms of stability against various attacks.",

Designing paint paths for these robotic arms, which involves assigning car body areas to arms and determining paint sequences for each arm, remains a time-consuming manual task for engineers, indicating the demand for automation and design time reduction. The unique constraints of the painting process hinder the direct application of conventional robotic path planning techniques, such as those used in welding. Therefore, this paper formulates the design of paint paths as a hierarchical optimization problem, where the upper-layer subproblem resembles a vehicle routing problem (VRP), and the lower-layer subproblem involves detailed path planning. This approach allows the use of different optimization algorithms at each layer, and permits flexible handling of constraints specific to the vehicle painting process through the design of variable representation, constraints, repair operators, and an initialization process at the upper and lower layers. Experiments with three commercially available vehicle models demonstrated that the proposed method can automatically design paths that satisfy all constraints for vehicle painting with quality comparable to those created manually by engineers.",

Inspired by these capabilities, this paper introduces ReCiSt, a bio-inspired agentic self-healing framework designed to achieve resilience in Distributed Computing Continuum Systems (DCCS). Modern DCCS integrate heterogeneous computing resources, ranging from resource-constrained IoT devices to high-performance cloud infrastructures, and their inherent complexity, mobility, and dynamic operating conditions expose them to frequent faults that disrupt service continuity. These challenges underscore the need for scalable, adaptive, and self-regulated resilience strategies. ReCiSt reconstructs the biological phases of Hemostasis, Inflammation, Proliferation, and Remodeling into the computational layers Containment, Diagnosis, Meta-Cognitive, and Knowledge for DCCS. These four layers perform autonomous fault isolation, causal diagnosis, adaptive recovery, and long-term knowledge consolidation through Language Model (LM)-powered agents. These agents interpret heterogeneous logs, infer root causes, refine reasoning pathways, and reconfigure resources with minimal human intervention. The proposed ReCiSt framework is evaluated on public fault datasets using multiple LMs, and no baseline comparison is included due to the scarcity of similar approaches. Nevertheless, our results, evaluated under different LMs, confirm ReCiSt's self-healing capabilities within tens of seconds with minimum of 10% of agent CPU usage.

Recent work proposing a framework for training BNNs based on quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation (QUBO) and progress in the design of Ising machines for solving QUBO problems suggest a potential path to efficiently optimising discrete neural networks. In this work, we extend existing QUBO models for training BNNs to accommodate arbitrary network topologies and propose two novel methods for regularisation. The first method maximises neuron margins biasing the training process toward parameter configurations that yield larger pre-activation magnitudes. The second method employs a dropout-inspired iterative scheme in which reduced subnetworks are trained and used to adjust linear penalties on network parameters. We apply the proposed QUBO formulation to a small binary image classification problem and conduct computational experiments on a GPU-based Ising machine.

However, NAS suffers from a critical bottleneck, i.e. the evaluation of numerous architectures during the search process demands substantial computing resources and time. In order to improve the efficiency of NAS, a series of methods have been proposed to reduce the evaluation time of neural architectures. However, they are not efficient enough and still only focus on the accuracy of architectures. Beyond classification accuracy, real-world applications increasingly demand more efficient and compact network architectures that balance multiple performance criteria. To address these challenges, we propose the SMEMNAS, a pairwise comparison relation-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on a multi-population mechanism. In the SMEMNAS, a surrogate model is constructed based on pairwise comparison relations to predict the accuracy ranking of architectures, rather than the absolute accuracy. Moreover, two populations cooperate with each other in the search process, i.e. a main population that guides the evolutionary process, while a vice population that enhances search diversity. Our method aims to discover high-performance models that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives. We conduct comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets to validate the effectiveness of our approach. With only a single GPU searching for 0.17 days, competitive architectures can be found by SMEMNAS which achieves 78.91% accuracy with the MAdds of 570M on the ImageNet. This work makes a significant advancement in the field of NAS.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2409.15298v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: For reasons such as privacy, there are use cases for language models at the edge. This has given rise to small language models targeted for deployment in resource-constrained devices where energy efficiency is critical. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising solution due to their energy efficiency, and there are already works on realizing transformer-based models on SNNs. However, key operations like softmax and layer normalization (LN) are difficult to implement on neuromorphic hardware, and many of these early works sidestepped them. To address these challenges, we introduce Sorbet, a transformer-based spiking language model that is more neuromorphic hardware-compatible. Sorbet incorporates a novel shifting-based softmax called PTsoftmax and a Bit Shifting PowerNorm (BSPN), both designed to replace the respective energy-intensive operations. By leveraging knowledge distillation and model quantization, Sorbet achieved a highly compressed binary weight model that maintains competitive performance while achieving $27.16\\times$ energy savings compared to BERT. We validate Sorbet through extensive testing on the GLUE benchmark and a series of ablation studies, demonstrating its potential as an energy-efficient solution for language model inference.

    "summary": "arXiv:2501.06572v5 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Deep learning models trained on finite data lack a complete understanding of the physical world. On the other hand, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are infused with such knowledge through the incorporation of mathematically expressible laws of nature into their training loss function. By complying with physical laws, PINNs provide advantages over purely data-driven models in limited-data regimes and present as a promising route towards Physical AI. This feature has propelled them to the forefront of scientific machine learning, a domain characterized by scarce and costly data. However, the vision of accurate physics-informed learning comes with significant challenges. This work examines PINNs in terms of model optimization and generalization, shedding light on the need for new algorithmic advances to overcome issues pertaining to the training speed, precision, and generalizability of today's PINN models. Of particular interest are gradient-free evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for optimizing the uniquely complex loss landscapes arising in PINN training. Methods synergizing gradient descent and EAs for discovering bespoke neural architectures and balancing multiple terms in physics-informed learning objectives are positioned as important avenues for future research. Another exciting track is to cast EAs as a meta-learner of generalizable PINN models. To substantiate these proposed avenues, we further highlight results from recent literature to showcase the early success of such approaches in addressing the aforementioned challenges in PINN optimization and generalization.",

Babies start learning to move in the restricted liquid area called placenta. Children often are limited by underdeveloped body. Even adults are not allowed to participate in complex competitions right away. However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. \"Swaddling\" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average. Temporal Advantage allows us to update Actor and Critic in one pass, as well as combine Actor and Critic in one Object and implement their Losses in one line.",

It had been a long-standing open question whether interacting bosonic systems also feature finite speeds of sound in information and particle propagation, which was only recently resolved.

A natural question arises: given a countable cardinal $\\kappa$, which is the event space of the $\\kappa$-times repeated experiment? In the case of classical experiments, where $\\mathsf{E}$ is a (complete) Boolean algebra on some set $S$, i.e. a \\textit{classical }or\\textit{ distributive logic}, the answer is more and less known: the (complete) Boolean algebra on $S^{\\kappa}$ generated by $\\mathsf{E}^{\\kappa}$. But, what if $\\mathsf{E}$ is not a Boolean algebra? In this paper we give a constructive answer to this question for any $\\kappa$ and in the context of general orthocomplemented complete lattices, i.e. \\textit{general logics}.

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00266v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recent advances in quantum simulators allow direct experimental access to the ensemble of pure states generated by measuring part of an isolated quantum many-body system. These projected ensembles encode fine-grained information beyond thermal expectation values and provide a new window into quantum thermalization. In chaotic dynamics, projected ensembles exhibit universal statistics, a phenomenon known as deep thermalization. While infinite-temperature systems generate Haar-random ensembles, realistic physical constraints such as finite temperature or conservation laws require a more general framework. It has been proposed that deep thermalization is governed in general by the emergence of Scrooge ensembles, maximally entropic distributions of pure states consistent with the underlying constraints. Here we provide rigorous arguments supporting this proposal. To characterize this universal behavior, we invoke Scrooge $k$-designs, which approximate Scrooge ensembles, and identify three physically distinct mechanisms for their emergence. First, global Scrooge designs can arise from long-time chaotic unitary dynamics alone, without the need for measurements. Second, if the global state is highly scrambled, a local Scrooge design is induced when the complementary subsystem is measured. Third, a local Scrooge ensemble arises from an arbitrary entangled state when the complementary system is measured in a highly scrambled basis. Numerical simulations across a range of many-body systems identify coherence, entanglement, non-stabilizerness, and information scrambling as essential resources for the emergence of Scrooge-like behavior. Taken together, our results establish a unified theoretical framework for the emergence of maximally entropic, information-stingy randomness in quantum many-body systems.",

The inclusion of a QPC breaks electron-hole (e-h) symmetry, leading to a finite thermovoltage. In contrast, earlier studies on hybrid junctions incorporating insulating barriers, as e-h symmetry is preserved, have vanishing thermovoltage, and consequently, $\\Delta_T$ noise is calculated at zero thermovoltage. In our setup, the broken e-h symmetry allows for a finite thermovoltage, at which we compute the corresponding $\\Delta_T$ noise. Unlike earlier studies restricted by e-h symmetry and vanishing thermovoltage, our work establishes a self-consistent framework in mesoscopic hybrid junctions, revealing how Andreev reflection fundamentally reshapes $\\Delta_T$ noise once e-h symmetry is broken. This broad access to charge fluctuation signatures provides a more comprehensive understanding of non-equilibrium transport in linear response.

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00751v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: In this work, we provide a self-contained derivation of the spin-operator matrix elements in the fermionic basis, for the critical Ising chain at a generic system length $N\\in 2Z_{\\ge 2}$. The approach relies on the near-Cauchy property of certain matrices formed by the Toeplitz symbol in the critical model, and leads to simpler product formulas for the dressing functions in terms of square root functions. These square root products allow fully dis-singularized integral representations. In the finite volume scaling limit, they further reduce to the Binet's second integral for the gamma function logarithm and its Hermite's generalization. As such, all the matrix elements in the scaling limit allow simple product formulas in terms of the gamma function at integer and half-integer arguments, and are rational numbers up to $\\sqrt{2}$. They are exactly the spin-operator form factors of the Ising CFT in the fermionic basis, whose explicit forms are much less well known in comparison to the finite-volume form factors in the massive theory. We also fully determine the normalization factor of the spin-operator and show explicitly how the coefficient $G(\\frac{1}{2})G(\\frac{3}{2})$ appear through a ground state overlap.",

As an illustration of the procedure, time-dependent frequency oscillators and time-dependent thermodynamic systems are analyzed from this point of view. The formalism provides a novel method for constructing contact Lie systems on the three-dimensional sphere, derived from recently established Lie-Hamilton systems arising from the fundamental four-dimensional representation of the symplectic Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{sp}(4,\\mathbb{R})$. It is shown that these systems are a particular case of a larger hierarchy of contact Lie systems on a special class of three-dimensional homogeneous spaces, namely the Cayley-Klein spaces. These include Riemannian spaces (sphere, hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces), pseudo-Riemannian spaces (anti-de Sitter, de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes), as well as Newtonian or non-relativistic spacetimes.

Through Noether's theorem in reverse, the LRL vector gives rise to a corresponding infinitesimal dynamical symmetry on the kinematical variables, which is well known in the literature. However, the physically relevant part of the LRL vector is its direction angle in the plane of motion (since its magnitude is just a function of energy and angular momentum). The present work derives the infinitesimal dynamical symmetry corresponding to the direction part of the LRL vector, and obtains the explicit form of the symmetry transformations that it generates. When combined with the rotation symmetries,the resulting symmetry group is shown to be the semi-direct product of $SO(3)$ and $R^3$. This stands in contrast to the $SO(4)$ symmetry group generated by the LRL symmetries and the rotations. As a by-product, the action of the new infinitesimal symmetries on all of the conserved quanties is obtained. The results are given in terms of the physical kinematical variables in the Kepler problem, rather than in an enlarged auxiliary space in which the LRL symmetries are usually stated.",

Yang reshaped modern physics through the introduction of non-abelian gauge theory and, independently, through the consistency conditions underlying what is now called the Yang-Baxter equation. Baxter transformed those conditions into a systematic theory of exact solvability in statistical mechanics and quantum integrable systems. This article is written in memory of Baxter and Yang, whose work revealed how local consistency principles generate global mathematical structure. We review the Yang-Mills formulation of gauge theory, its mass obstruction and resolution via symmetry breaking, and the geometric framework it engendered, including instantons, Donaldson-Floer theory, magnetic monopoles, and Hitchin systems. In parallel, we trace the emergence of the Yang-Baxter equation from factorised scattering to solvable lattice models, quantum groups, and Chern-Simons theory. Rather than separate narratives, gauge theory and integrability are presented as complementary manifestations of a shared coherence principle, an ongoing journey from gauge symmetry toward mathematical unity.",

Building on the statistical framework of Woodcock and Marusic (2015), the present work (i) poses an inverse problem to infer the ideal single-eddy contribution (influence) functions for the mean velocity and Reynolds stresses from DNS moments, (ii) uses these inferred kernels to guide a minimal Biot-Savart-consistent hairpin-type eddy built from Rankine vortex rods together with an inviscid image system, and (iii) introduces a spectral Influence kernel that maps a self-similar eddy footprint to its one-dimensional energy spectrum. The Influence-kernel viewpoint yields a transparent explanation for the emergence (and limitations) of the linear part of the energy spectrum, provides a clear scale-by-scale decomposition and helps rationalize why simple eddy templates can reproduce a broad set of log-layer statistics once the mean-flow anchoring is fixed.",

We focus on unimodal analytic potentials with the minimum at zero. The most important result of the work describes the size of the set of resonance levels in the form of the following trichotomy: it is mostly empty or is one-element or is large, i.e. non-empty and open. In this latter case, we show that an abundance of resonant orbits occurs only when the potentials are of a special type; we denote this family by $\\mathcal{SP}$.

As N -> infinity, the multiplicative groups Omega_N = (Z/NZ)^x form a non-tight family of probability spaces, and the probability weight associated with successful bases, proportional to p(success | a', N) p(a' | N), decays as 1/phi(N). The ensemble of uniform measures {mu_N} therefore admits no weak limit, implying an asymptotic loss of ergodicity. Monte Carlo simulations up to N <= 10^6 confirm this decay and the absence of a stationary success probability. These results demonstrate that the \"expected polynomial time\" in order finding is only locally defined: no global expectation exists once the arithmetic domain expands. The asymptotic vanishing of success probability explains the empirical absence of large-N implementations of Shor's algorithm and sets a fundamental limit on the scalability of quantum factoring.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2511.16956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: In this paper, the initial value problem for the Debye--Hueckel drift-diffusion equation is studied. This equation was introduced as a model describing plasma behavior and is also known as a simulation model of MOSFET, and so its solution describes charge density. It is well-known that, if the initial density is localized, then the density is adjusted to be radially symmetric due to the linear diffusion. Consequently, the electric field is also governed by a radially symmetric potential, and its effects are expected to act radially symmetrically. The main result express the electric field and its effect on the charge density as concrete functions. It also denotes the distortion of symmetry and the shift of scale on the density due to the internal electric field. Unlike the historical paper via Escobedo and Zuazua and the followers, the main result captures stronger nonlinearity than the logarithmic shift.",

By incorporating a broader representation-theoretic perspective, we provide a generalized framework that allows the code designer to take this structure into account. For any representation of a finite group, we produce a quantum code with a code space invariant under the group action, providing passive error mitigation against errors belonging to the image of the representation. Furthermore, errors outside this scope are detected and diagnosed by performing a projective measurement onto the isotypic components corresponding to irreducible representations of the chosen group, effectively generalizing syndrome extraction to symmetry-resolved quantum measurements. We show that all stabilizer codes are a special case of this construction, including qudit stabilizer codes, and show that there is a natural one logical qubit code associated to the dihedral group. Thus we provide a unifying framework for existing codes while simultaneously facilitating symmetry-aware codes tailored to specific systems.",

The analysis focuses on atomic calculations employing noninteger Slater-type orbitals. Analytic derivatives of the energy functional are not readily available for these orbitals. Four methods are investigated under identical numerical conditions: Powell's conjugate-direction method, the Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm, coordinate-based pattern search, and a model-based algorithm utilizing radial basis functions for surrogate-model construction. Performance benchmarking is first performed using the Powell singular function, a well-established test case exhibiting challenging properties including Hessian singularity at the global minimum. The algorithms are then applied to Hartree-Fock-Roothaan self-consistent-field energy functionals, which define a highly non-convex optimization landscape due to the nonlinear coupling of orbital parameters. Illustrative examples are provided for closed$-$shell atomic configurations, specifically the He, Be isoelectronic series, with calculations performed for energy functionals involving up to eight nonlinear parameters.

We present a unified 13-tuple Extended Bio-PN formalism integrating two complementary theories: Weak Independence Theory (enabling coupled parallelism despite place-sharing) and Signal Hierarchy Theory (separating information flow from mass transfer). The extended definition adds signal partition (Psi subset P), arc type classification (A), regulatory structure (Sigma), environmental exchange (Theta), dependency taxonomy (Delta), heterogeneous transition types (tau), and biochemical formula tracking (rho). We formalize signal token consumption semantics through two-phase execution (enabling vs. consumption) and prove weak independence correctness for continuous dynamics. Application to Vibrio fischeri quorum sensing demonstrates how energy metabolism (ENERGY signals) orchestrates binary ON/OFF decisions through hierarchical constraint propagation to regulatory signals (LuxR-AHL complex), with 133-fold difference separating states. Analysis reveals signal saturation timing as the orchestrator forcing threshold-crossing, analogous to bacteriophage lambda lysogeny-lysis decisions.

However, this paradigm faces two critical bottlenecks: the prohibitive memory footprint required for local training on resource-constrained gNBs, and the saturation of bandwidth-limited backhaul links during the global aggregation of high-dimensional model updates. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-Fed, a novel Compression and Combination-based Federated learning framework that unifies local memory efficiency and global communication reduction. Locally, CoCo-Fed breaks the memory wall by performing a double-dimension down-projection of gradients, adapting the optimizer to operate on low-rank structures without introducing additional inference parameters/latency. Globally, we introduce a transmission protocol based on orthogonal subspace superposition, where layer-wise updates are projected and superimposed into a single consolidated matrix per gNB, drastically reducing the backhaul traffic. Beyond empirical designs, we establish a rigorous theoretical foundation, proving the convergence of CoCo-Fed even under unsupervised learning conditions suitable for wireless sensing tasks. Extensive simulations on an angle-of-arrival estimation task demonstrate that CoCo-Fed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both memory and communication efficiency while maintaining robust convergence under non-IID settings.",

In contrast to previous works, in this paper it is assumed that both the number of observation sequences and the number of outlier sequences grow with the sequence length. In this case, the typical distribution $\\pi$ can be estimated by computing the mean over all observation sequences, provided that the number of outlier sequences is sublinear in the total number of sequences. It is demonstrated that, in this case, one can achieve the error exponent of the maximum likelihood test that has access to both $\\pi$ and $\\mu$. However, this mean-based test performs poorly when the number of outlier sequences is proportional to the total number of sequences. For this case, a median-based test is proposed that estimates $\\pi$ as the median of all observation sequences. It is demonstrated that the median-based test achieves again the error exponent of the maximum likelihood test that has access to both $\\pi$ and $\\mu$, but only with probability approaching one. To formalize this case, the typical error exponent -- similar to the typical random coding exponent introduced in the context of random coding for channel coding -- is proposed.",

QEC reduces error rates by encoding logical information across redundant physical qubits, enabling errors to be detected and corrected. A common decoder used for this task is Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) a graph-based algorithm that relies on edge weights to identify the most likely error chains. In this work, we propose a data-driven decoder named Neural Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (NMWPM). Our decoder utilizes a hybrid architecture that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract local syndrome features and Transformers to capture long-range global dependencies, which are then used to predict dynamic edge weights for the MWPM decoder. To facilitate training through the non-differentiable MWPM algorithm, we formulate a novel proxy loss function that enables end-to-end optimization. Our findings demonstrate significant performance reduction in the Logical Error Rate (LER) over standard baselines, highlighting the advantage of hybrid decoders that combine the predictive capabilities of neural networks with the algorithmic structure of classical matching.",

This challenge motivates renewed interest in neuromorphic computing principles, which promise brain-like efficiency through discrete and sparse activations, recurrent dynamics, and non-linear feedback. In fact, modern AI architectures increasingly embody neuromorphic principles through heavily quantized activations, state-space dynamics, and sparse attention mechanisms. This paper elaborates on the connections between neuromorphic models, state-space models, and transformer architectures through the lens of the distinction between intra-token processing and inter-token processing. Most early work on neuromorphic AI was based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for intra-token processing, i.e., for transformations involving multiple channels, or features, of the same vector input, such as the pixels of an image. In contrast, more recent research has explored how neuromorphic principles can be leveraged to design efficient inter-token processing methods, which selectively combine different information elements depending on their contextual relevance. Implementing associative memorization mechanisms, these approaches leverage state-space dynamics or sparse self-attention. Along with a systematic presentation of modern neuromorphic AI models through the lens of intra-token and inter-token processing, training methodologies for neuromorphic AI models are also reviewed. These range from surrogate gradients leveraging parallel convolutional processing to local learning rules based on reinforcement learning mechanisms.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00337v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Composition is a cornerstone of classical differential privacy, enabling strong end-to-end guarantees for complex algorithms through composition theorems (e.g., basic and advanced). In the quantum setting, however, privacy is defined operationally against arbitrary measurements, and classical composition arguments based on scalar privacy-loss random variables no longer apply. As a result, it has remained unclear when meaningful composition guarantees can be obtained for quantum differential privacy (QDP).\n  In this work, we clarify both the limitations and possibilities of composition in the quantum setting. We first show that classical-style composition fails in full generality for POVM-based approximate QDP: even quantum channels that are individually perfectly private can completely lose privacy when combined through correlated joint implementations. We then identify a setting in which clean composition guarantees can be restored. For tensor-product channels acting on product neighboring inputs, we introduce a quantum moments accountant based on an operator-valued notion of privacy loss and a matrix moment-generating function. Although the resulting R\\'enyi-type divergence does not satisfy a data-processing inequality, we prove that controlling its moments suffices to bound measured R\\'enyi divergence, yielding operational privacy guarantees against arbitrary measurements. This leads to advanced-composition-style bounds with the same leading-order behavior as in the classical theory.\n  Our results demonstrate that meaningful composition theorems for quantum differential privacy require carefully articulated structural assumptions on channels, inputs, and adversarial measurements, and provide a principled framework for understanding which classical ideas do and do not extend to the quantum setting.",

For small-scale MIMO-AFDM systems, a tight bit error rate (BER) upper bound associated with the maximum likelihood (ML) detector is derived. By contrast, for large-scale systems, a closed-form BER approximation associated with the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) detector is presented, including realistic imperfect channel estimation scenarios. Our first key observation is that the full diversity order of a hardware-impaired AFDM system remains unaffected, which is a unique advantage. Furthermore, our analysis shows that 1) the BER results derived accurately predict the simulated ML performance in moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while the theoretical BER curve of the LMMSE detector closely matches that of the Monte-Carlo based one. 2) MIMO-AFDM is more resilient to multiplicative distortions, such as phase noise and carrier frequency offset, compared to its orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) counterparts. This is attributed to its inherent chirp signal characteristics; 3) MIMO-AFDM consistently achieves superior BER performance compared to conventional MIMO-OFDM systems under the same additive HWI conditions, as well as different velocity values. The latter is because MIMO-AFDM is also resilient to the additional inter-carrier interference (ICI) imposed by the nonlinear distortions of additive HWIs. In a nutshell, compared to OFDM, AFDM demonstrates stronger ICI resilience and achieves the maximum full diversity attainable gain even under HWIs, thanks to its intrinsic chirp signalling structure as well as to the beneficial spreading effect of the discrete affine Fourier transform.",

To achieve these ambitious goals, key enabling technologies are explored, including digital-twin-based orchestration, low-complexity beam manipulation technologies, all-silicon THz transceivers, and low-complexity analog baseband architectures. Moreover, as future data centers shift toward quantum and chiplet-based modular architectures, THz wireless links provide a flexible mechanism for interconnecting, testing, and reconfiguring these modules. Finally, numerical analysis is presented on the latency and power regimes of THz versus optical and copper interconnects, identifying the specific distance and throughput domains where THz links can surpass conventional wired solutions. The article concludes with a roadmap toward wireless-defined, reconfigurable, and sustainable AI data centers.",

The goal is to find Sidon sets of large size. In this note we show that the graphs of almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions with high linearity can be used to construct large Sidon sets. Thanks to recently constructed APN functions $\\mathbb{F}_2^8\\to \\mathbb{F}_2^8$ with high linearity, we can construct Sidon sets of size 192 in $\\mathbb{F}_2^{15}$, where the largest sets so far had size 152. Using the inverse and the Dobbertin function also gives larger Sidon sets as previously known. Each of the new large Sidon sets $M$ in $\\mathbb{F}_2^t$ yields a binary linear code with $t$ check bits, minimum distance 5, and a length not known so far. Moreover, we improve the upper bound for the linearity of arbitrary APN functions.",

In this scenario, several previous works have shown that the sum capacities of channels involving pseudo-telepathy games can be enhanced by quantum or no-signaling cooperation. However, a full characterization of which channels admit such an improvement remains open. By focusing on the common characteristics of previously studied channels, we propose a broader class of channels for which quantum or no-signaling cooperation increases the sum capacity. Channels in this class are associated with a pseudo-telepathy game, with channel inputs specified as tuples of questions and answers from the game. In addition, when the channel inputs satisfy the winning condition of the game, the channel decomposes into parallel weakly symmetric sub-channels and is less noisy compared to the case when the inputs do not meet the winning condition.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00576v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Light harvesting 2 (LH2) complex is a primary component of the photosynthetic unit of purple bacteria that is responsible for harvesting and relaying excitons. The electronic absorption line shape of LH2 contains two major bands at 800 nm and 850 nm wavelength regions. Under low light condition, some species of purple bacteria replace LH2 with LH3, a variant form with almost the same structure as the former but with distinctively different spectral features. The major difference between the absorption line shapes of LH2 and LH3 is the shift of the 850 nm band of the former to a new 820 nm region. The microscopic origin of this difference has been subject to some theoretical/computational investigations. However, the genuine molecular level source of such difference is not clearly understood yet. This work reports a comprehensive computational study of LH2 and LH3 complexes so as to clarify different molecular level features of LH2 and LH3 complexes and to construct simple exciton-bath models with a common form. All-atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of both LH2 and LH3 complexes provide detailed molecular level structural differences of BChls in the two complexes, in particular, in their patterns of hydrogen bonding (HB) and torsional angles of the acetyl group. Time-dependent density functional theory calculation of the excitation energies of BChls for structures sampled from the MD simulations, suggests that the observed differences in HB and torsional angles cannot fully account for the experimentally observed spectral shift of LH3. Potential sources that can explain the actual spectral shift of LH3 are discussed, and their magnitudes are assessed through fitting of experimental line shapes.",

Starting from a Poisson photon-counting model for bi-exponential fluorescence decays convolved with a finite instrument response function (IRF) and including additive background, we derive FI for both time-binned TCSPC histograms and programmable time-gated acquisitions. To ensure robustness when nuisance parameters such as IRF width, temporal offset, and background level are uncertain, we compute an effective FI using a Schur-complement marginalization and select hardware-feasible temporal designs by maximizing D-optimal criteria over candidate libraries. Across instrument-agnostic simulations spanning IRF broadening and increasing background fractions, FI-driven temporal designs consistently improve photon efficiency relative to uniform sampling, while nuisance-aware planning yields more stable gains under mismatch than naive optimization. Monte Carlo studies with maximum-likelihood estimation confirm that higher effective FI translates into reduced estimator variance and improved parametric map quality at fixed photon budgets. Finally, we map the same FI core to two practical deployment pathways: adaptive re-binning for TCSPC FLIM and adaptive gate placement/width selection for time-gated FLIM, enabling information-theoretic acquisition without hardware modification.",

In this regard, understanding the effects of donor-acceptor quantum coherence and non-Markovian bath, which become significant at short distances, has significant implications. The present work investigates this issue theoretically by comparing results from a theory of coherent RET (CRET) with a nonequilibrium version of F\\\"{o}rster's RET (FRET) theory, both accounting for non-Markovian bath effects. Even for a model where the donor-acceptor electronic coupling is of transition dipole interaction form, it is shown that the RET rate in general deviates from the inverse sixth power distance dependence as opposed to the prediction of the original FRET. It is shown that the donor-acceptor quantum coherence makes the \\re{distance} dependence steeper than the sixth power although detailed manner of enhancement is sensitive to specific values of parameters. On the other hand, the non-Markovian bath effects make the \\re{distance} dependence more moderate than the sixth power for both CRET and nonueqilibrium FRET because finite time scale of the bath causes the rate to be smaller than the prediction of original FRET. While these effects are \\re{demonstrated clearly} in the population dynamics at sub-picosecond time scales, their contributions to the conventional RET efficiency are relatively minor. This indicates that the actual detection of such effects through conventional RET efficiency measurement requires either high precision or utilization of a donor with fast spontaneous decay rate of excitation.",

It is characterized by a high mortality rate and a poor prognosis. In this work, we explore how a clinical oncologist can apply a Stackelberg game-theoretic framework to prolong metastatic prostate cancer survival, or even make it chronic in duration. We utilize a Bayesian optimization approach to identify the optimal adaptive chemotherapeutic treatment policy for a single drug (Abiraterone) to maximize the time before the patient begins to show symptoms. We show that, with precise adaptive optimization of drug delivery, it is possible to significantly prolong the cancer suppression period, potentially converting metastatic prostate cancer from a terminal disease to a chronic disease for most patients, as supported by clinical and analytical evidence. We suggest that clinicians might explore the possibility of implementing a high-level tight control (HLTC) treatment, in which the trigger signals (i.e. biomarker levels) for drug administration and cessation are both high and close together, typically yield the best outcomes, as demonstrated through both computation and theoretical analysis. This simple insight could serve as a valuable guide for improving current adaptive chemotherapy treatments in other hormone-sensitive cancers.",

In many biological and soft-matter systems, distinct components of the medium exhibit unique viscoelastic responses, resulting in time-dependent changes in the observed diffusion exponents. Here, we develop a theoretical model of two particles, each embedded in a distinct viscoelastic medium, and coupled via a harmonic potential. By formulating and solving a system of coupled fractional Langevin equations (FLEs) with memory exponents $0<\\alpha<\\beta\\leq 1$, we uncover rich transient anomalous diffusion phenomena arising from the interplay of memory kernels and bilinear coupling. Notably, we identify recovery dynamics, where a subdiffusive particle ($\\alpha$) transiently accelerates and eventually regains its intrinsic long-time mobility. This recovery emerges only when memory exponents differ ($\\alpha<\\beta$), whereas identical exponents ($\\alpha=\\beta$) suppress recovery. Our theoretical predictions offer insight into experimentally observed transient anomalous diffusions, such as polymer--protein complexes and cross-linked cytoskeletal networks, highlighting the critical role of memory heterogeneity and mechanical interactions in biological anomalous diffusion.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00599v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The efficacy of cryopreservation is constrained by the difficulty of achieving sufficiently high intracellular concentrations of cryoprotective solutes without inducing osmotic injury or chemical toxicity during loading. This thermodynamic study introduces a new conceptual mechanism for cryoprotectant delivery into cells directly or through vascular perfusion. In this framework, effective cryoprotection could be achieved through the in situ generation of high intracellular concentrations of cryoprotective solutes via pressure-activated disassembly of membrane-permeant supramolecular assemblies composed of cryoprotectant monomers or oligomers. These supramolecules, present initially at low concentrations, are envisioned to enter cells through passive partitioning or endocytosis with minimal osmotic effect, and subsequently transform into a high intracellular concentration of cryoprotectants upon disassembly. We propose that elevated hydrostatic pressure, generated intrinsically during isochoric (constant-volume) freezing or applied externally under isobaric (constant-pressure) conditions, can destabilize supramolecular assemblies whose dissociated state occupies a smaller molar volume than the assembled state. Under isochoric freezing, ice formation within a fixed volume produces a substantial pressure increase as a thermodynamic consequence of phase change, rendering pressure a dependent variable governed by the Helmholtz free energy. Under isobaric conditions, pressure acts as an externally controlled variable through the Gibbs free energy. In both formulations, pressure-activated disassembly decouples membrane transport from cryoprotectant availability and enables synchronized solute generation precisely during cooling or freezing, without pre-loading of osmotically active solutes.",

This requirement precluded the application of the method to very long simulations. Here we describe a new variant of the Good-Turing algorithm whose memory requirements scale linearly with the number of structures in the trajectory, making it suitable even for extremely long simulations.

To investigate this discrepancy, we applied a multi-scale computational framework that integrates large-scale sequence analysis of 1000 homologs, coevolutionary interaction mapping, structural community analysis, intrinsic disorder profiling, and adaptive fitness modelling. These analyses converge on a single conclusion: the catalytic core of SHMT forms an exceptionally conserved and tightly coupled structural unit. This region exhibits dense coevolution, strong intramolecular connectivity, minimal disorder, and extremely low mutational tolerance. Peripheral loops and termini, in contrast, are far more flexible. Relative to established folate-pathway antibiotic targets, SHMT active site is even more rigid and evolutionarily constrained. This extreme constraint may limit the emergence of resistance-compatible mutations, providing a plausible explanation for the absence of natural-product inhibitors. Fitness trajectory modelling supports this interpretation, showing that nearly all active-site residues tolerate only rare or neutral substitutions. Together, these findings identify SHMT as a structurally stable and evolutionarily restricted enzyme whose catalytic architecture is unusually protected. This makes SHMT an underexplored yet promising target for the rational design of next-generation antibacterial agents.",

Helmholtz free-energy differences between competing hcp, fcc, and bcc phases are evaluated as functions of electronic temperature up to 7 eV, allowing us to identify solid-solid phase transitions driven by electronic entropy. The systems studied include Zr, Ti, Cd, Zn, Co, and Mg (hcp), Ni, Cu, Ag, Al, Pt, and Pb (fcc), and Cr, W, V, Nb, and Mo (bcc) in their ground-state structures. From the free-energy crossings, we extract the transition electronic temperatures and analyze systematic trends across the metallic systems. We found that all the studied systems go through one or two solid-solid phase transition caused purely by electronic entropy except Mg and Pb. Our results establish electronic entropy as a key factor governing structural stability in metals under strong electronic excitation.",

    "title": "Enhancement of plastic deformation in ultrasound-assisted cold spray of tungsten: a molecular dynamics study",
    "summary": "arXiv:2510.09803v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Tungsten (W) is widely valued for its exceptional thermal stability, mechanical strength, and corrosion resistance, making it an ideal candidate for high-performance military and aerospace applications. However, its high melting point and limited room-temperature plasticity pose significant challenges for processing W using additive manufacturing (AM). Cold spray (CS), a solid-state AM process that relies on high-velocity particle impact and plastic deformation, offers a promising route for additive manufacturing of W, yet conventional CS fails to induce sufficient plastic deformation for effective bonding. In this study, we employ atomistic simulations to investigate the effect of ultrasonic perturbation in enhancing plastic deformation during CS of W, with a focus on acoustoplasticity-driven deformation mechanism. We show that ultrasonic perturbation leads to pronounced acoustic softening and promotes transient temperature elevation at the particle-substrate and particle-particle interfaces, thereby enhancing plastic deformation compared to non-ultrasound-assisted CS. Additionally, our results show that the coupled effects of acoustic softening and enhanced transient thermal activation lead to substantial improvements in interfacial bonding across a wide range of impact velocities, particle sizes, and ultrasonic parameters. Finally, we analyze the feasibility of ultrasound-assisted CS for manufacturing heterogeneous interfaces consisting of an equimolar Vanadium (V)-Tungsten (W) coating on a W substrate. Simulations reveal distinct mechanical behavior and dislocation densities compared to the homogeneous W on W CS configurations. Overall, this work highlights the potential of ultrasound-assisted cold spray as an effective strategy for manufacturing uniform coatings and engineered alloys, thereby addressing critical limitations in the additive manufacturing of refractory metals.",

However, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of BMH systems are often limited by computation, communication, and memory costs. We recently proposed the random batch sum-of-Gaussians (RBSOG) method, which accelerates Coulomb calculations by using a sum-of-Gaussians (SOG) decomposition to split the potential into short- and long-range parts and by applying importance sampling in Fourier space for the long-range part. In this work, we extend the RBSOG to BMH systems and incorporate a random batch list (RBL) scheme to further accelerate the short-range part, yielding a unified framework for efficient simulations with the BMH potential. The combination of the SOG decomposition and the RBL enables an efficient and scalable treatment of both long- and short-range interactions in BMH system, particularly the RBL well handles the medium-range exponential repulsion and dispersion by the random batch neighbor list. Error estimate is provided to show the theoretical convergence of the RBL force. We evaluate the framework on molten NaCl and mixed alkali halide with up to $5\\times10^6$ atoms on $2048$ CPU cores. Compared to the Ewald-based particle-particle particle-mesh method and the RBSOG-only method, our method achieves approximately $4\\sim10\\times$ and $2\\times$ speedups while using $1000$ cores, respectively, under the same level of structural and thermodynamic accuracy and with a reduced memory usage. These results demonstrate the attractive performance of our method in accuracy and scalability for MD simulations with long-range interactions.",

This paper introduces a dual formulation for the PINN framework to improve the reliability of the homogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites, for both strong and variational (weak) formulations. The dual approach facilitates the derivation of guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of PINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material approximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural network-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material discontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs accommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful selection of test functions to avoid instability. Dual formulation serves as a reliable indicator of convergence quality, and its integration into PINN frameworks enhances their applicability to homogenization problems in micromechanics.",

We show that this guarantee does not extend to the asymptotic regime. As N -> infinity, the multiplicative groups Omega_N = (Z/NZ)^x form a non-tight family of probability spaces, and the probability weight associated with successful bases, proportional to p(success | a', N) p(a' | N), decays as 1/phi(N). The ensemble of uniform measures {mu_N} therefore admits no weak limit, implying an asymptotic loss of ergodicity. Monte Carlo simulations up to N <= 10^6 confirm this decay and the absence of a stationary success probability. These results demonstrate that the \"expected polynomial time\" in order finding is only locally defined: no global expectation exists once the arithmetic domain expands. The asymptotic vanishing of success probability explains the empirical absence of large-N implementations of Shor's algorithm and sets a fundamental limit on the scalability of quantum factoring.",

We demonstrate that RPA-based LNO-CC closely matches the performance of its MP2-based counterpart for systems with sizable energy gaps, while delivering significantly faster convergence toward the canonical coupled-cluster limit for metallic systems, particularly as the thermodynamic limit is approached.

To address this challenge, we developed MORE-ML, a computational framework that integrates quantum-mechanical (QM) property data of e-nose molecular building blocks with machine learning (ML) methods to predict sensing-relevant properties. Within this framework, we expanded our previous dataset, MORE-Q, to MORE-QX by sampling a larger conformational space of interactions between BOV molecules and mucin-derived receptors. This dataset provides extensive electronic binding features (BFs) computed upon BOV adsorption. Analysis of MORE-QX property space revealed weak correlations between QM properties of building blocks and resulting BFs. Leveraging this observation, we defined electronic descriptors of building blocks as inputs for tree-based ML models to predict BFs. Benchmarking showed CatBoost models outperform alternatives, especially in transferability to unseen compounds. Explainable AI methods further highlighted which QM properties most influence BF predictions. Collectively, MORE-ML combines QM insights with ML to provide mechanistic understanding and rational design principles for molecular receptors in BOV sensing.

The framework combines: (i) a thermo-mechanical weld process model, and (ii) a coupled deformation-diffusion-fracture phase field-based model that accounts for plasticity and hydrogen trapping, considering multiple trap types, with stationary and evolving trap densities. This enables capturing, for the first time, the interplay between residual stresses, trap creation, hydrogen transport, and fracture. The computational framework is particularised and applied to the study of weld integrity in X80 pipeline steel. The focus is on girth welds, as they are more complex due to their multi-pass nature. The weld process model enables identifying the dimensions and characteristics of the three weld regions: base metal, heat-affected zone, and weld metal, and these are treated distinctively. This is followed by virtual fracture experiments, which reveal a very good agreement with laboratory studies. Then, weld pipeline integrity is assessed, estimating critical failure pressures for a wide range of scenarios. Of particular interest is to assess the structural integrity implications of welding defects present in existing natural gas pipelines under consideration for hydrogen transport: pores, lack of penetration, imperfections, lack of fusion, root contraction, and undercutting. The results obtained in hydrogen-containing environments reveal an important role of the weld microstructure and the detrimental effect of weld defects that are likely to be present in existing natural gas pipelines, as they are considered safe in gas pipeline standards.",

The electronic absorption line shape of LH2 contains two major bands at 800 nm and 850 nm wavelength regions. Under low light condition, some species of purple bacteria replace LH2 with LH3, a variant form with almost the same structure as the former but with distinctively different spectral features. The major difference between the absorption line shapes of LH2 and LH3 is the shift of the 850 nm band of the former to a new 820 nm region. The microscopic origin of this difference has been subject to some theoretical/computational investigations. However, the genuine molecular level source of such difference is not clearly understood yet. This work reports a comprehensive computational study of LH2 and LH3 complexes so as to clarify different molecular level features of LH2 and LH3 complexes and to construct simple exciton-bath models with a common form. All-atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of both LH2 and LH3 complexes provide detailed molecular level structural differences of BChls in the two complexes, in particular, in their patterns of hydrogen bonding (HB) and torsional angles of the acetyl group. Time-dependent density functional theory calculation of the excitation energies of BChls for structures sampled from the MD simulations, suggests that the observed differences in HB and torsional angles cannot fully account for the experimentally observed spectral shift of LH3. Potential sources that can explain the actual spectral shift of LH3 are discussed, and their magnitudes are assessed through fitting of experimental line shapes.",

In this regard, understanding the effects of donor-acceptor quantum coherence and non-Markovian bath, which become significant at short distances, has significant implications. The present work investigates this issue theoretically by comparing results from a theory of coherent RET (CRET) with a nonequilibrium version of F\\\"{o}rster's RET (FRET) theory, both accounting for non-Markovian bath effects. Even for a model where the donor-acceptor electronic coupling is of transition dipole interaction form, it is shown that the RET rate in general deviates from the inverse sixth power distance dependence as opposed to the prediction of the original FRET. It is shown that the donor-acceptor quantum coherence makes the \\re{distance} dependence steeper than the sixth power although detailed manner of enhancement is sensitive to specific values of parameters. On the other hand, the non-Markovian bath effects make the \\re{distance} dependence more moderate than the sixth power for both CRET and nonueqilibrium FRET because finite time scale of the bath causes the rate to be smaller than the prediction of original FRET. While these effects are \\re{demonstrated clearly} in the population dynamics at sub-picosecond time scales, their contributions to the conventional RET efficiency are relatively minor.

MS-iQCC addresses this challenge by simultaneously optimizing multiple electronic states in a single, state-averaged procedure that treats ground and excited states on equal footing. This removes the energetic bias that is introduced when excited states are computed one at a time and constrained to remain orthogonal to previously optimized states. The approach supports multireference electronic structure by allowing multideterminantal initial guesses and by adaptively building a compact exponential ansatz from a pool of qubit excitation generators.

Yet, the technique inherently convolutes the molecular response with a strong, energy-dependent tunneling background, complicating the isolation of the true ELA. We introduce synchronous differential HotES (sd-HotES), defined as the ratio of the differential conductance of the hot-charge and tunneling channels of the HotES. Physical modeling and numerical simulations validate that this ratio directly reconstructs the intrinsic molecular charge transmission, enabling the threshold-free and probe-bias-insensitive extraction of ELA. By effectively eliminating the masking tunneling background, sd-HotES substantially boosts detection sensitivity; weak spectral features previously hidden in conventional HotES become clearly resolvable, as demonstrated in lock-in simulations including realistic noise. This study establishes the fundamental operating principles of sd-HotES and highlights it as a powerful, broadly applicable strategy for accessing buried interface properties for the study of molecular and hybrid devices.",

To investigate this discrepancy, we applied a multi-scale computational framework that integrates large-scale sequence analysis of 1000 homologs, coevolutionary interaction mapping, structural community analysis, intrinsic disorder profiling, and adaptive fitness modelling. These analyses converge on a single conclusion: the catalytic core of SHMT forms an exceptionally conserved and tightly coupled structural unit. This region exhibits dense coevolution, strong intramolecular connectivity, minimal disorder, and extremely low mutational tolerance. Peripheral loops and termini, in contrast, are far more flexible. Relative to established folate-pathway antibiotic targets, SHMT active site is even more rigid and evolutionarily constrained. This extreme constraint may limit the emergence of resistance-compatible mutations, providing a plausible explanation for the absence of natural-product inhibitors. Fitness trajectory modelling supports this interpretation, showing that nearly all active-site residues tolerate only rare or neutral substitutions. Together, these findings identify SHMT as a structurally stable and evolutionarily restricted enzyme whose catalytic architecture is unusually protected.

However, real-world agents may participate in a diversity of interactions, not all of which present dilemmas. We develop an evolutionary game model on multilayer networks in which one layer supports the prisoner's dilemma game, while the other follows constant-selection dynamics, representing biased but non-dilemmatic competition, akin to opinion or fad spreading. Our theoretical analysis reveals that coupling a social dilemma layer to a non-dilemmatic constant-selection layer robustly enhances cooperation in many cases, across different multilayer networks, updating rules, and payoff schemes.

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00707v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We study self-organization in a minimally nonlinear model of large random ecosystems. Populations evolve over time according to a piecewise linear system of ordinary differential equations subject to a non-negativity constraint resulting in discrete time extinction and revival events. The dynamics are generated by a random elliptic community matrix with tunable correlation strength. We show that, independent of the correlation strength, solutions of the system are confined to subsets of the phase space that can be cast as time-varying Gardner volumes from the theory of learning in neural networks. These volumes decrease with the diversity (i.e. the fraction of extant species) and become exponentially small in the long-time limit. Using standard results from random matrix theory, the changing diversity is then linked to a sequence of contractions and expansions in the spectrum of the community matrix over time, resulting in a sequence of May-type stability problems determining whether the total population evolves toward complete extinction or unbounded growth. In the case of unbounded growth, we show the model allows for a particularly simple nonlinear extension in which the solutions instead evolve towards a new attractor.",

    "title": "Functional Group Identification from Infrared Spectra via a Dual-Head Convolutional Network",
    "summary": "Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is widely used for molecular characterization, yet automated functional group identification remains challenging due to spectral overlap, weak absorptions, and context-dependent vibrational features. In this work, we present a dual-head convolutional neural network for multi-label functional group identification directly from single infrared spectra. The proposed architecture captures complementary local and global spectral information through parallel convolutional pathways with cross-scale alignment. The model is evaluated on NIST-derived gas-phase IR datasets covering 21 functional groups using five-fold cross-validation. It achieves a mean macro-averaged F1 score of 0.9169, indicating improved performance across functional groups. In addition to the overall results, the proposed architecture shows improved recognition for several challenging functional groups, as reflected by per-class evaluation and ablation analysis. Overall, this work provides a scalable baseline for IR-based functional group identification and clarifies both the capabilities and current limitations of single-modality infrared analysis, offering a foundation for future extensions toward multi-modal spectroscopic learning approaches.",

    "summary": "Although a wide variety of functional materials based on cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) have been developed, fabricating CNF/nanoparticle hybrid materials remains challenging because nanoparticles readily aggregate into large clusters. In this study, we report the fabrication of CNF scaffolds decorated with Ag nanoparticles via a post-reduction strategy that suppresses nanoparticle aggregation during the reduction process. CNF gels were fabricated by combining freeze-casting and freeze-crosslinking of an aqueous CNF dispersion, resulting in networked structures whose morphology was controlled by the freezing conditions. Unidirectionally and radially aligned CNF-networked gels exhibited characteristic mechanical properties corresponding to their orientation. Ag+ cations were subsequently incorporated into the CNF networks, and freeze-drying yielded Ag+-loaded CNF scaffolds as precursors for electrically conductive porous materials. Thermal reduction of these precursors successfully produced electrically conductive CNF scaffolds with a well-dispersed state of Ag nanoparticles. In contrast, severe nanoparticle aggregation was observed when Ag+ cations were reduced with ascorbic acid under wet conditions prior to freeze-drying. This post-reduction strategy effectively suppressed Ag nanoparticle aggregation, leading to well-dispersed CNF/Ag networked structures and significantly improved electrical conductivity.",

    "summary": "Silylene transfer reaction, which allows single-step formation of two silicon-containing -bonds, have attracted much attention in synthetic organosilicon chemistry, whereas its development has been significantly hampered by the lack of synthetically viable, readily accessible silylene precursors. We herein report a new silylene transfer reaction (STR) using aryldiorganosilanes (ArR1R2SiH) as silylene precursors,  in which a silylene unit is inserted into the O\u2013C(sp2) bond of unsaturated oxacycles, such as benzofurans, was enabled by iridium catalysts with extrusion of Ar\u2013H as the only byproduct. A variety of silylenes, including diaryl, (aryl)(alkyl), dialkyl, and even (aryl)(alkoxy)silylene units, are transferred to give ring-enlarged oxasilacycles. This protocol is extended to the germylene transfer reaction using Ph3GeH as a source of diphenylgermylene (Ph2Ge:). The new STR is not limited to benzofurans containing various functional groups, but applicable to furans, 1,4-benzodioxin, dihydrofuran, dihydropyran, and even acyclic enol ether. The complete STR process consists of two sequential STRs, i.e., intermolecular STR into the C(sp2)\u2013H bond  to the oxygen atom, followed by intramolecular STR into the C\u2013O bond. Formal silicon atom transfer is demonstrated using PhSiH3 as a source of the silicon atom, which in the first step undergoes cyclative double C\u2013H silylation, followed by the present Ir-catalyzed STR with benzofuran. Using a 5-(2-diphenylhydrosilylethyl)benzofuran as a monomer, silylene transfer polymerization has been demonstrated.",

    "summary": "Accurate prediction of chemical reaction barrier heights is crucial, yet traditional quantum mechanical methods are computationally expensive, and existing deep learning models often rely on costly three-dimensional transition state geometries or struggle with out-of-distribution generalization. This work introduces ReactFormer, a novel deep learning framework designed to predict reaction barrier heights with high accuracy solely from two-dimensional molecular graphs of reactants, thus eliminating the need for explicit transition state information. ReactFormer employs a reaction-aware graph Transformer architecture, which includes multi-view reactant encoding and a unique Virtual Reaction Center Node, enabling it to effectively capture complex reaction features and implicitly infer transition state characteristics. Evaluated on the RDB7 dataset, ReactFormer achieves a Mean Absolute Error of 2.40 $\\pm$ 0.12 kcal/mol on the random split, matching or even slightly surpassing the performance of three-dimensional dependent models. Furthermore, ReactFormer demonstrates significantly improved computational efficiency and robust generalization across various out-of-distribution scenarios, including splits based on molecular size, target barrier height, reaction core, and reactant scaffold. An ablation study confirms the critical contributions of its core components. ReactFormer represents a significant step towards efficient, accurate, and generalizable deep learning models for chemical reaction dynamics, fostering advancements in drug discovery, materials science, and catalysis.",

Here, we develop MAPLE, a program specifically designed for MLFF-based molecular modeling, featuring a tailored framework and parallelized algorithms. In this study, we demonstrate the robustness and usability of MAPLE through systematic benchmarking of modern reactive MLFFs and applications to multiple biocatalytic scenarios, highlighting its capability for fast yet accurate simulation of catalytic reactions. By leveraging the accuracy and efficiency of MLFFs together with a highly optimized and flexible software framework, MAPLE serves as a next-generation, physically informed, machine-learning\u2013driven molecular modeling platform with broad applicability to rational catalyst design and drug discovery.",

    "title": "Detection of 1-Hydroxypyrene as biomarker for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons via cyclodextrin-based systems",
    "summary": "1-Hydroxypyrene (1HOPy) is the major urinary metabolite of pyrene and one of the most widely used biomarkers for assessing human exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Despite its analytical relevance, the molecular determinants governing the interaction of 1HOPy with supramolecular hosts in aqueous solution remain poorly understood. In this work, we present a combined spectroscopic and computational investigation of the binding of 1HOPy to \u03b2-cyclodextrin (\u03b2CD), \u03b3CD (\u03b3CD), hydroxypropyl-\u03b2CD (HP\u03b2CD), dimers of \u03b2CD  and two polymers with the aim of elucidating the structural and thermodynamic factors underlying complex formation. Steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, and time-resolved fluorescence measurements reveal distinct binding behaviours depending on the host architecture. While \u03b2CD, HP\u03b2CD and the dimers predominantly form 1:1 complexes with 1HOPy, \u03b3CD displays cooperative binding, giving rise to both 1:1 and 2:2 host\u2013guest assemblies. In the polymers 2 CDs tend to encapsulate the 1HOPy guest. Spectroscopic signatures further indicate that, under buffered conditions, partial formation of the enolate form of 1HOPy may contribute to enhanced stabilization in one dimer. Binding constants differ even by 2 orders of magnitude with HP\u03b2CD displaying the highest affinity followed by one dimer.\nTo rationalize these observations at the molecular level, extensive molecular dynamics simulations combined with thermodynamic integration (TI) were performed. Computational models were designed to reflect the experimentally relevant stoichiometries while also probing alternative binding scenarios to explain deviations from experimental fits. Structural analyses based on RMSD, minimum host\u2013guest distances, hydrogen-bond patterns, and clustering reveal that \u03b2CD dimers remain relatively flexible and poorly compacted upon guest binding, whereas \u03b3CD undergoes pronounced guest-induced dimer stabilization. In particular, inclusion of two 1HOPy molecules drives the compaction of the otherwise labile \u03b3CD dimer, leading to a rigid and cooperative supramolecular assembly.\nBinding free energies computed by TI reproduce the experimental hierarchy of affinities and highlight that interaction energies alone do not predict thermodynamic stability. For \u03b2CD systems, strong local host\u2013guest interactions translate only into moderate binding free energies, whereas \u03b3CD exhibits a marked amplification of affinity arising from cooperative host\u2013host reorganization. Comparison between calculated and experimental free energies shows overall agreement, while also delineating specific deviations attributable to chemical effects not explicitly captured by the classical force-field description.\nOverall, this study demonstrates that 1HOPy not only acts as a passive guest but can actively stabilize supramolecular architectures, particularly in \u03b3CD systems. These findings provide molecular-level insight into cyclodextrin\u2013PAH metabolite recognition and support the rational design of cyclodextrin-based platforms for the detection and sensing of environmental biomarkers.",

Combining insights from these components through multiomics data integration enhances the depth and nuance of biological understanding available from these measurements. Among methods that integrate data across different technologies (e.g. mass spectrometry, sequencing), those that link components based on biological prior knowledge\u2014pathway analyses\u2014represent the most direct way of translating molecular-level observations into meaningful biological insights. However, significant barriers exist that prevent full utilization of metabolomics and especially lipidomics data in pathway integration. Challenges include the fast turnover and complex interactions of small molecules compared to biological macromolecules, low metabolite annotation rates, isomerism among lipids, and a lack of lipid representation in existing pathway knowledge bases. While these issues stem from a variety of causes, improvements to multiomics pathway integration including better incorporation of lipids into pathway knowledge bases and increased adoption of artificial intelligence approaches can greatly enhance the utility of small molecule -omics data, particularly for lipidomics. Here we describe the current landscape of multiomics integration tools with an emphasis on support for metabolomics and lipidomics data, we highlight their capabilities and gaps with tangible examples using real multiomics data, and provide our perspective on how these approaches can be improved to better support generation of useful biological insights from complex multiomics data",

    "summary": "Staphylokinase (SAK) is a highly fibrin-specific plasminogen activator with significant potential as a safe and affordable thrombolytic. Yet, its clinical translation can be limited by potential immunogenicity. To accelerate the development of improved thrombolytics, a critical step is identifying the most suitable molecular template. Therefore, we performed a comparative analysis of biochemical and immunological properties of three engineered low-immunogenic variants (SAK SY155, SAK THR174, and SAK STAR FRIDA) and two wild-types (SAK STAR and SAK 42D), using a newly established panel of assays. All variants retained potent thrombolytic activity, with SAK SY155 displaying the highest catalytic efficiency and fibrin-clot permeability. However, this advantage did not fully translate into improved clot reduction under flow conditions. Comprehensive immunological profiling, including monocyte activation, T lymphocyte proliferation, dendritic cell maturation, and mouse immunization models, revealed no strong immunogenic response in any tested variant. Overall, low-immunogenic SAK SY155 and its background wild-type SAK STAR emerged as the most promising templates for rational engineering of next-generation thrombolytics.",

    "summary": "Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is secreted from the intestinal L cells in a glucose-dependent manner. However, the mechanism underlying how glucose stimulates the secretion remains unclear. Here, we found that glucose at postprandial concentrations near the Km of GK for glucose (~10 mM), as well as nonmetabolizable glucose analogs, triggers GLP-1 secretion by intestinal L cells through directly binding to glucokinase (GK), without increasing intracellular ATP levels. We also show that in postprandially high glucose, glucose-bound GK interacts and inhibits KATP, as assessed by immunoprecipitation and FRET-FLIM analyses, as well as patch clamping. In addition, we have utilized GK mutants identified in diabetics, demonstrating that those mutants defective in binding to glucose impair GLP-1 secretion in however high glucose, whereas mutants constitutively bound to glucose with defects in catalysis, promote GLP-1 secretion even in low glucose. Furthermore, the KATP mutant unable to bind to GK blocks GLP-1 secretion in high glucose. We have also provided evidence showing that sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) plays an important role in the basal secretion of GLP-1, but not in high glucose. We have thus revealed that glucose the molecule itself and GK act as a ligand and the receptor, respectively, to induce GLP-1 secretion in response to high glucose, providing new therapeutic avenues targeting metabolic diseases.",

We present a dense slowness-shift imaging method that estimates local speed-of-sound changes from ultrasound B-mode images using optical flow. This single-transducer, image-based approach enables mapping of spatial temperature change without requiring additional hardware. Cryoablation experiments in a tissue-mimicking phantom and ex vivo turkey breast demonstrated that slowness deviation increases with decreasing temperature. In the phantom, the dependence was linear (a = -20.70 s{middle dot}m-1C{degrees}-1), while in turkey breast it presented an exponential relationship (t = 34.04xexp(0.075(-{Delta}T)) s{middle dot}m-1C{degrees}-1). The algorithm detected sub-degree temperature variations and accurately tracked cooling down to -39.4 {+/-} 5.6 {degrees}C.

    "title": "Decoupled Representation Learning Improves Generalization in CRISPR Off-Target Prediction",
    "summary": "Computational prediction of CRISPR-Cas9 off-target activity is a critical step toward the safe and scalable design of guide RNAs. Most existing deep learning models are trained on large proxy datasets derived from high-throughput assays; however, their performance often degrades when evaluated on experimentally validated off-target sites. This limitation raises concerns about the generalization ability of proxy-trained models and highlights the need for architectures that better transfer to biologically relevant benchmarks such as TrueOT. We propose a two-stage deep learning framework that decouples sequence representation learning from off-target classification. In the first stage, guide RNA sequences are encoded using pretrained transformer-based embeddings learned from large genomic corpora. In the second stage, a hybrid neural network integrates these embeddings with mismatch-level and sequence-pair features to predict off-target activity. Models are trained exclusively on a proxy dataset and evaluated under strict external validation on the TrueOT benchmark. Our results show that incorporating pretrained sequence embeddings substantially improves generalization performance. The full two-stage model achieves consistent improvements in ROC-AUC and PR-AUC on TrueOT, relative to proxy-only baselines, across repeated runs. We demonstrate a consistent generalization effect under distribution shift, robust to training noise, seeds, and evaluation variance. These findings provide empirical evidence that representation transfer plays a critical role in bridging the gap between proxy assay data and experimentally validated off-target behavior.",

    "title": "The Influence of Ligands on AlphaFold3 Prediction of Cryptic Pockets",
    "summary": "Cryptic pockets are binding sites that are formed or exposed upon a conformational change. They represent an important class of potentially druggable binding sites. Reliably predicting cryptic pockets capable of binding ligands, however, remains a challenge. Herein we examine the use of AlphaFold 3 (AF3) for generating realistic conformational ensembles that include known cryptic pockets. We find that AF3 is generally able to reproduce the scale of conformational change required for cryptic site formation. When given a cryptic-site ligand for the protein, AF3 predominantly predicts conformations competent to bind the ligand in the cryptic site; without the ligand, conformations lacking the cryptic pocket generally dominate. While the results may reflect a bias toward memorized structural priors, the level of detrimental memorization appears to be limited. We also show that the choice of the ligand can significantly impact the predictions, and that AF3 is able to produce models with the ligand correctly positioned. Variability in ligand position, however, suggests that generating ensembles of co-folded predictions is critical to enhancing the likelihood of obtaining a correct binding mode. Overall, AF3-generated protein-ligand structural ensembles have potential utility in cryptic-site drug discovery, and they can reveal ligands likely to bind to those sites.",

However, most deep learning approaches that use KGs in biomedicine remain task-specific, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse applications within a unified framework. Here, we introduce NetMedGPT, a transformer-based foundation model trained on a large-scale biomedical KG using masked token prediction. By learning contextualized representations of biomedical nodes, NetMedGPT enables unified, zero-shot inference across different drug discovery tasks. Specifically, in five tasks, i.e., predicting the association of drugs with indications, targets, adverse drug reactions, contraindications, and off-label uses, NetMedGPT consistently outperforms all specialized baselines, achieving area under the precision-recall curve gains of between 2.2% and 26%. When evaluated on independent external datasets, NetMedGPT outperformed baseline on an expert-curated clinical indications set and also preferentially prioritized clinically relevant drug-disease pairs in ClinicalTrials.gov. NetMedGPT's generative capability further supports the construction of mechanistically plausible subnetworks offering biological insights. NetMedGPT provides a unified foundation model for network medicine that supports scalable hypothesis generation and provides potential to accelerate drug repurposing.

    "summary": "Evolutionary pressure on microbial communities propagating under extreme environmental conditions often results in unique structural adaptations to promote cell survival. Here, we report an investigation of AbpX, a biomatrix protein identified in cultures of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrodictium abyssi. Under ex vivo and in vitro conditions, AbpX assembles into a para-crystalline lattice composed of semiflexible fibrils. CryoEM analysis of recombinant AbpX fibrils reveals that the precursor protein polymerizes through donor strand complementation (DSC), a process previously reported for chaperone-usher fimbriae in Gram-negative bacteria. Unlike the latter DSC protein polymers, AbpX undergoes chaperone-free polymerization in the presence of calcium ions, which are sequestered at the donor strand-acceptor groove interface between protomers in the fibril. Using a combination of cryoEM and crystallographic structural information, an atomic model is proposed for the AbpX lattice that provides insight into its potential role in biofilm formation. These findings suggest that calcium ion coordination triggers fibril assembly and pre-organizes the fibrils for incorporation into the protein lattice. Bioinformatic analysis indicates that AbpX exemplifies a distinct and broadly distributed clade of calcium ion responsive biomatrix proteins within the TasA superfamily that can be fabricated into hydrogel biomaterials in vitro under environmentally benign conditions.",

    "title": "Polymer Concentration Induced Self-assembly of Block Copolymers in Ionic Liquid Smart Inks",
    "summary": "Assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) with epoxy is useful to enhance the mechanical toughness of 3D-printable epoxy inks. Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) like 1-Ethyl-3-Methylimidazolium dicyanamide ([EMIM][DCA]) have enhanced the self-assembly of pure BCP, enabling the formation of a controlled nanostructure. However, the mechanistic details of the morphological transitions of BCP to nanostructures in the presence of ILs remain unresolved. Here, we developed a coarse-grained (CG) model for a certain class of BCPs, namely Pluronic P123 in [EMIM][DCA] ionic liquid, to investigate the underlying mechanism beyond nanostructure transition of BCPs under varying temperature and composition. At various Pluronic compositions (20-60 wt%), P123 self-aggregates into spherical, cylindrical, and lamellar nanostructures, confirmed by visual inspection and quantitative metrics. An increase in the concentration of Pluronic leads to the formation of a more favorable self-interaction, resulting in a more ordered, lamellar-shaped aggregate. We suggest that morphological changes of nanostructure are governed by the balance between entropic and enthalpic factors. In a higher ordered shape (lamellar phase), enthalpic dominates, while in spherical-shaped micelles, both entropic and enthalpic are equivalent. Our CG model of PEO and PPO beads can be used to investigate the BCPs phase separation and will further help to understand the thermodynamics of self-aggregation for other BCPs in IL medium. This study will guide the acceleration of the discovery process for advanced 3D printable materials, including Pluronic P123 or other Pluronic materials.",

Incorporation into PCL films transforms the rapid, minute-scale NO release of the powders into sustained release profiles lasting up to 24 h in biologically relevant media.

    "summary": "All solid-state batteries (ASSBs) based on solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are a novel Li-ion battery technology with the potential of enhanced safety, longer lifetimes, and increased energy density when coupled with the Li-metal anode. Li-Argyrodite (Li6PS5Cl) is a promising SSE with high ionic conductivity, produced using cheap and sustainable precursors, and therefore of interest to both academia and industry. Like many other sulfide-based SSEs, it is however unstable against Li-metal. Using ab-initio and machine-learning methods, we simulate three representative Li-metal/Li-Argyrodite interface models to investigate whether the exact surface termination affects the chemical stability and ion transport capability. We present a systematic approach to create low-energy interfaces by screening 28 low Miller-index surface terminations of Li-argyrodite and coupling them with Li-metal. Custom-made machine-learned interatomic potentials trained on ab-initio data enable the simulation of large interface models with over 2000 atoms for 5 ns. We find that all three interfaces decompose into an amorphous solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, consisting of Li3P, Li2S and LiCl, which then crystallizes into an antifluorite phase Li2S{1-x-y}P{x}Cl{y}; {x,y = 0.14-0.15}. A two orders of magnitude decrease in Li-ion flux shows that the crystalline SEI layer is a sluggish ion conductor, similar to Li2S. While all three interfaces form the same crystalline SEI layer, the exact rates of the decomposition and crystallisation depend on the actual surface composition. These atomic-level insights could potentially be used to control the SEI formation in sulphide-based SSEs and others.",

Although [6+4] pericyclic reactions of tropone derivatives and dienes have been investigated since the mid 1960s, little work has been performed to look at the factors that may affect the energy barriers of both the forward and reverse reaction. In this work, we use DFT calculations and experimental analyses to examine the cycloaddition reactions of tropone derivatives with dienes. We find that DFT calculations at the m062x-6-31G(d) level of theory are consistent with experimentally derived values of  \u0394G\u2021 for the reactions of some tropone derivatives with cyclopentadiene. Likewise, calculations provide reasonable predictions of the distribution of [6+4] and competitive [4+2] adducts, with [6+4] adducts converting to the more stable [4+2] adducts at elevated temperatures. Finally, we observe that even the rather stable [4+2] adducts show some reversion to the starting tropone. Due to the alignment between calculations and experimental kinetic and thermodynamic data, this work highlights the value of employing DFT methods in the future to help in the design of new reversible cycloadditions.",

    "summary": "Aramid fiber (AF) reinforced epoxy resin (EP) composites are widely regarded as promising candidates for fabricating advanced composites. However, the inherently weak interfacial adhesion between AF and EP considerably restricts the overall performance of AF/EP composites. Therefore, the effective interfacial optimization of is crucial for realizing high-performance AF/EP composites. In this work, an amino-terminated hyperbranched polyimide (HBPI) was synthesized via low-temperature solution polycondensation and utilized as a novel AF sizing agent. Thereafter, the AF/EP interfacial interactions were enhanced through the combined effects of chemical bonding between the HBPI sizing agent and EP and physical interactions (hydrogen bonding and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions) between HBPI sizing agent and AF, thereby benefiting stress transfer at the interfacial region. As a result, the 90\u00b0 tensile strength and NOL-ring interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of AF0.04/EP composites (with a 0.04 wt% HBPI sizing concentration) were improved by 38.45% and 14.31%, respectively, compared with the AFunsized/EP specimen. Furthermore, the tensile strength and elongation at break of the impregnated filament increased by 17.86% and 14.73%, respectively. These findings demonstrate that the HBPI sizing agent offers significant potential for enhancing the interfacial performance of AF/EP composites, providing valuable theoretical insights for the development of high-performance composite materials.",

    "title": "A Computational/Experimental Investigation into the Reversibility of [6+4]/[4+2] Cycloadditions with Tropone Derivatives",
    "summary": "While the thermoreversibility of furan-maleimide Diels\u2013Alder adducts has been employed in dynamic polymer networks, the susceptibility of furans and maleimides to engage in irreversible side reactions motivated our investigations into other dynamic cycloaddition reactions.  Although [6+4] pericyclic reactions of tropone derivatives and dienes have been investigated since the mid 1960s, little work has been performed to look at the factors that may affect the energy barriers of both the forward and reverse reaction. In this work, we use DFT calculations and experimental analyses to examine the cycloaddition reactions of tropone derivatives with dienes. We find that DFT calculations at the m062x-6-31G(d) level of theory are consistent with experimentally derived values of  \u0394G\u2021 for the reactions of some tropone derivatives with cyclopentadiene. Likewise, calculations provide reasonable predictions of the distribution of [6+4] and competitive [4+2] adducts, with [6+4] adducts converting to the more stable [4+2] adducts at elevated temperatures. Finally, we observe that even the rather stable [4+2] adducts show some reversion to the starting tropone. Due to the alignment between calculations and experimental kinetic and thermodynamic data, this work highlights the value of employing DFT methods in the future to help in the design of new reversible cycloadditions.",

    "summary": "TiO2\u2013reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrids were investigated in this study to elucidate how TiO2 morphology and surface chemistry govern charge-transfer pathways and, ultimately, reaction selectivity. Three anatase TiO2 nanostructures were compared: bipyramids predominantly exposing {101} facets (bipy) and two nanosheet-like samples enriched in {001} facets, either fluorinated (n-sh) or thermally defluorinated and {101}-enriched (n-sh_873K). A constant rGO loading (2 wt.%) was introduced via in situ hydrazine reduction of graphene oxide in the presence of TiO2. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated under Xe-lamp irradiation in two model reactions probing oxidative and reductive pathways: phenol degradation and H2 evolution using formic acid as a scavenger. rGO systematically enhanced phenol degradation for all morphologies, with bipy+rGO showing the highest activity. In contrast, H2 evolution was consistently suppressed upon rGO incorporation across all TiO2 samples, although the bipyramidal morphology remained the most active within each series.\nThese results highlight that facet exposure and surface functionalization dictate the beneficial or detrimental role of rGO depending on the targeted photocatalytic pathway.",

    "summary": "All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) attracted increasing attention due to their improved safety and energy densities; yet electrolyte decomposition and subsequent contact loss limited the interfacial stability of ASSBs. Herein, we report an operando Raman characterization that provides high voltage, time, and spatial resolutions, which enables simultaneous analysis of interfacial decomposition mechanism and morphological evolution. Using Na3SbS4 electrolyte (NSS) and its carboxymethyl-cellulose-encapsulated analogue (NSS-CMC) as exemplars, we precisely contrasted the subtle differences in the two-step reduction mechanism of the two electrolytes. In both systems, Na3SbS3 formed as an intermediate, and Na3Sb binary as one major final product; while the CMC coating altered the kinetics of Na3SbS3 formation and consumption, and extended the formation potential of Na3Sb from 1.35 V (seen in NSS) to 0.50 V (vs. Na/Na+). Oxidation of NSS and NSS-CMC both occur near 2.20 V, although CMC coating altered the crystallinity of the oxidative products. Simultaneously, we captured phenomena that are unique to solid-state electrochemical systems such as particle relocation, morphological change, and reversed reactions. We inferred CMC\u2019s dual role as a voltage barrier and a mechanical buffer in suppressing the electro-chemo-mechanical decomposition of NSS electrolyte. The deep mechanistic insights unravel the exact modification needed for improved interfacial stability.",

    "summary": "Lead-free potassium-sodium niobate (K0.5Na0.5NbO\u2083, KNN) ceramics represent a promising alternative to replace lead-based piezoelectrics in energy harvesting and actuator applications due to their high Curie temperature and favorable ferroelectric properties. This study investigates the structural, dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties of pure KNN and multi-element doped compositions: (K0.4Na0.48Bi0.1La0.02)(Nb0.9Ti0.1)O3 (KNN-BiLaTi) and (K0.4Na0.56La0.02Y0.02)(Nb0.9V0.05Sb0.05)O3 (KNN-LaYVSb), synthesized via conventional solid-state methods. Structural analysis (XRD/Rietveld) revealed single-phase orthorhombic perovskite structures (space group Amm2) for all samples, with no detectable secondary phases. XPS, Raman, SEM, and TEM revealed that the dopants tune defect chemistry, suppress surface alkali degradation, and refine the microstructure, especially in dense, low-porosity KNN-LaYVSb, which has pronounced lattice distortion for favorable domain wall motion. Dielectric experiments demonstrated lower orthorhombic\u2013tetragonal transition temperatures and wider, more diffuse phase transitions. However, Curie temperatures remained high, indicating reliable operation over a wide range of temperatures. At optimal poling, KNN-LaYVSb attained the highest piezoelectric coefficient (d\u2083\u2083 = 221 pC/N) and excellent thermal stability up to 275 \u00b0C, retaining over 90% of room-temperature value and over 80% at elevated temperatures near 450 \u00b0C. The improved temperature stability arises from diffuse phase transitions, defect-dipole stabilization, and nanoscale heterogeneity due to multi-element doping. The remnant polarization increased from 3.49 \u00b5C/cm\u00b2 (Pure-KNN) to 25.3 \u00b5C/cm\u00b2 (KNN-LaYVSb) with significantly reduced coercive field (6.10 kV/cm). These findings illustrate that selective multi-element co-doping at A- and B-sites effectively modifies polymorphic phase boundaries near room temperature by improving defect chemistry through controlled vacancy formation and optimizing microstructure. This results in robust, high-performance lead-free piezoceramics for advanced energy harvesting and sensing applications operating across wide temperature ranges.",

    "summary": "Nitrogen heterocycles are integral part of pharmaceuticals, catalysts, and materials, yet most accessible molecular scaffolds remain flat, aromatic rings with limited three-dimensionality. As medicinal chemistry increasingly seeks non-planar, sp3-rich architectures to improve molecular performance and to expand underexplored chemical space, methods that can remodel existing heterocycles into new 3D frameworks are urgently needed. Here we introduce a fundamentally new strategy for ring insertion that uses simple nucleophilic reagents - most notably, Grignard reagents - to introduce one-carbon  into azolium rings. This unprecedented nucleophilic rearrangement converts planar triazolium salts, derived from alkenes, into a previously inaccessible family of saturated, three-dimensional 1,2,4-triazinanes. The method is operationally simple, broadly applicable to cyclic, acyclic, natural, and highly functionalized alkenes, and remarkably tolerant of sensitive groups including esters, amides, sulfonamides, acetals, phosphates, and alkynes. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory computations reveal a unique nitrenium-centered pathway that enables this umpolung reactivity. By transforming readily available olefins into complex, non-planar nitrogen heterocycles in just two steps, this work provides a powerful entry into new heterocyclic space and opens opportunities for late-stage diversification relevant to drug discovery, catalysis, and molecular design.",

    "summary": "In a Perspective article titled \"Mind the Gap!\", Bredas clarifies the distinction between different uses of the term  \"band gap\" in the context of experimentally measured or computationally evaluated energy gaps. In view of the tremendous progress in atomically precise metal nanoclusters where electrochemical and optical energetics are routinely supported by computations to establish structure-function correlations, we explore the relationship between different protocols for measuring and computing band gaps of two distinct organic ligand-protected nanoclusters: [Cu14H10(MBN)3(PPh3)8]+ and Au20(TBBT)16. Through UV/visible spectroscopy and differential pulse voltammetry, we measure optical and electrochemical band gaps in those systems. We then compare these experimental gaps to HOMO-LUMO gaps, fundamental gaps, vertical excitation energies, and Eox - Ered potentials computed using density functional theory (DFT) or time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT). We test functionals with varying degrees of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange from 0% to 50%, different correlation functionals, basis sets, and (equilibrium and non-equilibrium) continuum solvation models. We find that in both copper and gold nanoclusters, the most important factor affecting the magnitude of the band gap is the % HF exchange, which in the case of the HOMO-LUMO gap can vary by several eV. This sensitivity is partially mitigated when computing the fundamental, optical, and electrochemical gaps. The second most important factor is the proper description of solvation effects. Other factors, such as the nature of the correlation functional, basis set, and geometry relaxation, have a considerably smaller effect on computed band gaps in these systems. Overall, this work provides generalizable guidelines on factors at varied importance for correlating computed and experimental \"band gap\" values.",

The selectivity of this process depends strongly on the nature of substituents in hydrazine. Aryl hydrazines bearing electron-rich and electron-neutral aromatic groups form six-membered rings by attacking the cyclopropane via the NH group, while the NH2 group reacts in hydrazines equipped with electron-withdrawing aromatic substituents, \tacyl hydrazines, and carbazates. In both scenarios, the initial products of nucleophilic ring opening undergo in situ Lewis acid-induced cyclization, providing important azaheterocyclic systems in a single synthetic step; further transformations enable access to other valuable products. The proposed mechanism of the title process and the observed chemoselectivity switch have been explained by both experimental and computational studies.",

    "title": "Non-covalent inter-chain interactions dictate single chain encapsulation behavior of pnictogen chalcogenides within van der Waals nanotubes",
    "summary": "A fully developed understanding of the chemistry that governs interactions in low-dimensional materials is essential to realizing control over their structure, nanoscale morphology, and distinct physical properties. Yet, precisely achieving this in extended solids comprised of highly polarizable main group elements has remained a grand challenge especially in one-dimensional materials that approach the atomic scale. This is owing to the propensity of these heavy main group elements to drive the unusual localization or delocalization behavior of electrons in the system and the formation of competing metastable polytypes due to lone pair effects. In this report, we establish the composition-dependent encapsulation behavior of single chains derived from the low-dimensional Pn2Ch3 pnictogen chalcogenide class (Pn = Sb, Bi; Ch = S, Se, Te) and their strong dependence on the strength of inter-chain non-covalent interactions. Using Sb2S3 and Bi2S3 as model phases, we find that the degree of pnictogen (Pn) bonding is a significant factor in dictating the packing of the constituent quasi-1D chains in the bulk and their growth behavior as single chains upon encapsulation within single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Specifically, chains with weaker inter-chain interactions like Sb2S3 preferentially crystallize under slow-cooled growth parameters that resemble more thermodynamically preferred conditions while chains with stronger inter-chain interactions like Bi2S3 prefer to crystallize and isolate as bulk and only form the elusive encapsulated clustered and crystalline chain domains under rapidly quenched conditions. Systematic Sb/Bi alloying of the precursors revealed the pnictogen-dependence of the chain crystallization where Sb-rich alloys tend to more preferentially crystallize within SWCNTs. In these alloys, Bi preferentially occupies the peripheral three-coordinate site to maximize inter-chain interactions in the bulk, while Sb preferentially occupies the same site when encapsulated within SWCNT and devoid of chains adjacent to it. These results demonstrate that non-covalent bonding concepts in molecular main group systems track in low-dimensional solids that approach the atomic regime when encapsulated within nanotubes, marking a significant step forward in the rational and predictable encapsulation of all-inorganic chains within confined spaces.",

    "summary": "In this review we present eMap 2.0, a web-based application for predicting electron/hole transfer pathways in proteins and protein families based on their structures. The underlying model can be viewed as a coarse-grained version of the Pathways approach by Beratan and Onuchic [Beratan et al. J. Chem. Phys. 1987, 86, 4488]. Similar to the original framework, eMap employs graph-theory algorithms to search for the most efficient electron transfer pathways as shortest paths on a graph representation of the protein. What distinguishes eMap from the original formulation is that the nodes represent electron transfer active sites instead of atoms and only through-space tunneling is considered for each individual electron/hole hop. eMap 2.0 takes one step further by aiming at identifying shared electron transfer pathways in protein sets. From a graph theory standpoint, this is achieved using frequent subgraph mining (FSM) algorithms. Lastly, eMap 2.0 utilizes sequence and structural similarity measures to analyze and cluster the results. Here, we show how this robust method can be utilized to rapidly provide insights regarding conserved electron transfer pathways within protein families and to identify outliers in protein families, in which the conserved electron transfer pathway is blocked either by a mutation or conformational changes.",

    "summary": "Ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) excitation has emerged in recent years as a powerful modality in organic synthesis, namely for the generation of heteroatom-centered radicals through formal met-al-ligand bond homolysis from the LMCT excited state. However, exploitation of alternative LMCT excited state processes has been extremely limited. Here, we describe a general strategy for tuning the reaction course from LMCT excited states of titanium alkoxides. This reactivity paradigm has been exploited for tandem \u03b2-scission/Giese addition reactions of both scission-amenable and scis-sion-recalcitrant alcohols under divergent reaction pathways of met-al-ligand bond homolysis and excited state \u03b2-scission through judicious choice of electronically tuned Ti catalysts. Through intramolecular competition studies, catalyst-controlled scission is shown to facilitate a rate enhancement of up to 103-fold over the intrinsic scission of free alkoxyl radical, highlighting the impact of accessing the excited state scission paradigm. Computations support the relevance of a scission-promoting LMCT excited state with stereoelectronically aligned alkoxyl radical cation character to enable direct, selective \u03b2-scission.",

The selectivity of this process depends strongly on the nature of substituents in hydrazine. Aryl hydrazines bearing electron-rich and electron-neutral aromatic groups form six-membered rings by attacking the cyclopropane via the NH group, while the NH2 group reacts in hydrazines equipped with electron-withdrawing aromatic substituents, \tacyl hydrazines, and carbazates. In both scenarios, the initial products of nucleophilic ring opening undergo in situ Lewis acid-induced cyclization, providing important azaheterocyclic systems in a single synthetic step; further transformations enable access to other valuable products. The proposed mechanism of the title process and the observed chemoselectivity switch have been explained by both experimental and computational studies.",

    "title": "Leveraging Divergent LMCT Excited State Pathways for Catalyst Control over Alkoxyl Radical Reactivity",
    "summary": "Ligand-to-metal charge-transfer (LMCT) excitation has emerged in recent years as a powerful modality in organic synthesis, namely for the generation of heteroatom-centered radicals through formal met-al-ligand bond homolysis from the LMCT excited state. However, exploitation of alternative LMCT excited state processes has been extremely limited. Here, we describe a general strategy for tuning the reaction course from LMCT excited states of titanium alkoxides. This reactivity paradigm has been exploited for tandem \u03b2-scission/Giese addition reactions of both scission-amenable and scis-sion-recalcitrant alcohols under divergent reaction pathways of met-al-ligand bond homolysis and excited state \u03b2-scission through judicious choice of electronically tuned Ti catalysts. Through intramolecular competition studies, catalyst-controlled scission is shown to facilitate a rate enhancement of up to 103-fold over the intrinsic scission of free alkoxyl radical, highlighting the impact of accessing the excited state scission paradigm. Computations support the relevance of a scission-promoting LMCT excited state with stereoelectronically aligned alkoxyl radical cation character to enable direct, selective \u03b2-scission.",

    "title": "Length vs Velocity Gauge Formulation of the Frequency-Dependent Polarizability for 1D Periodic Systems at Coupled Cluster with Single and Double Excitations Level",
    "summary": "This work presents the implementation of the linear response function for 1D periodic systems at coupled cluster with single and double excitations with periodic boundary conditions level (LR-CCSD-PBC) for the calculation of the frequency-dependent electric dipole-electric dipole polarizability tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}(\\omega)$, with the modified velocity gauge (MVG) formalism. We compare this approach with the length gauge (LG) formalism that we presented in a previous work [APL Comp. Phys. 1, 026107 (2025)] in terms of theoretical analysis and computational results. Calculations on molecular systems with large Dunning basis sets including diffuse functions show a smooth convergence towards the complete basis set limit (CBS) with both formalisms, but LG and MVG converge to different values when CCSD provides an incomplete treatment of electron correlation. With the  small basis sets used in the PBC calculations, the difference between the gauge formalisms increases due to basis set incompleteness. For the PBC calculations on 1D periodic systems, the MVG formalism shows a faster convergence towards the thermodynamic limit with $k$ sampling compared to LG. Furthermore, the MVG formalism provides perfect agreement between PBC and long molecular cluster models. This is not the case for LG due to the so-called missing integer issue. However, a comparison with the molecular data suggests that the LG-PBC results with the small basis set affordable in this work are closer to the CBS results than those with MVG. This work represents a further step forward for the simulation of optical response properties for solid-state materials with systematically improvable quantum mechanical methods.",

    "summary": "The study of artwork is an interesting field that has undergone a major turn the last decades as new scientific analysis methods have been introduced and is becoming a significant part of the investigations. In this study we have employed Raman spectroscopy to analyse the pigments in an old painting of the Roman Emperor Domitian. The painting is of special interest since its creation is historically attributed to Tiziano Vecellio, more known as Titian, but it has recently been found to contain a signature that reads L daVinci. We here perform a rigorous pigment analysis of the painting and signature area to identify and classify the pigments by usage and the potential time of deployment. Microscopic cut outs from selected areas of the painting were analysed in a Raman microscope where 14 different pigments were identified. Out of these, 12 pigments were contemporary with Titian (1488/90-1567) and Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), one pigment, titanium white, was present during the Middle Ages but came into common use at a later time and one pigment, Prussian blue, is of newer origin. Complimentary X-ray imaging shows that at least one of the areas where Prussian blue was found has likely been altered at a later stage, providing an explanation for the presence of a modern pigment in an old painting. Special emphasis was also applied to resonant and non-resonant Raman response of Prussian green and blue, expressing different ratios of Fe2+ and Fe3+ states, valuable for identification and discrimination of the compounds in pigment identification and in the more recent field of battery research.",

    "summary": "Electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO\u2083RR \u2192 NH\u2083) suffers from poor selectivity and strong competition from hydrogen evolution. Here we show that materials-intrinsic electrostatic reprogramming of colloidal copper nitride (Cu\u2083N) nanocrystals provides a robust lever to bias NO\u2083RR. Two routes are established in a single electrolyte (0.50 M KNO\u2083 + 0.10 M KOH): (i) dilute Na incorporation that preserves the anti-ReO\u2083 (Pm-3m) lattice with small peak shifts, and (ii) Li treatment that amorphizes Cu\u2083N, yielding short-range\u2013ordered Li\u2013Cu\u2013N. Across both families, cyclic voltammetry, LSV/Tafel analysis, and impedance spectroscopy reveal earlier cathodic onset (\u224860\u2013120 mV), reduced charge-transfer resistance (R_ct down to ~16 \u03a9 from ~79 \u03a9 for pristine), and favorable potential-of-zero-charge (PZC) shifts within the operating window.

    "title": "Crystal Growth, Structures and Optical Bandgaps of Cuprous Rare-Earth Molybdates",
    "summary": "Cuprous-oxide semiconductors have been growing in research interest because of their promising optical and catalytic properties for solar energy conversion. While much recent research has focused on binary and ternary cuprous oxides, the more structurally complex quaternary and higher systems remain significantly less explored. Crystal growth in the cuprous rare-earth (RE) molybdate system has been investigated using high temperature and arc-melting synthesis techniques. Prior studies show the formation of two closely related compounds in these systems, occurring as either Cu6RE4(MoO4)9 (Space group: R3c, No. 161; exclusive for RE = La) or CuRE(MoO4)2 (Space group: Pbca, No. 61; for R = Nd and heavier REs). By contrast, our new synthetic investigations for RE = Ce and La demonstrate the crystallization of both structure types, i.e., as red-colored crystals of Cu6RE4(MoO4)9 (RE = La(1) or Ce(2)) and as yellow-colored crystals of CuRE(MoO4)2 (RE = La(3) or Ce(4)), as obtained by slow cooling from 950 oC and from arc-melting techniques, respectively. Both structures similarly consist of [MoO4]2- tetrahedra bridged either by highly-distorted CuO4 tetrahedra and CeO9 tricapped trigonal prisms in 1 and 2 or by T-shaped CuO3 and CeO8 square antiprisms in 3 and 4. Optical UV-Vis diffuse reflectance measurements on powders of CuRE(MoO4)2 for RE = La, Ce, Sm, Eu, and Yb show relatively larger direct bandgaps in the range of 2.36 to 2.47 eV, while the crystals of Cu6RE4(MoO4)9 for RE = La and Ce yield smaller indirect bandgaps of about 1.89 to 2.05 eV. Electronic structure calculations show bandgaps which stem predominantly from electronic transitions between the filled 3d10-based orbitals of the Cu(I) cations and the empty d-based orbitals of the Mo(VI) cations. Thus, the RE cations are found to have an indirect effect on the optical bandgaps via changes in the local coordination environments of each of these cations. The change in crystal structure, such as from Cu6Ce4(MoO4)9 to CuCe(MoO4)2, has a dramatically larger effect of decreasing the bandgap by ~0.4 to 0.5 eV as compared to only changing the RE cation within the same structure type. In summary, new synthetic investigation of the quaternary cuprous molybdates has elucidated the impact of RE cations on their crystal structures, compositions, and visible-light bandgaps, with the underlying relationships revealed via electronic structure calculations.",

Combined with differently sized complete active space approaches (CASSCF), this method enables a decomposition of the magnetic coupling constant J into its underlying physical contributions. Herein, we extend the VIEH framework to complexes with multiple magnetic coupling pathways. This approach is showcased with a homologous series of [M2(\u03bc\u2212O)(NH3)n]2+ complexes including Cu(II), Ni(II), and Fe(II). Typically, antiferromagnetic coupling progressively weakens from copper to nickel and iron. We demonstrate that this weakening arises primarily from an increase in the ferromagnetic coupling contribution across this series.",

    "summary": "ATG2A transfers glycerophospholipids from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to support expansion of the isolation membrane at ER membrane contact sites. While a role for ATG18/WIPI4 in targeting ATG2A to the IM is well established, how ATG2A is recruited to the ER remains unclear. In this study, we found that MOSPD3, an atypical VAP family protein, acts an adaptor that recruits ATG2A to the ER. MOSPD3 colocalizes with ATG2A and is specifically enriched at ER sites juxtaposed with the IM during autophagosome formation. Recruitment is mediated by direct interactions between the FFNT (two phenylalanines in a neutral tract) motif in the N-terminal region (NT) of ATG2A and the major sperm protein (MSP) domain of MOSPD3. Co-expression of MOSPD3 with ATG2A-NT, but not a MOSPD3-binding-defective mutant ATG2A-NT-T362A, markedly rescued the autophagic defect caused by ATG2A/B double knockout (DKO). MOSPD3 depletion abolishes ATG2A recruitment to the ER and impedes autophagic flux. Together, this study demonstrates that MOSPD3 functions as an ER adaptor for ATG2A in autophagy.",

    "summary": "Nipah virus (NiV) represents a catastrophic public health risk to the Indian subcontinent, as evidenced by recurring outbreaks in Kerala (2018, 2021, 2023) where case fatality rates reached as high as 70-90%. There are currently no clinically approved therapeutics or vaccines specifically for NiV. A major hurdle in the drug development pipeline is the high mutation rate of RNA viruses, which allows them to rapidly evolve resistance against site-specific inhibitors. This research project utilizes a multi-layered computational strategy to identify a small-molecule inhibitor capable of targeting the viral polymerase while maintaining efficacy against the predicted high-probability W730A resistance mutation. Through a first-principles assessment of the viral polymerase structure (PDB: 9KNZ), I established a design constraint called Allosteric Independence. This requires any lead candidate to bind in a pocket that is geometrically distinct from the mutation site W730, thereby preventing steric or electronic disruption upon mutation. After screening a library of 50 high-potential candidates using a rigid-receptor docking protocol, I identified BMS-986205 (Linrodostat), an investigational IDO1 inhibitor, as a superior lead. BMS-986205 demonstrated a binding affinity of -7.17 kcal/mol against the wild-type polymerase and a paradoxical increase to -7.29 kcal/mol against the W730A mutant. Geometric analysis confirmed a physical separation of 6.28 \u00c5 from the mutation site. Given its current status in global Phase 3 clinical trials for oncology, BMS-986205 is a primary candidate for rapid drug repurposing to secure India\u2019s population against future outbreaks.",

    "title": "MINT32: A Minimum-Image INT32 Coordinate Representation for Fast and Accurate Molecular Dynamics on GPUs",
    "summary": "Molecular dynamics simulations on GPUs have historically required a trade-off between performance and numerical precision. Mixed-precision approaches, such as AMBER SPFP and OpenMM, accumulate forces in high precision while representing coordinates in single precision (FP32). This design introduces a fundamental \u201cnoise floor\u201d: quantization error in FP32 coordinates injects artificial heat into the system, degrading long-term stability and distorting kinetic properties.\n\nWe introduce MINT32, a coordinate representation that maps the simulation box onto a 32-bit integer grid. MINT32 achieves a spatial resolution of approximately 0.01 fm, roughly 300 times finer than FP32, without the memory bandwidth penalties associated with 64-bit integer arithmetic. In addition, MINT32 offers algorithmic elegance through self-wrapping, whereby periodic boundary conditions are enforced via exact integer overflow, eliminating branch divergence entirely.\n\nBenchmark results demonstrate that MINT32 reduces energy drift in microcanonical (NVE) simulations by nearly an order of magnitude (7--10x), delivering double-precision-level stability for challenging PME water systems. When paired with single-precision force evaluations, MINT32 outperforms conventional mixed-precision models, indicating that coordinate precision is the dominant factor governing simulation stability in the systems examined. The fixed-point grid further enables constraint solvers (SHAKE) to converge to tolerances of 10A, effectively eliminating constraint instabilities. Our implementation achieves approximately 85\\% of production throughput on consumer-grade GPUs, serving as a conceptual foundation for future molecular dynamics (MD) engines.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to identify an optimal coordinate representation for next-generation MD software.

    "title": "Computational Discovery of BMS-986205 as a Resistance-Proof Inhibitor for the Nipah Virus Polymerase",
    "summary": "Nipah virus (NiV) represents a catastrophic public health risk to the Indian subcontinent, as evidenced by recurring outbreaks in Kerala (2018, 2021, 2023) where case fatality rates reached as high as 70-90%. There are currently no clinically approved therapeutics or vaccines specifically for NiV. A major hurdle in the drug development pipeline is the high mutation rate of RNA viruses, which allows them to rapidly evolve resistance against site-specific inhibitors. This research project utilizes a multi-layered computational strategy to identify a small-molecule inhibitor capable of targeting the viral polymerase while maintaining efficacy against the predicted high-probability W730A resistance mutation. Through a first-principles assessment of the viral polymerase structure (PDB: 9KNZ), I established a design constraint called Allosteric Independence. This requires any lead candidate to bind in a pocket that is geometrically distinct from the mutation site W730, thereby preventing steric or electronic disruption upon mutation. After screening a library of 50 high-potential candidates using a rigid-receptor docking protocol, I identified BMS-986205 (Linrodostat), an investigational IDO1 inhibitor, as a superior lead. BMS-986205 demonstrated a binding affinity of -7.17 kcal/mol against the wild-type polymerase and a paradoxical increase to -7.29 kcal/mol against the W730A mutant. Geometric analysis confirmed a physical separation of 6.28 \u00c5 from the mutation site. Given its current status in global Phase 3 clinical trials for oncology, BMS-986205 is a primary candidate for rapid drug repurposing to secure India\u2019s population against future outbreaks.",

    "summary": "Selective synthetic routes to prepare boronic esters are highly desirable as they are valuable intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional materials. In this paper, we report a new approach to generate boronic esters through the ring-opening hydroboration of benzylidene cyclobutanes catalysed by magnesium(II) complexes. For the first time, products were accessed through the selective hydroboration of a single C\u2013C sigma-bond of the cyclobutane ring with complete chemoselectivity and high E:Z selectivities (99:1 to 3:1) across a wide range of substrates. The mechanism is proposed to proceed through the hydromagnesiation of the benzylidene cyclobutane, ring-opening by beta-alkyl migration, and subsequent Mg-to-B metathesis. Probe experiments, 11B NMR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations suggest that boronate complexes play a role in catalytic turnover, and that ring-closed hydroborated species form as off-cycle intermediates. The new process represents an important example in which a sustainable and inexpensive magnesium catalyst performs in an entirely complementary manner to transition metal systems.",

    "summary": "The increasing importance and predictive power of modern molecular modeling, driven by physics- and machine learning-based methods, necessitates a new collaborative architecture to replace the isolated, traditional model of software development. The traditional approach often led to redundant engineering effort, high costs, and opaque systems that limit reproducibility, independent scrutiny, and scientific independence.  \n\nThis perspective advocates for permissively licensed open source software as a scientific and economic multiplier by reducing the duplication of effort, enabling scientific validation of modeling tools, and frictionless experimentation with new ideas. Coordinated, multi-project consortia, such as Open Force Field, Open Free Energy, OpenFold, and OpenADMET have formed to collaboratively build shared computational infrastructure and release all methods under permissive licenses. The success of these large-scale efforts requires organizational structures that extend beyond code. The Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF), a US nonprofit, serves as a domain-specific institutional home and fiscal sponsor. By providing governance, administrative infrastructure, and dedicated research software engineers, OMSF aligns incentives across academic and industrial stakeholders.

    "summary": "Vitrimers are the new class of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) capable of topological rearrangement through dynamic bond exchange, enabling recyclability, self-healing and stress relaxation while maintaining network integrity. The ring opening of epoxides by carboxylic acids is a fundamental epoxy\u2013acid esterification reaction underlying vitrimer network formation, yet its atomistic mechanism remains challenging to simulate as experimental time scales for crosslinking reactions in polymers range from minutes to hours\u2014far beyond the reach of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this work, we employ biased MD using the Collective Variables (COLVARS) module in LAMMPS combined with a reactive ReaxFF potential to promote the ring-opening reaction between Diglycidyl Ether of Bisphenol A (DGEBA) and oxalic acid. Three coupled collective variables were designed to represent epoxide C\u2013O bond cleavage, C(epoxide)\u2013O(acid) bond formation, and proton transfer between acid and epoxide oxygens. This external bias promotes nucleophilic addition of acid-derivedcarboxylate oxygen to the epoxide carbon, resulting in ring opening, followed by proton transfer to yield the \u03b2-hydroxy ester functionality characteristic of vitrimer networks. This method allows simulating cross-linking at realistic, low, temperatures which helps to mimic chemical reactions and avoids unwanted high-temperature side reactions. Since not all accelerated events lead to the desired product, careful selection of initial configurations, molecular orientations, and suitable external bias parameters increases the probability of meaningful simulation results. Furthermore, the stability of the resulting vitrimer was evaluated in the absence of any external bias, and its thermomechanical properties were subsequently analyzed. Results show that the biased MD approach successfully captures the atomistic steps of the esterification reaction and the resulting vitrimer network can be used for accurate prediction of thermomechanical properties.",

In the absence of enzymes, Ni\u2013MOFs exhibited a typical compact, closed morphology, whereas enzyme-assisted synthesis produced well-defined microsnowflake-like structures. The formation process was rapid, and extended synthesis times did not induce changes in the final morphology. Notably, the enzyme structure played a key role in determining the final architecture; the use of larger enzymes, such as catalase, resulted in the formation of a sandwich-like layered structure. Structural characterization confirmed the formation of a porous material with an average pore size of revealing an average pore diameter ranging from 3 to 6 nm and pore volumes between 0.17 and 0.22 cm\u00b3/g .  Also Ni-ELFs hybrid showed  surface area from 82 of m\u00b2/g  to 139 m\u00b2/g (for Ni-ELF 1). Fluorescent labeling of the protein allowed the localization of the enzyme within the flake-like structures, revealing its preferential distribution at the periphery while leaving the central region accessible, thereby generating a novel hierarchical hybrid porous material.\nTo evaluate catalytic efficiency, ELFs were tested in hydrolytic reactions as esterase/lipase-mimic catalysts. In this context, Ni-based ELFs outperformed free lipases with ELF-1 exhibiting the highest catalytic activity compared to other ELF hybrids. As a proof of concept for hydrolysis-mimic plastic degradation, ELF-1 demonstrated notable activity in the direct degradation of PET bottle fragments into microstructured products.",

    "title": "Sequence-controlled Rapid Living Anionic Copolymerization of Polystyrene Derivatives Using a Flow Microreactor",
    "summary": "Copolymers play a vital role in a diverse array of functional materials, where their properties are determined by both their molecular weight and monomer sequence. While precise molecular weight control has been achieved in anionic polymerization reactions, sequence control remains a major challenge, particularly in fast copolymerization reactions that occur on the millisecond (ms) timescale. This limitation arises because conventional in situ spectroscopic analyses fail to capture such rapid kinetics in polar solvents, and existing quenched-flow setups are too complex for practical use. Here, we report a modular flow- microreactor platform that enables both kinetic analysis and sequence control in a fast, living anionic copolymerization reaction. By exploiting ms-scale mixing and quenching, we determined the propagation rate constants for the copolymerization of styrene and tert-butoxystyrene using the Beckingham\u2013Sanoja\u2013Lynd model, providing the first quantitative kinetic insight into such a rapid anionic system. Furthermore, by controlling the monomer feed based on the obtained rate constants, we achieved the synthesis of pseudo-random, gradient, and block copolymers. The pseudo-random copolymer exhibits low glass-transition temperatures and high solubility. This work provides a practical and quantitative approach for analyzing ms-scale polymerization processes and offers a general platform that combines reaction kinetics with polymer-sequence design, thus opening new opportunities for the rational development of functional materials through living anionic polymerization.",

    "summary": "Embedding mechanophores into polymer matrices to activate mechanochemical reactions has been extensively employed to realize diverse functional applications. Spiropyran (SP) is a widely used mechanophore that undergoes force-induced isomerization into its activated merocyanine (MC) form, accompanied by a color change. To accurately simulate the SP-MC isomerization process under tension, the present work introduces a large-scale hybrid coarse-grained/atomistic (CG/AA) model in which poly(methyl metacrylate) (PMMA) monomers are represented by in dividual beads, while SP remains fully described at the AA level. We used force field parameters derived from quantum chemical (QC) data, employing the fully atomistic framework previously developed by our group. The underlying CG PMMA force field was reparameterized to match experimental bulk properties and compared with a corresponding atomistic force field. This approach enabled deformation simulations of significantly larger systems than possible with a pure AA force field, at reduced computational cost, thereby providing novel insights into force transduction and mechanophore activation. Furthermore, a parabolic stress distribution was observed along individual PMMA chains, resulting in preferential SP activation near chain centers. Non specific chain scission events occurred far less frequently than SP activations. The developed hybrid model offers a powerful framework for investigating more complex mechanophore doped polymer networks.",

    "summary": "Electrons have internal structure, you cannot have spin without internal structure, you  cannot have chemistry without spin, computing with out an explicit model for spin has  made chemists\u2019 lives hard.  We present a deterministic framework for computational chemistry that replaces the  probabilistic wave function with a classical electromagnetic model of the electron possessing  internal temporal structure. By recognizing the electron as a half-photon electromagnetic  field configuration oscillating between two temporal poles separated by \u03b40 = \u03bbC /2 \u22481.21  pm, we resolve the classical radiation catastrophe and recover atomic stability without quan-  tum axioms. The electron\u2019s energy resides entirely in the half-photon field oscillation at  frequency \u03c90 = mec2/\u210f, not in electrostatic self-energy of the temporal poles. Angular mo-  mentum conservation (L= \u210f) makes the electron stiff against stretching but compressible  under strong nuclear fields, with compression energy E(\u03b4) = \u210fc/\u03b4 increasing hyperbolically  as \u03b4 < \u03b40. This temporal structure naturally regularizes the nuclear Coulomb potential,  predicting the hydrogen ground state to 0.18% accuracy. The exchange interaction emerges  as magnetic phase-locking between antiparallel electron pairs, calibrated from Cooper pair  coherence lengths in superconductors. This mechanism reproduces the lithium ionization  energy (0.8% error) and derives nitrogen\u2019s sp3 geometry from magnetic dipole packing con-  straints. The Pauli exclusion principle arises from two physical mechanisms: (1) compressed  electrons cannot phase-lock with uncompressed electrons due to frequency mismatch, and  (2) half-photon analytic paths resist spatial overlap. The model offers O(N2) computational  scaling for molecular systems, presenting a classical alternative to density functional theory.",

    "title": "Photochemical post-functionalization of polystyrene enables accelerated chemical recycling",
    "summary": "The development of molecular post-modification design strategies that enable low-temperature pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) remains an underexplored area. The current state of the art for the pyrolysis of PS demands heating above 400\u00b0C which creates economic barriers to commercial-scale monomer recovery. Here, we demonstrate the post-functionalization of the PS backbone with a labile C-S bond, specifically a trifluoromethylthio group (SCF3), to accelerate the depolymerization of PS at lower temperatures. We first adapted the trifluoromethylthiolation reaction to PS which involved solvent screening and reaction optimization. We observed a significant increase in the depolymerization of PS-SCF3 compared to PS across a wide range of molecular weights and consumer-grade products at 300\u00b0C. Using the Flynn-Ozawa-Wall analysis, the average apparent activation energy for the depolymerization of PS-SCF3 is ~11kJ/mol lower than pristine PS. To benchmark this protocol, we found that the pyrolysis of several consumer-grade PS-SCF3 samples at 300\u00b0C offered greater amounts of styrene compared to pristine consumer-grade PS. This study explores the possibilities of post-functionalizing the backbone of PS to depolymerize PS at faster timescales and lower temperatures to afford greater recovery of styrene, contributing towards a circular economy of plastics.",

    "title": "Chromosome-na\u00efve global networks of initiators of hybrid assembly pathways of endogenous multiprotein complexes.",
    "summary": "Molecular mechanisms governing initiation steps of the assembly of thousands of endogenous multi-protein complexes (EMCs) remain incompletely understood. Here, multiple lines of observations are reported reflecting the biological functions-aligned initiation sequence of hybrid assembly pathways (HAPs) of EMCs. HAPs postulate the creation of cell type-specific intracellular pools of hetero- and homodimers as the first step of chain reactions of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of EMCs\u2019 assemblies. The consensus action sequence of HAPs consists of: a) Initiation on genomic DNA templates of the formation of metastable hetero- and homodimers of EMCs\u2019 protein constituents; b) Release of dimers from DNA templates for delivery to the EMCs assembly compartments; c) Assembly of defined EMCs by sequential on demand addition to preformed dimers serving as attractors of EMC-specific monomers\u2019 ensembles. Chromosome-na\u00efve scaffolds of PPIs contributing to creation of intracellular dimer pools constitute genome-wide networks of binding sites for 716 transcription factors (TFs), 534 of which manifest patterns of significantly enriched expression in 1358 brain regions. The initiators\u2019 loci of HAPs appear to operate within nucleosome-depleted islands of transposable elements (TE) \u2013 derived sequences within transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. Performance of PPI DNA template-guided assembly lines of EMCs is illustrated in two concurrent modes of PPI cascades: TF-TF PPI chains and TF-PPI Hub protein chains. Regardless of the number of DNA-bound TFs initiating the multistep PPI sequences at PPI initiators (ranging from one to 716 TFs), both modes of operations reached the equilibrium at the PPI constituents saturation levels of ~245 proteins for TF-TF PPI and of ~351 proteins for TF-PPI Hub Proteins\u2019 assembly chains. Regardless of TF panels bound at HAP initiators, proteins of PPI-guided ensembles are enriched in either defined sets of neuroanatomical structures (TF-TF PPI path) or among structural-functional constituents of synapses (PPI Hub proteins path). Examples of default operation modes of DNA-template-guided assemblies of hetero- and homodimers of Yamanaka factors, neurogenesis constituents, and principal protein components of postsynaptic density of excitatory and inhibitory synaptogenesis are reported. Altogether, this contribution reports the foundational evidence for further experimental and theoretical explorations of retrotransposon-seeded genome-wide codes for initiators of PPI chain reactions of protein dimerization creating pools of attractors to guide and accelerate the EMC assemblies.",

    "title": "Effect of PEG Chain Length on the Water Solubility of Monodisperse PEG-Appended Molecules",
    "summary": "Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a nonionic and highly water-soluble polymer, and PEGylation is widely used as a versatile chemical strategy to enhance the water solubility of otherwise poorly soluble molecules. The rational design of PEG-appended materials, therefore, requires an estimation of the PEG chain length necessary to achieve the desired level of solubility. Here, we investigated the relationship between the PEG chain length and the water solubility of PEG-appended molecules using a combination of experimental and computational approaches. We focused on monodisperse PEG with a discrete molecular weight, which enables us to identify the relationship between chain length and physicochemical properties, as represented by water solubility. Then, we designed a series of PEG\u2011appended molecules bearing monodisperse PEG chains of varying lengths, and measured their water solubilities experimentally. In parallel, molecular dynamics-based alchemical free\u2011energy calculations yielded thermodynamic trends that reproduced the observed dependence of solubility on PEG chain length. Comparison of experimental and computational results showed that the calculations not only distinguished between water-soluble and insoluble PEG-appended molecules but also captured the solubility trends for moderately soluble species. These findings demonstrate the potential of molecular-dynamics-based free-energy calculations for a priori prediction of the water solubility of PEG-appended molecules.",

Notably, the Red box displays greater selectivity for c-MYC over duplex DNA compared to the well-characterized porphyrin TMPyP4 and its macrocyclic architecture is essential for this activity, as its acyclic analogue displays negligible G4 stabilization. In cellular assays, treatment with non-cytotoxic concentrations of the Red box selectively downregulated c-MYC expression in HEK293T cells, with minimal effects on c-KIT and hTERT. Furthermore, c-MYC suppression was proportional to its basal expression across several cell lines, supporting a G4-mediated mechanism.",

Intriguingly, we witnessed multi-level PL fluctuations (flickering) in \nindividual green-emitting CsPbBr3 microrods. Wide-field PL microscopy reveals that the \nintensity fluctuations are nearly identical along the microrod, owing to charge carrier migration,  \nand waveguide\u2011assisted propagation. Our measurements on single microrod suggests that the \nflickering dynamics is strongly influenced by excitation power, excitation energy, and local \nenvironmental constituents. Under dry argon environment, a sharp reduction in the PL intensity \nis observed, indicating the formation of large number of nonradiative (NR) centers which \nquenches all the photogenerated carriers, suppressing overall emission intensity and PL \nflickering. The exposure of oxygen passivates these NR traps generated under argon, while \nhumidity introduces metastable photoinduced NR traps (\u201cspecial quenchers\u201d) that govern the \nenhanced flickering behaviours. Our findings establish that spatiotemporally correlated \nintermittency is not limited to organometallic perovskites but extends to all-inorganic \nperovskite bulk emitters as well and provides new insights into the role of transient defects and \natmospheric constituents in dictating emission stability.",

    "summary": "Successive maturation of ribosomal subunits occurs through multi-layered phase-separated structures of the cell nucleolus. The spatio-functional relationship between transcription of rRNA and nucleolar substructures and how this adapts to cellular stress remain incompletely understood. In this study, we resolve the sub nucleolar structures using expansion microscopy to reveal ordered structures of fibrillar center (FC) and dense fibrillar component (DFC) domains as nested shells, which is reorganized upon cellular stress like DNA damage or RNA polymerase I (RNAPI) inhibition. Direct visualization of nascent (5' ETS) and mature (28S) rRNA suggested that rRNA synthesis is the critical regulator of nucleolar size, and organization. Nucleolar reorganization upon stress emerges to be a direct function of nascent rRNA levels. Stress-induced transcription inhibition remodels the sub-nucleolar compartments from a viscoelastic state into solid-like condensates thereby perturbing the nucleolar pH gradient due to the missing rRNA scaffold. We show, that rather than signalling to mediate rDNA repair, nucleolar reorganization naturally arises primarily from reduced rRNA levels and the resultant biophysical restructuring of the nucleolus under cellular stress.",

    "title": "A moments-based approach for inferring mechanisms of transcriptional regulation using nascent RNA data",
    "summary": "Unraveling the kinetics of transcriptional regulation is a central challenge in molecular biology. Traditional inference methods based on cell-to-cell mRNA variability are limited because mRNA levels reflect not only transcriptional activity but also post-transcriptional processes. Recent advances in quantifying nascent RNAs across isogenic cells provide a more direct readout of transcriptional dynamics. Here, we present a moments-based theoretical framework that leverages nascent RNA data to infer transcriptional kinetics. We derive closed-form expressions for the first two time-dependent moments of nascent RNA across three canonical transcription models and demonstrate that nascent RNA exhibits distinct transient overshoots and higher Fano factors compared to mature mRNA. Through analysis of synthetic datasets, we show that these features enable more accurate estimation of transcriptional kinetics and allow reliable model selection, distinguishing single from multi-pathway promoter activation with over 75% accuracy even from small sample sizes. We further validated our model selection method using real experimental transcription datasets in yeast and E. coli cells, with nascent RNA demonstrating superior performance in identifying cross-talk pathway regulation. Our framework thus offers a computationally efficient and mechanistically informative approach for decoding transcriptional dynamics, emphasizing the advantages of time-dependent nascent RNA measurements over mature mRNA in capturing the true kinetics of transcriptional regulation.",

Leveraging the generalizability of large foundational models trained on protein and chemical data, we introduce PeptiVerse, a universal therapeutic peptide property prediction platform. PeptiVerse accepts either amino acid sequences or chemically modified peptide SMILES, delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse property prediction tasks, and provides both a web interface and open-source implementation for rapid, accessible, and scalable peptide developability analysis. By unifying property prediction across representations, PeptiVerse directly supports early-stage peptide therapeutic development campaigns and property-aware generative design workflows.

    "summary": "TMEM16A is a Ca2+-activated anion channel that provides direct electrical feedback to the plasma membrane in response to intracellular Ca2+. Its conductive state remains unresolved, leaving questions about gating, Cl- permeation, and modulation by Ca2+, depolarization, and lipids. To investigate the open state, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of TMEM16A bound to the putative open-state blocker 1PBC. After inhibitor removal, the putative, pore-lining helix TM4 developed kinks at two sites: an upper site that opens the pore for Cl- permeation, and a deeper site causing constriction. A conserved hydrophobic network between TM3 and TM4 persisted in most open structures but separated during extreme dilation, allowing lipids to transiently block the pore. Patch-clamp recordings indicated that the intact network promotes activation. Further simulations yielded > 60 Cl- permeation events and a single-channel conductance matching experiments. Additional electrostatic and kinetic modeling indicated that TMEM16As transition from outward-rectification to Ohmic conductance with increasing Ca2+ results from a weak voltage dependence of Ca2+ binding, which act cooperatively to open the pore.",

    "title": "Nanodisc-Mediated Visualization of Crowding-Induced Condensation and Membrane Reorganization in Two-Dimensional Membrane Environments",
    "summary": "Although biological membranes exhibit complex and dynamic organization, the mechanistic role of molecular crowding in governing lateral membrane heterogeneity remains poorly characterized experimentally. Here, we provide direct experimental visualization showing that crowding-induced condensation of membrane-anchored macromolecules above the bilayer interface reorganizes membrane dynamics and gives rise to spatially heterogeneous lipid mobility. Both PEGylated lipids and membrane-anchored proteins undergo surface-density-driven condensation on supported lipid bilayers, forming immobile regions that constrain lipid diffusion. Notably, the condensation threshold varies inversely with PEG chain length and surface density, defining a quantitative relationship between molecular size and crowding strength. To directly visualize these crowding-induced structures, we employed nanodelivery using lipid-loaded nanodiscs, revealing a clear correspondence between condensed crowder regions and diffusion barriers reminiscent of the picket-fence model of live-cell membranes. Similar condensation behavior observed for protein-crowded SLBs demonstrates the generality of this crowding-driven mechanism. Together, these findings establish surface-density-driven crowding and condensation of membrane-anchored macromolecules as a key physical mechanism underlying lateral membrane inhomogeneity and position nanodelivery as a general approach for interrogating membrane organization across synthetic and biological systems.",

    "title": "Superimposed Coding of Count Fingerprints to Binary Fingerprints",
    "summary": "Many cheminformatics workflows use Tanimoto similarity between binary fingerprints. When count fingerprints may be more appropriate, the benefit is often not large enough to justify replacing existing clustering tools, database search components, and other often highly optimized binary methods. This paper proposes a novel method based on random superimposed coding to convert count fingerprints to binary fingerprints such that the binary Tanimoto similarity between two binary fingerprints better approximates the multiset Tanimoto similarity between their original count form. In particular, the k-recall@k score for -nearest neighbor search is consistently better than hash-based folding or RDKit's count simulation conversion across the four count fingerprint generators in the RDKit, if the number of features is relatively small compared to the binary fingerprint size. For example, with 2048-bit Morgan fingerprints of radius 3, the recall at  for folded, count simulation, and superimposed coding are approximately 0.80, 0.86, and 0.94, respectively.",

    "title": "Reviving Algebraic Structure Approaches for Hidden Subgroup Variants and Novel Quantum Speedups in the NISQ Era",
    "summary": "The Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP) unifies several landmark quantum algorithms, yet systematic exploration of its variants and modern applications has slowed. This paper revives HSP-based algorithm design by examining new group structures with direct relevance to post-quantum cryptography, lattice problems, and structured optimization. We classify a family of finite and continuous groups-extensions and semi-direct products of abelian groups, matrix groups, and certain non-abelian groups-according to their Fourier-theoretic properties and the feasibility of efficient quantum Fourier transforms (QFTs). For each class, we determine whether the HSP admits an efficient quantum algorithm, a subexponential-time quantum algorithm, or appears intractable even quantumly. We construct explicit algorithms for eight new problem families, including structured lattice enumeration, automorphism groups of certain graphs, and algebraic attack primitives appearing in code-based and multivariate cryptosystems. For these, we show superpolynomial quantum speedups over all known classical approaches under standard complexity assumptions. We also discuss how approximate and block-encoded QFTs can be combined with variational post-processing to make some of these HSP algorithms more NISQ-friendly. Our results demonstrate that algebraic-structure-based quantum algorithms remain a rich and underexploited direction with both theoretical depth and potential cryptanalytic and optimization applications.",

    "title": "NAViFluX: a visualization-centric platform for interactive analysis, refinement and design of genome-scale metabolic networks",
    "summary": "Genome-scale metabolic network (GSMN) models are rigorously curated, cellular-level representations of metabolism that enable flux-based metabolite fate discovery, metabolic engineering, drug target identification and context-specific multi-omics integration. However, the inherent complexity of model architectures, need for programming skills and limited visualization support restrict their broader applicability. Existing tools focus on visualization and analyses separately, necessitating tool-specific format conversions, offer either topology or flux analyses options exclusively, lack intuitive pathway-specific visualizations, database-integrated model refinement, pathway enrichment and large-scale perturbation analyses. Here, we present NAViFluX (metabolic Network Analysis and Visualization of Flux), a visualization-centric, web browser-based environment that unifies GSMN exploration through native pathway/subsystem map generation using various layouts; interactive refinement through addition of reactions from KEGG/BiGG, amending constraints, pathway merging; and modules for flux computations, topology, functional enrichment. Instead of treating visualization as a post hoc step, NAViFluX performs all actions within network views, enabling users to make decisions directly from visually interpretable subnetworks. Using three Escherichia coli case studies, NAViFluX is shown to characterize nutrient-specific metabolic adaptations, improve metabolic gene essentiality predictions, provide mechanistic insight into synthetic lethality and facilitate the design of an optimized carbon-fixing metabolic state, thereby democratizing GSMNs for biologically meaningful applications.",
