    "title": "Hydration\u2013Complexation Balance in Eu(III)/Er(III) Extraction from Thiocyanate Media by Aliquat\u2011336",
    "summary": "We report on the speciation of two lanthanides, Eu(III) and Er(III), in aqueous and organic thiocyanate solutions obtained by solvent extraction with a quaternary ammonium extractant (Aliquat-336.thiocyanate, AQ.SCN) in toluene. The connection between the metal extraction behavior and the metal speciation in the two phases is investigated by a combination of spectroscopic techniques including UV-vis, photoluminescence, and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. Extraction studies show a higher extraction of Er(III) than Eu(III), with extractant dependency exponents of 2 and  1.5 respectively, indicating the formation of -1 to -2 charged anionic complexes in the organic phase. Spectroscopic studies indicate that the anionic complexes are not formed in the aqueous phase for either lanthanide, even at high NaSCN concentrations. Photoluminescence of Eu(III) in the organic phase shows the presence of multiple species with 3 and 5-6 thiocyanate anions in the inner coordination sphere corresponding to the non-integral exponents in extraction studies. ATR-FTIR spectra show differences in the CN stretching region of SCN- for the two lanthanides, corresponding to predominantly inner-sphere coordination of thiocyanate to Eu(III) and outer-sphere coordination to Er(III). Thus, while extraction studies show that the overall charge on the anionic species in the organic phase is greater for Er(III) than Eu(III), spectroscopic results reveal that the number of thiocyanate anions in the inner coordination sphere of Eu(III) is larger than that of Er(III). Thus, a balance of lanthanide hydration and complexation in the organic phase plays a major role in the extraction of lanthanides with AQ.SCN from thiocyanate solutions.",

    "title": "A direct LC\u2013MS/MS method for simultaneous quantitation of bisphenol S, propylparaben, monobutyl phthalate, and their metabolites in human urine",
    "summary": "Accurate biomonitoring of non-persistent endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) requires robust quantitative methods for reliable human exposure and risk assessment. Building on previous work showing that direct measurement of bisphenol A and its conjugated metabolites in human urine reveals substantial underestimation in commonly used indirect, hydrolysis-based approaches, this study addresses the broader need for direct assays of other short-lived EDCs. Here, a direct liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry method is developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of bisphenol S (BPS), propylparaben (PP), monobutyl phthalate (MBP), and their major glucuronide and sulfate conjugates in human urine, and its performance is systematically compared with that of indirect enzymatic hydrolysis\u2013based methods.\n\nChromatographic separation was achieved on a C18 column with gradient elution, and detection employed negative electrospray ionization in multiple reaction monitoring mode. The method exhibited excellent linearity (r\u00b2 > 0.995), low limits of detection (\u22640.1 ng/mL for all analytes except BPS glucuronide), and high precision (CV \u2264 7%) and accuracy (relative error \u2264 10%), fulfilling the U.S. FDA bioanalytical validation criteria. Solid-phase extraction provided quantitative and reproducible recoveries with minimal matrix effects and no detectable carryover. Comparison with indirect enzymatic hydrolysis demonstrated close agreement for BPS and PP but revealed concentration-dependent underestimation of MBP (down to ~65% recovery at higher concentrations) using the indirect method. Application of the validated method to urine samples from 30 second-trimester pregnant women showed that glucuronidated forms accounted for >90% of total analyte concentrations and that total BPS, PP and MBP levels exceeded contemporary National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) estimates. Our findings demonstrate that direct approaches can provide more accurate EDC biomonitoring data, highlighting the need to reevaluate exposure estimates derived from indirect methods in population studies.",

    "title": "Generalization and Usability of Co-Folded GPCR\u2013Ligand Complexes: A Physics-Guided Assessment",
    "summary": "Deep learning co-folding models for end-to-end protein\u2013ligand structure prediction mark a major advance beyond AlphaFold2, yet their reliability for decision-making in drug discovery remains unclear. Here, we benchmark Boltz, a state-of-the-art co-folding model, using a curated set of ligand-bound human G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) from families unseen during training. We find that the receptor backbones are generally predicted with reasonable accuracy, but ligand poses often deviate significantly from experimental structures. We then evaluate physics-based refinement with rigid-receptor (Glide) and induced-fit docking (IFD-MD) methods, which recover more than half of the misplaced ligands to near-experimental accuracy. As conventional evaluations for co-folded structures focus on distance-based metrics such as root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD), which can miss subtle but consequential binding-site errors, we carry out a further assessment of Boltz performance using free-energy perturbation (FEP+), which is both accurate and sensitive to starting-structure quality, on curated congeneric ligand series with known binding affinities that target the GPCRs. A significant fraction of the 14 congeneric series tested in this fashion fail to reproduce experimental binding affinities via FEP+ when employing the Boltz generated complex, even when the binding-site RMSD is low in some cases. IFD-MD rescues these failures and restores retrospective FEP signals to native-like level for all of these series. Together, these results delineate current generalization and usability limits of co-folded GPCR\u2013ligand complexes and motivate a workflow that pairs deep learning predictions with physics-based refinement and validation before high-stakes decisions in drug discovery.",

    "title": "Chimeric peptide-based radiopharmaceuticals for glioblastoma imaging and therapy by targeting mHsp70 and enhancing BBB penetration",
    "summary": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive form of malignant brain cancer. Here, we synthesized two chimeric peptide-based radiopharmaceuticals (Comb-1 and Comb-2) targeted to the membrane-bound form of heat shock protein 70 (mHsp70), which is overexpressed in GMB tissues, for future theranostic applications. The design concept features a DOTA chelator for coordination to different radiometals tethered directly or via the use of a PEG linker to a chimeric peptide. The latter combines the Hsp70-targeting ability of the TPP peptide sequence with the BBB penetration of another 7-amino acid sequence (D-PepH3) derived from the dengue virus capsid protein (DEN2C). The two compounds were successfully radiolabelled with Gallium-67, suitable for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging, or with Lutetium-177 for beta- therapy. Further, the in vitro properties of the ligand, including lipophilicity (LogD7.4), human serum albumin (HSA) binding, and stability in human serum were evaluated. The presence of the TPP sequence affected the half-life of the combinatorial peptides. Cytometry assays performed with a fluorescent analogue of Comb-2 confirmed the binding to mHsp70-expressing U87 MG cells. In an in vitro model, all tracers demonstrated the ability to cross the BBB, indicating that conjugation of the mHsp70-targeting peptide to the PepH3 sequence did not impair its translocating properties. Biodistribution experiments of 67Ga-labeled compounds were performed in naive female CD1 mice and showed brain uptake 2 min p.i., as well as renal excretion. For the best performing compound [67Ga]Ga Comb 2 (0.60\u00b10.17 %IA/g (injected activity per gram)), the biodistribution experiment was also performed with perfusion of the organs after the sacrifice, and the results showed retention of radioactivity in the brain (0.14\u00b10.05 %IA/g). Further metabolic studies in murine urine and blood were performed after biodistribution, confirming the stability of the chimeric tracers.",

We present a CPU-only, FCIDUMP-first workflow that (i) constructs a spectral double factorization (DF) of the ERI supermatrix G_(pq,rs) = (pq|rs), (ii) truncates the factorization at rank r and reports reconstruction residuals, (iii) evaluates DF resource proxies via \u03bb_LCU^DF and \u03bb_Burg^DF, and (iv) selects an operational rank by enforcing an observable-level constraint on a differential quantity: the MP2 correlation contribution to a model adsorption energy, \u0394E_ads,corr.

In this toy benchmark, \u03bb-metrics for the complex saturate at moderate ranks while the differential adsorption observable remains sensitive to intermediate-rank components, demonstrating that \u03bb convergence alone can be insufficient for rank selection when targeting chemically relevant differences. The resulting protocol provides a reproducible bridge between DF-based resource estimation and observable-constrained truncation criteria for qubitization-oriented Hamiltonians.",

We investigate this approach using photoactive Cu(I) complexes with the functional 4H-imidazolato ligand for storage of multiple photoredox equivalents. This study demonstrates that these complexes undergo light-driven reduction under a variety of reaction conditions involving different irradiation wavelengths, solvents, and elec-tron/proton donors. We used single-crystal X-ray analysis together with NMR spectroscopy to characterize the isolated photore-duction product. This analysis supports a proton-coupled two-electron transfer mechanism and reveals a significant structural trans-formation of the complex. By employing UV-Vis spectroscopy alongside DFT calculations, we elucidated the mechanisms underlying the photoreduction process, including protonation of both exocyclic nitrogen atoms at the chelating binding site as consequence of the two electron reduction, resulting in the migration of the Cu(I) bisphosphine fragment from the chelating binding site of the imidazolato ligand to form a trigonal-planar Cu(I) 1H-imidazolato complex. This rearrangement drastically changes the shape of the molecule, exposing an additional binding site on the Cu(I) center and making the N,N binding site available for subsequent reactions.",

    "title": "Memory effects in active droplets",
    "summary": "Marangoni-driven self-propelled droplets have attracted considerable attention as a platform to study active soft matter and collective behavior. The speed of active drops is generally assumed to be determined by instantaneous diameter and solubilization rate, which together dictate the spontaneously generated interfacial tension gradients across the drop surface and induce propulsion; the history of the droplet has not before been considered. Here, we report that active droplets can exhibit a type of memory wherein the temporal history of the droplet, particularly the starting diameter, influences the droplet speed. For example, two droplets of identical instantaneous diameter in the same local chemical environment can exhibit dramatically different instantaneous velocities depending upon their initial diameter. This effect is observed for a range of droplet oils and common ionic surfactants. The relationships between drop diameter, velocity, and solubilization rate were examined for several ionic and nonionic surfactants and suggest that droplet motility only is present when solubilization is interfacially limited, as opposed to diffusion limited. Oil droplets in ionic surfactant solutions also undergo a transition from motile to non-motile, where the diameter at the transitionary point depends upon initial drop diameter. We hypothesize that this memory behavior may result from an interfacial phase transition, as hinted at by observed visual deformations on drop interfaces under some circumstances. We believe this work provides insight as to how memory may be imparted in active droplet systems, highlights the importance of non-equilibrium phenomena in active materials, and offers valuable insights for the design of adaptive, dynamic droplet systems.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02621v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Stellar photospheric heterogeneities (e.g., starspots, faculae) distort the stellar spectrum in transit and imprint wavelength-dependent biases on the planet-to-star radius ratio (Transit Light Source Effect, TLSE). The Rackham-TLSE (R-TLSE) prescription applies a disc-averaged correction based solely on filling factor and spectral contrast, but transmission spectroscopy also depends on limb darkening, active-region distribution, and transit geometry. We include these in a pixel-resolved framework, ECLIPSE-Xlambda, and run idealised noise-free model-model comparisons to R-TLSE. For LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, and WASP-69 b, disc-averaged corrections differ from the pixel model by up to about 400 ppm in the optical for active hosts and non-equatorial transits, but stay below about 10 ppm in the near-infrared where limb darkening is weak. We then apply both approaches to the JWST/NIRISS SOSS spectrum of LHS 1140 b. With limb darkening set to zero, ECLIPSE-Xlambda recovers stellar-contamination parameters matching the reference R-TLSE solution, confirming consistency in the disc-averaged limit. With wavelength-dependent limb darkening, reproducing the short-wavelength slope via stellar contamination alone requires hot faculae (delta Tfac about 600 K; ffac about 0.35), equivalent to a circular facular region of radius about 0.6 Rstar (about 60% of the stellar radius) on the disc; such an extended unocculted region is physically unlikely even for an active M dwarf. Purely stellar contamination would therefore require extreme faculae, whereas a genuine atmospheric contribution complementing a more modest facular signal is more plausible. These results delineate the validity regime of R-TLSE and underscore the need for geometry-aware stellar-heterogeneity models including limb darkening in high-precision transmission spectroscopy.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02548v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The rise of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere during the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) occurred about 2.3 billion years ago. There is considerably greater uncertainty for the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis, but it likely occurred significantly earlier, perhaps by 700 million years. Assuming this time lag is proportional to the rate of oxygen generation, we can estimate how long it would take for a GOE-like event to occur on a hypothetical Earth-analog planet orbiting the star TRAPPIST-1 (a late M star with Teff 2560 K). Although in the habitable zone, an Earth-analog planet located in TRAPPIST-1e's orbit would receive only 0.9% of the Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) that the Earth gets from the Sun. This is because most of the star's light is emitted at wavelengths longer than the 400-700 nm PAR range. Thus it would take 63 Gyrs for a GOE to occur. But the linear assumption is problematic; as light levels increase, photosynthesis saturates then declines, an effect known as photoinhibition. Photoinhibition varies from species to species and depends on a host of environmental factors. There is also sensitivity to the upper wavelength limit of the PAR: extending just 50 nm increases the number of photons by a factor of 2.5. Including these and other factors greatly reduces the timescale to roughly 1-5 Gyrs for a GOE. However, non-oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria can thrive in low-light environments and can use near-IR light out to 1100 nm, providing 22 times as many photons. With this huge light advantage, and because they evolved earlier, anoxygenic photosynthesizers would likely dominate the ecosystem. On a late M-star Earth-analog planet, oxygen may never reach significant levels in the atmosphere and a GOE may never occur, let alone a Cambrian Explosion. Thus complex animal life is unlikely.",

    "title": "Tracing Pebble Drift History in Two Protoplanetary Disks with CO Enhancement",
    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02545v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Pebble drift is an important mechanism for supplying the materials needed to build planets in the inner region of protoplanetary disks. Thus, constraining pebble drift's timescales and mass flux is essential to understanding planet formation history. Current pebble drift models suggest pebble fluxes can be constrained from the enhancement of gaseous volatile abundances when icy pebbles sublimate after drifting across key snowlines. In this work, we present ALMA observations of spatially resolved $^{13}$C$^{18}$O J=2-1 line emission inside the midplane CO snowline of the HD 163296 and MWC 480 protoplanetary disks. We use radiative transfer and thermochemical models to constrain the spatial distribution of CO gas column density. We find that both disks display centrally peaked CO abundance enhancement of up to ten times of ISM abundance levels. For HD 163296 and MWC 480, the inferred enhancements require 250-350 and 480-660 Earth Masses of pebbles to have drifted across their CO snowlines, respectively. These ranges fall within cumulative pebble mass flux ranges to grow gas giants in the interior to the CO snowline. The centrally peaked CO enhancement is unexpected in current pebble drift models, which predict CO enhancement peaks at the CO snowline or is uniform inside the snowline. We propose two hypotheses to explain the centrally-peaked CO enhancement, including a large CO desorption distance and CO trapped in water ice. By testing both hypotheses with the 1D gas and dust evolution code chemcomp, we find that volatile trapping (about 30\\%) best reproduces the centrally peaked CO enhancement observed.",

An off-axis, freeform telescope delivers diffraction-limited image quality (Strehl $>$0.8 at 633 nm) to three instruments across a wide, flat focal plane. The three instruments provide complementary capabilities: a Wide-field Context Camera (WCC) delivers multi-band imaging over a 35' $\\times$ 12' footprint with high-cadence photometry; an Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) provides continuous 400-1700 nm spectroscopy at R $\\sim$ 100-500 for stable spectrophotometry; and an ExtraSolar Coronagraph (ESC) enables high-contrast imaging expected to reach raw contrasts of $10^{-8}$ and post-processed contrasts approaching $10^{-9}$. Operating from a 3:1 lunar-resonant orbit, Lazuli will respond to targets of opportunity in under four hours--a programmatic requirement designed to enable routine temporal responsiveness that is unprecedented for a space telescope of this size. Lazuli's technical capabilities are shaped around three broad science areas: (1) time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, (2) stars and planets, and (3) cosmology. These capabilities enable a potent mix of science spanning gravitational wave counterpart characterization, fast-evolving transients, Type Ia supernova cosmology, high-contrast exoplanet imaging, and spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres. While these areas guide the observatory design, Lazuli is conceived as a general-purpose facility capable of supporting a wide range of astrophysical investigations, with open time for the global community. We describe the observatory architecture and capabilities in the preliminary design phase, with science operations anticipated following a rapid development cycle from concept to launch.",

The planets have orbital periods of 2.567 days and 5.185 days, lying close to a 2:1 mean-motion resonance (MMR). Our photodynamical analysis of the TESS light curves constrains the planetary masses to $M_b = 7.7 \\pm 1.4\\,M_\\oplus$ and $M_c = 23.2 \\pm 4.7\\,M_\\oplus$. The measured masses and radii indicate the presence of volatile-rich gaseous envelopes on both planets.

Combined with the low mutual inclination constrained by the photodynamical analysis ($\\Delta I < 8.7\\,\\mathrm{deg}$), the planetary orbits are likely coplanar and aligned with the host star's spin axis. We show that the planets are near, but not in, the 2:1 MMR, with a circulating resonant angle. We also find substantial free eccentricity for the inner planet, TOI-4495 b ($e_b = 0.078^{+0.020}_{-0.013}$). Given the observed proximity to the 2:1 resonance and the more massive outer planet, TOI-4495 b and c are particularly susceptible to resonant overstability, which can convert resonantly excited eccentricity into free eccentricity. However, additional mechanisms (e.g., planetesimal scattering) may be required to further excite the eccentricity by $\\sim 4\\%$. To prevent tidal damping from reducing the eccentricity below the observed level over the star's lifetime (1.9 Gyr), the reduced tidal quality factor of TOI-4495 b must be $Q' \\gtrsim 10^5$, consistent with the presence of a thick envelope on the planet.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02479v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Planet formation is inherently linked to protoplanetary disc evolution, which recent developments suggest is driven by magnetised winds rather than turbulent viscosity. We study planet formation in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind-driven discs, assuming accretion occurs in a laminar surface layer above a weakly turbulent midplane. Our goal is to assess the global consequences of recent hydrodynamical results, including inefficient midplane heating and the existence of two Type II migration regimes: slow viscosity-dominated and fast wind-driven migration. We perform single-embryo planetary population syntheses with varying initial disc conditions (i.e. disc mass, size and angular momentum transport), and embryo starting locations, testing different prescriptions for the accretion layer thickness $\\Sigma_\\text{active}$. Thin ($\\lesssim0.01\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-2}}$) or fast ($\\gtrsim12\\%$ sonic velocity) accretion layers result in slow, viscosity-dominated regime which strongly limits the extent of Type II migration. For thick ($\\gtrsim1\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-2}}$) or slow ($\\lesssim3\\%$ sonic velocity) accretion layers, fast wind-driven Type II migration occurs frequently, leading to long-range inward migration that sets in once planets reach masses sufficient to block the accreting layer. Disk-limited gas accretion is also strongly affected by deep and early gap opening, limiting maximum giant planet masses. These effects strongly influence the final mass-distance distribution. For thin layers, giant planets form nearly in situ once they have entered Type II migration, which happens already at a few Earth masses, while thick layers lead to numerous migrated Hot Jupiters. Overall, we find that while the global properties of the emerging planet population are strongly modified relative to classical viscous discs, key properties of the observed population can be reproduced within this new paradigm.",

We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the rare isotopologue 13C18O(2-1) at approximately 0.3 arcsec resolution from the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296, combined with archival observations of C17O(2-1), C18O(1-0), and C17O(1-0), to empirically constrain carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios without detailed disk modeling. Both the C17O/13C18O(2-1) and C18O/C17O(1-0) flux ratios rise sharply across the CO snowline and flatten beyond 1.5 arcsec (r >= 150 au), where the emission becomes optically thin. This transition, reflecting a steep drop in CO column density set by the disk's thermal structure, makes HD 163296 an optimal case for isotopic analysis. Using beam-averaged intensities of the four transitions measured in this optically thin region, we derive isotopic ratios of 12C/13C = 75.3 (+14.7/-11.4) and 18O/17O = 3.28 (+0.31/-0.26), both consistent with local interstellar medium values. The 16O/18O ratio remains weakly constrained due to moderate optical depth in the C18O(1-0) line and degeneracy with CO column density. These results demonstrate that rare CO isotopologues can provide robust, empirical constraints on isotopic ratios in disks when sharp structural transitions allow for the identification of optically thin regions, and establish HD 163296 as a benchmark for extending such studies to other systems with resolved snowline structures.",

Since water ice is the most common frozen volatile, it plays an essential role in the formation of planets and minor bodies. Although water ice has been commonly found in Kuiper belt objects and comets in the Solar System, no definitive evidence for water ice in debris disks has been obtained to date. Here, we report the discovery of water ice in the HD 181327 disk using the James Webb Space Telescope Near-Infrared Spectrograph. We detect the solid-state broad absorption feature of water ice at 3 $\\mu$m and a distinct Fresnel peak feature at 3.1 $\\mu$m, a characteristic of large water-ice particles. This implies the presence of a water-ice reservoir in the HD 181327 exoKuiper belt. Gradients of water-ice features at different stellocentric distances reveal a dynamic process of destroying and replenishing water ice in the disk, with estimated water-ice mass fractions ranging from 0.1% at ~85 au to 14% at ~113 au. It is highly plausible that the icy bodies that release water ice in HD 181327 could be the extra-solar counterparts of some of the Kuiper belt objects in our Solar System, supported by their spectral similarity.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02486v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This manuscript investigates the impact of key dust evolution parameters on dust retention and trapping in protoplanetary discs. Using models with and without pressure bumps, combined with radiative transfer simulations, images of the dust continuum emission at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths, their fluxes and observed disc sizes are presented. For discs without pressure bumps (smooth discs), significant dust mass can only be retained over Myr timescales when dust fragmentation velocities are low (1m/s) and with viscosity values of $\\alpha=10^{-3}$. For such a combination of fragmentation velocity and viscosity, the synthetic images show a bright inner emission follow by a shallow emission with potential gaps if they are present in the gas profile as well. At higher fragmentation velocities (5-10m/s), most dust is lost due to radial drift at million-year timescales unless pressure traps are present, in which case dust masses can increase by orders of magnitude and structures are observed in synthetic images. The viscosity parameter strongly shapes observable features, with low $\\alpha$ producing sharper, potentially asymmetric inner wall cavities in inclined discs due to optically thick emission. High $\\alpha$ favors the appearance of shoulders around the predominant rings that dust trapping produces. However, distinguishing between different fragmentation velocities observationally remains challenging.

Here, we show that atmospheres that appear volatile-rich and/or cloudy may instead be helium-rich. As transmission spectra constrain the atmospheric scale height ($H$), a He-enriched atmosphere can be misinterpreted as H$_2$-dominated water-rich to bring the mean molecular weight ($\\mu$) to intermediate values ($\\sim$4$-$10) when He/H$_2$ is fixed. Similarly, a cloud deck can reduce the spectral features, and thus the apparent (i.e., cloud-free equivalent) $H$. We present a proof-of-concept reanalysis of HD~209458~b's JWST transmission spectrum treating He/H$_2$ as a free parameter, resulting in sets of He-rich solutions. We argue that He enhancement must be considered to reliably constrain atmospheric composition, be sensitive to a more diverse planetary population, and ultimately yield robust trends to inform formation and evolution pathways. Looking ahead, we suggest leveraging insights from differences in pressure-broadening effects, outflow measurements, and atmospheric chemistry to disentangle reliably between He-, volatile-rich, and cloudy atmospheres -- while recognizing that associated models need targeted upgrades to reach the fidelity level required to this end.",

Beyond conventional effects (e.g. adsorption/reaction, interfacial transport, phase transition shifts), recent experimental and theoretical studies on metallic surfaces have unraveled exotic peculiarities such as complex electrostatic screening, unexpected wetting transition, and interfacial quantum friction. These novel features require developing and embarking new tools to tackle the coupling between charge relaxation in the metal and molecular behavior in the vicinal fluid. Here, using the concept of Virtual Thomas-Fermi fluids, we employ a molecular simulation approach to investigate interfacial transport of fluid molecules and metal charge carriers at their interface--including the underlying electrostatically-driven dynamic friction and the coupling between charge current/hydrodynamic flow (the so-called electrohydrodynamic drag). While conventional numerical techniques consider either insulating materials or metallic materials described as polarizable, non-conducting media, our atom-scale strategy provides an effective yet realistic description of the solid excitation spectrum--including charge relaxation modes and conductivity. By applying this approach to water near metallic surfaces of various electrostatic screening lengths, we unveil a non-monotonous dependence of the fluid/solid friction on the metallicity with a maximum occurring as the charge dynamic structure factors of the solid and fluid strongly overlap. Moreover, we report a direct observation of the electrohydrodynamic drag which arises from the momentum transfer between the solid and liquid through dynamic electrostatic interactions and the underlying interfacial friction.",

The transport of thermal energy in liquids and even within proteins is well understood but kinetic energy transfer across a heterogeneous molecular boundary provides additional challenges. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations under steady-state conditions to analyze how a protein dissipates surplus thermal energy into the surrounding solvent. We specifically focus on collective degrees of freedom that govern the dynamics of the system from the diffusive regime to mid-infrared frequencies. Using a fully anharmonic analysis of molecular vibrations, we analyzed their vibrational spectra, temperatures, and heat transport efficiencies. We find that the most efficient energy transfer mechanisms are associated with solvent-mediated friction. However, this mechanism only applies to a small number of degrees of freedom of a protein. Instead, less efficient vibrational energy transfer in the far-infrared dominates heat transfer overall due to a large number of vibrations in this frequency range. A notable by-product of this work is a highly sensitive measure of deviations from energy equi-partition in equilibrium systems, which can be used to analyze non-ergodic properties.",

Recent studies have highlighted that individual quantum trajectories also encode essential physical information. Prominent examples include measurement induced phase transitions, where a pure quantum state corresponding to fixed measurement outcomes (trajectories) exhibits distinct entanglement phases, depending on the measurement rate. However, direct observation of this effect is hindered by an exponential post-selection barrier, whereby the probability of realizing a specific trajectory is exponentially small. We propose a deterministic method to efficiently prepare quantum trajectories in polynomial time using imaginary time evolution and, thus, overcome this fundamental challenge. We demonstrate that our method applies to a certain class of quantum states, and argue that there does not exist universal approaches for any quantum trajectories. Our result paves the way for experimentally exploring the physics of individual quantum trajectories at scale and enables direct observation of certain post-selection-dependent phenomena.",

On the classical side, we consider bi-Hamiltonian systems defined by a Poisson pencil with non-trivial invariants. Using an exact symplectic realization, these invariants are lifted and projected onto a contact manifold, yielding a completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system in terms of dissipated quantities and a Jacobi-commutative algebra of observables. On the quantum side, we introduce a class of contact-compatible Lindblad generators: GKSL evolutions whose dissipative part preserves a commutative $C^\\ast$-subalgebra generated by the quantizations of the classical dissipated quantities, and whose Hamiltonian part admits an Egorov-type semiclassical limit to the contact dynamics. This construction provides a mathematical mechanism compatible with the semiclassical limit for pure dephasing, compatible with integrability and contact dissipation.

Its exponent appears in many areas of Mathematics and Physics. Quantum polylogarithms satisfy a holonomic systems of modular difference equations with coefficients in variations of mixed Hodge-Tate structures of motivic origin. If h is a rational number, the quantum polylogarithms can be expressed via multiple polylogarithms. Otherwise quantum polylogarithms are not periods of variations of mixed motives, i.e. they can not be given by integrals of rational differential forms on algebraic varieties. Instead, quantum polylogarithms are integrals of differential forms built from both rational functions and exponentials of rational functions. We call them rational exponential integrals.

These tensors satisfy the first Bianchi identity and obey a hereditary contraction relation interpolating between the double dual tensor and the Einstein tensor.\n  We prove that, in a generic geometric setting, each tensor in this hierarchy is the unique divergence--free $(p,p)$ double form depending linearly on the Riemann curvature tensor, thereby providing canonical higher--rank parents of the Einstein tensor.\n  Their sectional curvatures coincide with the $p$--curvatures; notably, the $2$--curvature determines the full Riemann curvature tensor and forces the $\\hat A$--genus of a compact spin manifold to vanish when nonnegative, a property not shared by Ricci or scalar curvature.

We verify their conjecture in the case of the two-point spectral density for a quantum particle in a three-dimensional box, subject to a Diophantine condition on the domain's proportions. A permissible choice of width, height and depth is for example $1,2^{1/3},2^{-1/3}$. This extends previous work of Eskin, Margulis and Mozes (Annals of Math., 2005) in dimension two, where the problem reduces to the quantitative Oppenheim conjecture for quadratic forms of signature $(2,2)$. The difficulty in three and higher dimensions is that we need to consider the distribution of indefinite forms in shrinking rather than fixed intervals, which we are able to resolve for special diagonal forms of signature $(3,3)$ in various scalings, including a rate of convergence. A key step of our approach is to represent the relevant counting problem as an average of a theta function on $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{Z})^3\\backslash\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})^3$ over an expanding family of one-parameter unipotent orbits.

This model is also bijectively equivalent to the Fortuin--Kasteleyn model of planar maps with parameter $q\\in (0,4)$ at its self-dual point. These have been traditionally studied using either techniques from analytic combinatorics (based in particular on the gasket decomposition of Borot, Bouttier and Guitter arXiv:1106.0153) or probabilistic arguments (based on Sheffield's hamburger-cheeseburger bijection arXiv:1108.2241). In this paper we establish a dictionary relating quantities of interest in both approaches. This has several consequences. First, we derive an exact expression for the partition function of the fully packed loop-$O(n)$ model on triangulations, as a function of the outer boundary length. This confirms predictions by Gaudin and Kostov. In particular, this model exhibits critical behaviour, in the sense that the partition function exhibits a power-law decay characteristic of the critical regime at this self-dual point. Finally, we derive precise asymptotics for geometric features of the FK model of planar maps when $0 < q <4$, such as the exact tail behaviour of the perimeters of clusters and loops. This sharpens previous results of arXiv:1502.00450 and arXiv:1502.00546.

Previous research into missions using chemical propulsion have only really addressed the direct case, where the opportunity to launch already expired before 3I/ATLAS's discovery. In contrast, investigations herein exploit 'Optimum Interplanetary Trajectory Software' to simulate an alternative indirect option for chemical propulsion, namely the Solar Oberth Manoeuvre (SOM). For a SOM, a low perihelion burn provides maximum benefit from the Oberth Effect, and accelerates the spacecraft rapidly towards the receding 3I/ATLAS. Though in principle feasible, results indicate this option presents significant challenges. For possible launch years between 2031 and 2037 inclusive, a 2035 launch permits the most efficient transfer to 3I/ATLAS. The reference mission requires a SOM at 3.2 Solar Radii from the Sun's centre, with an intercept after 35-50 years. It is found the SOM can leverage spacecraft masses up to $\\sim{500}$ kg. Two or three solid propellant boosters could deliver the required SOM $\\Delta$V, and furthermore a refuelled Starship Block 3 in LEO has sufficient performance for such a mission.

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02599v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent observations of small bodies of the Solar System showed evidence of the presence of refractory (asteroidal) material in the Oort cloud. Different models of the origin of the Solar System predict different numbers of rocky objects in the Oort cloud, meaning that measurement of this population can be used as an observational constraint for cosmogonic models. The aim of our work is to study how the data obtained from meteor observations can be used as a tool for distinguishing among the existing cosmogonic models. We investigated two meteor databases collected by the cameras of the All-Sky Meteor Orbit System (AMOS) located in the Canary Islands and in Chile. We describe methodology and results of the search for unusually strong rocky meteoroids on cometary orbits with the origin in the Oort cloud. These data will be used to calculate the fluxes of meteors of different compositions in order to constrain the ratio of icy and rocky components of the Oort cloud. For the flux determination, we estimate the observational time and effective area of the AMOS system.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02637v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Though missions devoted to time series photometry focus primarily on targets far beyond the solar system, their observations can be contaminated by foreground minor planets, especially near the ecliptic plane where solar system objects are most prevalent. Crucially, depending on one's choice of data reduction/background estimation algorithm, these objects can induce both apparent brightening and/or dimming events in processed light curves. To quantify the impact of these objects on archived TESS light curves, we used N-body integrations of all currently known minor planets to postdict all 600,000+ of their interactions with stars selected for high-cadence observations during TESS ecliptic plane sectors. We then created mock images of these moving sources and performed simple aperture photometry using the same target and background apertures used in SPOC processing. Our resulting 10,000+ target-specific light curves, which faithfully model the time-dependent positions and magnitudes of the actual solar system objects that approached each target, reveal that $>95\\%$ of high-cadence ecliptic plane targets experience a minor planet crossing within 1 TESS pixel of the source. Additionally, 50% of all $T>13$ mag targets experience at least one instantaneous moment where the contaminating flux from minor planets exceeds 1% of the target flux. We discuss these population-level results and others, and highlight several case studies of bright flybys.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02995v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present new Rosseland and Planck mean opacity tables relevant to the shallow interiors and atmospheres of giant planets. The tables span metallicities from 0.31 to 50 times solar, temperatures from 100 - 6000 K, and pressures from 1e-6 - 1e5 bar, thereby covering a wider parameter space than previous data sets. Our calculations employ the latest molecular and atomic line lists and pressure-broadening treatments, and include contributions from collision-induced absorption, free electrons, and scattering processes. We further provide cloudy mean opacity tables that account for cloud particle extinction across a range of particle sizes and capture the sequential removal of condensates as the gas cools. We benchmark our cloud-free tables against widely used opacity tables and find significant relative differences, exceeding 100% in Rosseland mean opacities at T \\gtrsim 3000 K due to the inclusion of additional short-wavelength absorbers. Differences in Planck mean opacities at high temperatures are even larger, in some cases exceeding two orders of magnitude, which is most likely driven by the inclusion of Ca, Mg, and Fe cross-sections and updated Na D and K I resonance line treatments. Cloud opacities substantially increase Rosseland mean opacities for T \\lesssim 2800 K, while their effect on Planck mean opacities is weaker. We also discuss limitations of our mean opacities at high pressures, where non-ideal effects become important. This work provides improved cloud-free mean opacity tables for giant planets, as well as the first publicly available cloudy mean opacity tables, which will enable more realistic modeling of their atmospheres and interiors.",

Here, we statistically analyze magnetic field power spectra across 370 magnetotail CSs observed by MESSENGER. About 20% of the events are quasi-laminar, showing single power-law spectra, whereas 80% are turbulent, exhibiting a spectral break separating inertial and kinetic ranges. A dawn-dusk asymmetry is identified: inertial-range slopes are systematically shallower on the dawnside, whereas kinetic-range slopes are steeper, indicating more developed turbulence there, consistent with the higher occurrence of reconnection-related processes on the dawnside. Component analysis shows that the transverse components, orthogonal to the tail-aligned principal field (BX), display shallow slopes near -1 in the inertial range, suggesting energy injection at ion scales rather than a classical inertial range. These results demonstrate that Mercury's unique plasma environment fundamentally reshapes the initiation of turbulence and the redistribution of energy in the magnetotail.",

For kernels whose timescales are significantly longer than the typical exposure times, such GP kernels are sufficient. For time series where the exposure time is comparable to the kernel timescale, the observed signal represents an exposure-averaged version of the true underlying signal. This distinction is important in the context of recent data streams from Extreme Precision Radial Velocity (EPRV) spectrographs like fast readout stellar data of asteroseismology targets and solar data to monitor the Sun's variability during daytime observations. Current solar EPRV facilities have significantly different exposure times per-site, owing to the different design choices made. Consequently, each instrument traces different binned versions of the same \"latent\" signal. Here we present a GP framework that accounts for exposure times by computing integrated forms of the instantaneous kernels typically used. These functions allow one to predict the true latent oscillation signals and the exposure-binned version expected by each instrument. We extend the framework to work for instruments with significant time overlap (i.e., similar longitude) by including relative instrumental drift components that can be predicted and separated from the stellar variability components. We use Sun-as-a-star EPRV datasets as our primary example, but present these approaches in a generalized way for application to any dataset where exposure times are a relevant factor or combining instruments with significant overlap.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02527v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Astronomical measurements are often integrated over finite exposures, which can obscure latent variability on comparable timescales. Correctly accounting for exposure integration with Gaussian Processes (GPs) in such scenarios is essential but computationally challenging: once exposure times vary or overlap across measurements, the covariance matrix forfeits any quasiseparability, forcing O($N^2$) memory and O($N^3$) runtime costs. Linear Gaussian state space models (SSMs) are equivalent to GPs and have well-known O($N$) solutions via the Kalman filter and RTS smoother. In this work, we extend the GP-SSM equivalence to handle integrated measurements while maintaining scalability by augmenting the SSM with an integral state that resets at exposure start times and is observed at exposure end times. This construction yields exactly the same posterior as a fully integrated GP but in O($N$) time on a CPU, and is parallelizable down to O($N/T + \\log T$) on a GPU with $T$ parallel workers. We present smolgp (State space Model for O(Linear/log) GPs), an open-source Python/JAX package offering drop-in compatibiltiy with tinygp while supporting both standard and exposure-aware GP modeling. As SSMs provide a framework for representing general GP kernels via their series expansion, smolgp also brings scalable performance to many commonly used covariance kernels in astronomy that lack quasiseparability, such as the quasiperiodic kernel. The substantial performance boosts at large $N$ will enable massive multi-instrument cross-comparisons where exposure overlap is ubiquitous, and unlocks the potential for analyses with more complex models and/or higher dimensional datasets.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2511.14733v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Protoplanetary disks observed in millimeter continuum and scattered light show a variety of substructures. Various physical processes in the disk could trigger such features -- one of which that has been previously theorized for passive disks is the thermal wave instability -- the flared disk may become unstable as directly illuminated regions puff up and cast shadows behind them. This would manifest as bright and dark rings, and a staircase-like structure in the disk optical surface. We provide a realistic radiation hydrodynamic model to test the limits of the thermal wave instability in irradiated disks. We carry out global axisymmetric 2D hydrostatic and dynamic simulations including radiation transport with frequency-dependent ray-traced irradiation and flux-limited diffusion (FLD). We found that starlight-driven shadows are most prominent in optically thick, slow cooling disks, shown by our models with high surface densities and dust-to-gas ratios of sub-micron grains of 0.01. We recover that thermal waves form and propagate inwards in the hydrostatic limit. In contrast, our hydrodynamic models show bumps and shadows within 30 au that converge to a quasi-steady state on several radiative diffusion timescales -- indicating a long-lived staircase structure. We find that existing thermal pressure bumps could produce and enhance this effect, forming secondary shadowing downstream. Hydrostatic models with self-consistent dust settling instead show a superheated dust irradiation absorption surface with a radially smooth temperature profile without staircases. We conclude that one can recover thermally induced flared-staircase structures in radiation hydrodynamic simulations of irradiated protoplanetary disks using flux-limited diffusion. We highlight the importance of modeling dust dynamics consistently to explain starlight-driven shadows.",

Using 3D simulations of rotating convection in spherical shells, we show that inertial modes--oscillations restored by the Coriolis force--emerge naturally in rotationally constrained turbulence, without imposing any external forcing other than thermal/buoyancy driving. By varying the rotation rate at fixed Rayleigh number, we find that coherent modes appear only when the convective Rossby number, the ratio of the rotation period to the convective turnover time, falls below about one-half, where rotation dominates the dynamics. These modes are mostly retrograde in the rotating frame, equatorially symmetric, and confined to mid and high latitudes, with discrete frequencies well below twice the background rotation rate. At lower viscosities, or smaller Prandtl number, mode excitation becomes more efficient and a broader spectrum of inertial modes emerges. While the precise excitation mechanism remains uncertain, our results suggest that the modes are driven by instabilities due to differential rotation rather than stochastic forcing by convection. We conclude that similar inertial modes are likely to exist in the interiors of giant planets and stars, though their low frequencies will make them difficult to detect.",

A plausible driver is upstream turbulence. Broadband fluctuations arriving at the front can continually wrinkle it, changing the local shock geometry and, in turn, conditions for particle injection and radiation. We develop a linear-MHD formulation that treats the shock as a moving interface rather than a fixed boundary. In this approach the shock response can be summarized by an effective impedance determined by the Rankine-Hugoniot base state and the shock geometry, while the upstream turbulence enters only through its statistics. This provides a practical mapping from an assumed incident spectrum to the corrugation amplitude, its drift along the surface, and a coherence scale set by weak damping or leakage. The response is largest when the transmitted downstream fast mode propagates nearly parallel to the shock in the shock frame, which produces a Lorentzian-type enhancement controlled by the downstream normal group speed. We examine how compression, plasma $\\beta$, and obliquity affect these corrugation properties and discuss implications for fine structure in heliospheric and supernova-remnant shock emission.",

Classical methods for computing Nash equilibria, especially in linear quadratic settings, rely on strong structural assumptions and become impractical for nonlinear dynamics, many players, or long horizons, where multiple local equilibria may exist. We show through examples that such methods can fail to reach the true global Nash equilibrium even in relatively small games. To address this, we propose two population based evolutionary algorithms for general dynamic games with linear or nonlinear dynamics and arbitrary objective functions: a co evolutionary genetic algorithm and a hybrid genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization scheme. Both approaches search directly over joint strategy spaces without restrictive assumptions and are less prone to getting trapped in local Nash equilibria, providing more reliable approximations to global Nash solutions.",

Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) can effectively handle these diverse nodes and edges, capturing heterogeneous information within the graph, thus exhibiting outstanding performance. However, most methods of HGNNs usually involve complex structural designs, leading to problems such as high memory usage, long inference time, and extensive consumption of computing resources. These limitations pose certain challenges for the practical application of HGNNs, especially for resource-constrained devices. To mitigate this issue, we propose the Spiking Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks (SpikingHAN), which incorporates the brain-inspired and energy-saving properties of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) into heterogeneous graph learning to reduce the computing cost without compromising the performance. Specifically, SpikingHAN aggregates metapath-based neighbor information using a single-layer graph convolution with shared parameters. It then employs a semantic-level attention mechanism to capture the importance of different meta-paths and performs semantic aggregation. Finally, it encodes the heterogeneous information into a spike sequence through SNNs, simulating bioinformatic processing to derive a binarized 1-bit representation of the heterogeneous graph. Comprehensive experimental results from three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets show that SpikingHAN delivers competitive node classification performance. It achieves this with fewer parameters, quicker inference, reduced memory usage, and lower energy consumption. Code is available at https://github.com/QianPeng369/SpikingHAN.",

These applications frequently require near real-time responses and low energy consumption on edge devices. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer event-driven computation and ultra-low power by exploiting temporal sparsity and multiplication-free computation. Yet existing SNN-based time-series forecasters often inherit complex transformer blocks, thereby losing much of the efficiency benefit. To solve the problem, we propose SpikySpace, a spiking state-space model (SSM) that reduces the quadratic cost in the attention block to linear time via selective scanning. Further, we replace dense SSM updates with sparse spike trains and execute selective scans only on spike events, thereby avoiding dense multiplications while preserving the SSM's structured memory. Because complex operations such as exponentials and divisions are costly on neuromorphic chips, we introduce simplified approximations of SiLU and Softplus to enable a neuromorphic-friendly model architecture. In matched settings, SpikySpace reduces estimated energy consumption by 98.73% and 96.24% compared to two state-of-the-art transformer based approaches, namely iTransformer and iSpikformer, respectively. In standard time series forecasting datasets, SpikySpace delivers competitive accuracy while substantially reducing energy cost and memory traffic. As the first full spiking state-space model, SpikySpace bridges neuromorphic efficiency with modern sequence modeling, marking a practical and scalable path toward efficient time series forecasting systems.",

To reconcile this, we trained biologically constrained deep networks, based on scale-invariant hippocampal time cells, on a language classification task mimicking the hierarchical structure of language (e.g., 'letters' forming 'words'). First, using a feedforward model (SITHCon), we found that a hierarchy of TRWs emerged naturally across layers, despite the network having an identical spectrum of time constants within layers. We then distilled these inductive priors into a biologically plausible recurrent architecture, SITH-RNN. Training a sequence of architectures ranging from generic RNNs to this restricted subset showed that the scale-invariant SITH-RNN learned faster with orders-of-magnitude fewer parameters, and generalized zero-shot to out-of-distribution timescales.

Building on this foundation, we present MyoText, a hierarchical framework that decodes sEMG signals to text through physiologically grounded intermediate stages. MyoText first classifies finger activations from multichannel sEMG using a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model, applies ergonomic typing priors to infer letters, and reconstructs full sentences with a fine-tuned T5 transformer. This modular design mirrors the natural hierarchy of typing, linking muscle intent to language output and reducing the search space for decoding. Evaluated on 30 users from the emg2qwerty dataset, MyoText outperforms baselines by achieving 85.4% finger-classification accuracy, 5.4% character error rate (CER), and 6.5% word error rate (WER). Beyond accuracy gains, this methodology establishes a principled pathway from neuromuscular signals to text, providing a blueprint for virtual and augmented-reality typing interfaces that operate entirely without physical keyboards.

Here, we study two compositionally similar alloy glasses near their glass transition temperatures: the phase change material (PCM) Ge15Sb85 and the non-PCM alloy Ge15Te85. Both exhibit X-ray induced atomic motion, yet with markedly different responses. Ge15Sb85 undergoes an immediate transition to a photo-induced yielding state, characterised by stationary dynamics governed solely by the absorbed dose. In contrast, Ge15Te85 shows a progressive slowing-down of the relaxation process, accompanied by a crossover from compressed to stretched exponential decay in the density autocorrelation functions. This behaviour is consistent with the emergence of liquid-like collective motion as supported by de Gennes narrowing in the wave-vector dependence of the dynamics at length scales comparable with the first sharp diffraction peak. Unlike Ge15Sb85, this alloy does not reach a stationary regime within experimental timescales, implying that the yielding transition occurs only after thousands of seconds with the available dose rate. Its response is also temperature dependent: at lower temperatures, the dynamics reflects intrinsic stress relaxation processes, whereas at higher temperatures becomes dose-controlled. These findings demonstrate that the dynamical response to X-ray excitation is not determined solely by chemical composition or bonding character, but results from the interplay between irradiation effects and structural relaxation pathways.",

    "title": "Integrating upstream and downstream reciprocity stabilizes cooperator-defector coexistence in others-only public goods games",
    "summary": "arXiv:2509.04743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Human cooperation persists among strangers in large, well-mixed populations despite theoretical predictions of difficulties, leaving a fundamental evolutionary puzzle. While upstream (pay-it-forward: helping others because you were helped) and downstream (rewarding-reputation: helping those with good reputations) indirect reciprocity have been independently considered as solutions, their joint dynamics in multiplayer contexts remain unexplored. We study public goods games without self-return (often called \"others-only\" PGGs) with benefit b and cost c and analyze evolutionary dynamics for three strategies: unconditional cooperation (ALLC), unconditional defection (ALLD), and an integrated reciprocity strategy combining unconditional forwarding with reputation-based discrimination. We show that integrating upstream and downstream reciprocity can yield a globally asymptotically stable mixed equilibrium of ALLD and integrated reciprocators when b/c > 2 in the absence of complexity costs. We analytically derive a critical threshold for complexity costs. If cognitive demands exceed this threshold, the stable equilibrium disappears via a saddle-node bifurcation. Otherwise, within the stable regime, complexity costs counterintuitively stabilize the equilibrium by preventing not only ALLC but also alternative conditional strategies from invading. Rather than requiring uniformity, our model reveals one pathway to stable cooperation through strategic diversity. ALLD serves as \"evolutionary shields\" preventing system collapse while integrated reciprocators flexibly combine open and discriminative responses. This framework demonstrates how pay-it-forward broadcasting and reputation systems can jointly maintain social polymorphism including cooperation despite cognitive limitations and group size challenges, offering a potential evolutionary foundation for behavioral diversity in human societies.",

Hydraulically amplified electrostatic (HASEL) actuators, a class of soft artificial muscles, offer high performance but exhibit memory effects and hysteresis. Here we present a data-driven reduction and control strategy grounded in spectral submanifold (SSM) theory. In the adiabatic regime, where inputs vary slowly relative to intrinsic transients, trajectories rapidly converge to a low-dimensional slow manifold. We learn an explicit input-to-output map on this manifold from forced-response trajectories alone, avoiding decay experiments that can trigger hysteresis. We deploy the SSM-based model for real-time control of an antagonistic HASEL-clutch joint. This approach yields a substantial reduction in tracking error compared to feedback-only and feedforward-only baselines under identical settings.

Applied to systems with multichromatic and Morse interaction potentials, the reduced model reproduces key features of the clustering process, including transitions between cluster configurations and the emergence of metastable states.

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.03075v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Trajectory prediction (TP) is crucial for ensuring safety and efficiency in modern air traffic management systems. It is, for example, a core component of conflict detection and resolution tools, arrival sequencing algorithms, capacity planning, as well as several future concepts. However, TP accuracy within operational systems is hampered by a range of epistemic uncertainties such as the mass and performance settings of aircraft and the effect of meteorological conditions on aircraft performance. It can also require considerable computational resources.\n  This paper proposes a method for adaptive TP that has two components: first, a fast surrogate TP model based on linear state space models (LSSM)s with an execution time that was 6.7 times lower on average than an implementation of the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) in Python. It is demonstrated that such models can effectively emulate the BADA aircraft performance model, which is based on the numerical solution of a partial differential equation (PDE), and that the LSSMs can be fitted to trajectories in a dataset of historic flight data. Secondly, the paper proposes an algorithm to assimilate radar observations using particle filtering to adaptively refine TP accuracy. Comparison with baselines using BADA and Kalman filtering demonstrate that the proposed framework improves system identification and state estimation for both climb and descent phases, with 46.3% and 64.7% better estimates for time to top of climb and bottom of descent compared to the best performing benchmark model. In particular, the particle filtering approach provides the flexibility to capture non-linear performance effects including the CAS-Mach transition.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.03209v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Berry and Tabor conjectured in 1977 that spectra of generic integrable quantum systems have the same local statistics as a Poisson point process. We verify their conjecture in the case of the two-point spectral density for a quantum particle in a three-dimensional box, subject to a Diophantine condition on the domain's proportions. A permissible choice of width, height and depth is for example $1,2^{1/3},2^{-1/3}$. This extends previous work of Eskin, Margulis and Mozes (Annals of Math., 2005) in dimension two, where the problem reduces to the quantitative Oppenheim conjecture for quadratic forms of signature $(2,2)$. The difficulty in three and higher dimensions is that we need to consider the distribution of indefinite forms in shrinking rather than fixed intervals, which we are able to resolve for special diagonal forms of signature $(3,3)$ in various scalings, including a rate of convergence. A key step of our approach is to represent the relevant counting problem as an average of a theta function on $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{Z})^3\\backslash\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})^3$ over an expanding family of one-parameter unipotent orbits. The asymptotic behaviour of these unipotent averages follows from Ratner's measure classification theorem and subtle escape of mass estimates.",

Each individual modulates the amplitude of its random motion according to the perceived local density of neighbors. Memory is introduced via a chain of $K$~internal variables that allow agents to retain information about previously encountered densities. The parameter $K$ controls the effective length of memory. A formal mean-field limit yields a macroscopic Fokker--Planck equation, which provides a continuum description of the system in the large-population limit. Steady states of this equation are characterized to interpret the emergence and morphology of clusters. Systematic stochastic simulations in one- and two-dimensional spatial domains reveal that short- or moderate-term memory promotes coarsening, resulting in a smaller number of larger clusters, whereas long-term memory inhibits aggregation and increases the proportion of isolated individuals. Statistical analysis demonstrates that extended memory reduces the agents' responsiveness to environmental stimuli, explaining the transition from aggregation to dispersion as $K$ increases. These findings identify memory as a key factor controlling the collective organization of self-driven agents and provide a bridge between individual-level dynamics and emergent spatial patterns.",

However, their innate deterministic feature has partially detracted their robustness to noisy system, and their inability to offer uncertainty measurement has also been an insufficiency of the framework. On the other hand, the traditional state-space model framework is robust to noise. It also carries measured uncertainty, forming a just-right complement to the reservoir computing and deep sequential model framework. We propose the unscented reservoir smoother, a model that unifies both deep sequential and state-space models to achieve both frameworks' superiorities.

We test these predictions in a controllable aeroacoustic self oscillator, i.e, a whistle, that exhibits a robust limit cycle and is subject to external acoustic forcing with programmable frequency and amplitude modulation. Under both slowly varying frequency or amplitude of the forcing, three regimes are observed: (i) strict synchronization (ii) intermittent synchronization, characterized by alternating phase locking and brief phase slip episodes and (iii) no synchronization, with regular phase slips. Particularly in strict synchronization regime, the phase of the oscillator will follow arbitrary slowly-varying drive phase and under amplitude modulation its amplitude fluctuations are strongly suppressed.",

However, none of these simple systems are chemical dynamical systems (CDSs) - a special subset of polynomial DSs that model the dynamics of mass-action chemical reaction networks (CRNs).

To bridge this gap, in this paper we prove some basic properties of chaotic CDSs, including that those in three dimensions have at least 6 monomials, at least one of which is negative and quadratic. We then use these results to computationally find 20 chaotic three-dimensional CDSs with 6 monomials and as few as 4 quadratics, or 7 monomials and as few as 2 quadratics.

We show that delay seriously affects the resulting dynamics and may lead to the loss of stability of equilibria when critical delay is exceeded. We provide theoretical tools for the assessment of the critical delays and the parameter values when this may happen. Our results emphasize the importance of the mechanisms of density dependence. We analyze the impact of three different suppression modes based on: adult mortality, juvenile recruitment survival after the maturation period (without delay), and juvenile recruitment at birth (with the delay). The last mode leads to extreme patterns such as bifurcations, complex cycles, and chaotic dynamics. However, surprisingly, this mode leads to extension of the duration of the temporary transient metastable states known as \"ghost attractors\".

Using particle transmissivity as a confinement criterion, identical-mode pairs exhibit phase-controlled behavior: anti-phase waves produce destructive interference and strong confinement while in-phase waves add constructively and drive chaotic transport. Mode-mismatched pairs produce richer phase-space structure with higher-order resonances and sticky regions; the transmissivity boundaries become geometrically complex. Box-counting dimensions quantify this: integer dimension smooth boundaries for identical modes versus non-integer fractal-like dimension for distinct modes, demonstrating that phase and spectral content of waves jointly determine whether interference suppresses or promotes transport.",

Despite four decades of study, a unified computational framework reconciling its stochastic algorithm, universal fractal dimension, multifractal growth measure, and finite-size effects remains essential for applications from materials science to geomorphology. Through large-scale simulations (clusters up to $N = 10^6$ particles) in two dimensions, we perform a tripartite analysis: (1) We establish a definitive finite-size scaling collapse, extracting the universal fractal dimension $D = 1.712 \\pm 0.015$ and identifying the crossover to boundary-dominated growth at a scaled mass $x_0 \\approx 0.10 \\pm 0.02$. (2) We quantify the full multifractal spectrum of the harmonic measure ($\\Delta\\alpha \\approx 1.13$), directly linking the stochastic algorithm to the deterministic Laplacian growth equation $\\nabla^2 p = 0$ and explaining the screening effect via an exponential decay $\\eta \\sim e^{-r/\\xi}$ with screening length $\\xi = 22.7 \\pm 0.8$ lattice units.

Here we show that a nontrivial fixed point generically does exist in the $\\textit{complex}$ coupling plane and is described by a complex conformal field theory (CCFT). This CCFT fixed point is generic in the sense that it has a single relevant singlet operator, and is thus expected to arise in any non-Hermitian model with $O(N)$ symmetry upon tuning a single complex parameter. We confirm this prediction numerically by locating the CCFT at $N = 3$ in a non-Hermitian spin-1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, finding good agreement between the complex central charge and scaling dimensions and those obtained by analytic continuation of real fixed points from $N\\leq 2$. We further construct a realistic Lindbladian for a spin-1 chain whose no-click dynamics are governed by the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian realizing the CCFT.

For quasi-one-dimensional fluids, we show that this symmetry-protected charge diffusion is not smoothly connected to the normal diffusion that arises when momentum conservation is broken by noise (or static impurities). Instead, the charge diffusion constant is a discontinuous function of noise, which (in the weak-noise limit) depends only on the ratio of momentum and energy relaxation rates. In the special limit of momentum-conserving noise (e.g., spatially uniform fluctuations of the Hamiltonian), the diffusion constant diverges in the presence of noise. We describe the resulting superdiffusion in terms of coupled Burgers equations. We present a general mechanism--hydrodynamic recoupling--by which weak noise can induce singular changes in transport coefficients.

In the context of spin systems, it represents the population of the sublevels of the magnetization in the $z$-direction. We use this quantity to probe the onset of thermalization in the isolated quantum and classical one-dimensional spin-1 Ising model with transverse and longitudinal fields. Thermalization is achieved when the long-time average of the occupation number converges to the microcanonical prediction as the chain length $L$ increases, consistent with the emergence of ergodicity. However, the finite-size scaling analysis in the quantum model is challenged by the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with $L$. To overcome this limitation, we turn to the corresponding classical model, which enables access to much larger system sizes. By tracking the dynamics of individual spins on their three-dimensional Bloch spheres and employing tools from random matrix theory, we establish a quantitative criterion for classical ergodicity in interacting spin systems. We find that deviations from classical ergodicity decay algebraically with system size. This power-law scaling then provides a quantitative bound on the approach to thermal equilibrium in the quantum model.",

At finite temperature, if a polymer is shorter than its persistence length, the polymer is semiflexible, and its elasticity remains rod-like. But polymers can also stretch due to their finite extensibility, which can couple to energetically cheap bending deformations in nonlinear ways when a load is applied to the system. We show how the interplay between thermal fluctuations and nonlinear elasticity dramatically modifies the Euler buckling instability for compressed semiflexible polymers in a fixed strain ensemble. We identify a Ginzburg-like length scale beyond which thermally excited undulations lead to a softened Young's modulus, while the polymer nevertheless remains semiflexible. Both perturbative calculations and numerical Monte Carlo simulations suggest a qualitative change in several scaling properties of the buckling transition. The critical compressional strain for thermal buckling now increases with system size, in contrast to athermal buckling, where it decreases with system size. Renormalization group calculations confirm this picture, and also show that thermal buckling is controlled by a new fixed point with different critical exponents compared to classical Euler buckling.",

The partially ordered phase is characterized by formation of a ring-like assembly of the slower particles while the faster particles diffuse randomly. Two concentric rings, comprising faster and slower particles, form in the fully ordered phase.

Here we take a transformation-based approach and experimentally examine transitions between nonequilibrium steady states (NESS). Using an optically trapped microparticle driven by a tunable correlated stochastic force, we generate active-like steady states with controllable noise statistics. By abruptly changing the trap stiffness, we measure the stochastic work, heat, and entropy produced during NESS-to-NESS transformations. We identify a state-dependent effective temperature that restores the second law for these transitions, enabling the definition of a generalized work that incorporates the consequence of the nonequilibrium fluctuations. With this quantity, we derive and experimentally verify a Crooks-like fluctuation relation linking work distributions to a nonequilibrium free-energy difference defined through the effective temperature. Finally, we establish a fluctuation-response relation for the positional variance following stiffness changes. We demonstrate that this relation is key to distinguishing systems that can be described by a unique effective temperature (i.e., those under equilibrium or white-noise conditions) from those under colored-noise, where an equilibrium-like response cannot be restored. These results delineate the applicability and limits of effective-temperature thermodynamics in driven systems.",

Here, we introduce a new foundation for this friction-tensor formalism for conservatively driven systems. Under complete control of the potential energy, a global thermodynamic manifold (on which points are identified with instantaneous energy landscapes) has as its metric a full-control friction tensor. Arbitrary partial-control friction tensors arise naturally as inherited metrics on submanifolds of this global manifold. Leveraging a simple mathematical relationship between system dynamics and the geometry of the global manifold, we derive new expressions for the friction tensor that offer powerful tools for interpretation and computation of friction tensors and minimum-work protocols.

We derive exact, computationally tractable expressions for these quantities, valid in arbitrary nonequilibrium steady states of Markov jump processes. Both components are expressed in terms of excess observables, a notion central to both statistical physics and reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we establish thermodynamic upper bounds for antisymmetric covariances in terms of (pseudo-)entropy production and cycle affinities. Finally, we show that the speed up of self-averaging induced by nonequilibrium drivings which preserve kinetics (activity) is bounded by the cycle affinities (thermodynamic forces).",

    "summary": "arXiv:2507.18379v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The $q$-state Potts model is a fundamental model in statistical physics that generalizes the Ising model and plays a key role in the study of phase transitions, critical phenomena, complex systems, and combinatorial optimization. Sampling low-energy configurations of the $q$-state Potts model is essential to these studies, but it remains challenging. While physics-inspired dynamical sampling has been extensively explored for the Ising case ($q=2$) in the form of Ising machines, its generalization to general $q$-state Potts models remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we propose a class of physics-inspired dynamical samplers that directly target general $q$-state Potts models, which we refer to as the oscillator Potts machine (OPM). We show, through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, that the OPM exhibits a systematic low-energy bias with respect to the underlying Potts energy landscape. Furthermore, we demonstrate, via phase perturbation analysis, that the OPM, as overdamped Langevin dynamics, can be realized with a network of self-sustaining oscillators, demonstrating that the OPM is naturally realizable in hardware using standard technology such as CMOS. We design a small-scale ring-oscillator circuit that implements a three-state OPM and validate its operation through transistor-level simulation. Leveraging the low-energy bias of the OPM for Potts models, we then apply it to large-scale max-$K$-cut problems by mapping these instances to $q$-state Potts Hamiltonians and compare its performance against established algorithms. Our results position the OPM as a promising, physically grounded dynamical system framework for multi-state sampling and combinatorial optimization.",

The PMF determines the correction to the equilibrium Gibbs distribution, but it is generally unclear how to implement the concept for time-dependent phenomena described by a (generalized) Langevin equation. We study a model where the system is a single particle (so there are no complications related to internal forces) and a non-trivial PMF is due to the presence of on-site (anchor) potentials applied to the bath particles. We found that the PMF does not merely replace the external potential, but also makes the dissipation kernel and statistical properties of noise dependent on the system's position. That dependence is determined by the internal bath and system-bath interactions and is a priori unknown. Therefore, in the general case the Langevin equation with the PMF is not closed and thus inoperable. However, for systems with linear forces the aforementioned dependence on the system's position is canceled. As an example, we consider a model where the bath is formed by the Klein-Gordon chain, i. e. a harmonic chain with on-site harmonic potentials. In that case, the generalized Langevin equation has the standard form with an external potential replaced by a quadratic PMF.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2503.15483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: A central challenge in quantum error correction is identifying powerful quantum codes tailored to specific hardware and determining their error thresholds above which quantum information is unprotected. This problem is hard because we cannot determine the noise models for our devices. Inspired by the quantum capacity theorem, we seek an optimal quantum source of information, namely the density matrix that degrades minimally when passed through a noisy channel. We explore this idea with the Open Random Unitary Model (ORUM), a simplified model of a $N$-qubit quantum computer with competing depolarizing and dephasing channels as a stand-in for unitary gates and measurements. Through numerical optimization, we find that the ORUM hosts three discrete regimes, three \"phases\", the \"maximally mixed source\" phase, a \"$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ source\" phase (where ORUM's $U(1)$ gauge symmetry is broken down to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$), and a no-coding phase where all information is lost. These phases exhibit first-order transitions among themselves and converge at a novel zero-capacity multicritical point. These results show a remarkable similarity between the quantum capacity theorem and Jaynes' maximum entropy principle of statistical mechanics. Using the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ source, we build two codes, a classical cat code capable of correcting all the dephasing errors and a concatenated cat code capable of correcting all errors up to a distance $d=\\text{min}(m,N)$ and reduces to Shor's 9-qubit code for $m=N=3$. Neither classical nor quantum code survives near the vicinity of the zero-capacity multicritical point in the source phase diagram. Applying our approach to current noisy devices could provide a systematic method for constructing quantum codes for robust computation and communication.",

To address this, we propose two population based evolutionary algorithms for general dynamic games with linear or nonlinear dynamics and arbitrary objective functions: a co evolutionary genetic algorithm and a hybrid genetic algorithm particle swarm optimization scheme.

Participatory budgeting mathematically generalizes multiwinner elections, and both have received great attention in computational social choice recently. A well-studied notion of group fairness in this setting is core stability: Each voter is assigned an \"entitlement\" of $\\frac{k}{n}$, so that a subset $S$ of voters can pay for a committee of size at most $|S| \\cdot \\frac{k}{n}$. A given committee is in the core if no subset of voters can pay for another committee that provides each of them strictly larger utility. This provides proportional representation to all voters in a strong sense.\n  In this paper, we study the following auditing question: Given a committee computed by some preference aggregation method, how close is it to the core? Concretely, how much does the entitlement of each voter need to be scaled down by, so that the core property subsequently holds? As our main contribution, we present computational hardness results for this problem, as well as a logarithmic approximation algorithm via linear program rounding. We show that our analysis is tight against the linear programming bound. Additionally, we consider two related notions of group fairness that have similar audit properties. The first is Lindahl priceability, which audits the closeness of a committee to a market clearing solution. We show that this is related to the linear programming relaxation of auditing the core, leading to efficient exact and approximation algorithms for auditing.

This strong notion implicitly assumes that the manipulating agent either knows what all other agents are going to report, or is willing to take the risk and act as-if she knows their reports.\n  Without knowledge of the others' reports, most manipulations are \\emph{risky} -- they might decrease the manipulator's utility for some other combinations of reports by the other agents. Accordingly, a recent paper (Bu, Song and Tao, ``On the existence of truthful fair cake cutting mechanisms'', Artificial Intelligence 319 (2023), 103904) suggests a relaxed notion, which we refer to as \\emph{risk-avoiding truthfulness (RAT)}, which requires only that no agent can gain from a \\emph{safe} manipulation -- one that is sometimes beneficial and never harmful.\n  Truthfulness and RAT are two extremes: the former considers manipulators with complete knowledge of others, whereas the latter considers manipulators with no knowledge at all. In reality, agents often know about some -- but not all -- of the other agents. This paper introduces the \\emph{RAT-degree} of a mechanism, defined as the smallest number of agents whose reports, if known, may allow another agent to safely manipulate, or $n$ if there is no such number. This notion interpolates between classic truthfulness (degree $n$) and RAT (degree at least $1$): a mechanism with a higher RAT-degree is harder to manipulate safely.\n  To illustrate the generality and applicability of this concept, we analyze the RAT-degree of prominent mechanisms across various social choice settings, including auctions, indivisible goods allocations, cake-cutting, voting, and two-sided matching.",

Traditionally, pragmatic compromises are made, such as selecting an optimal subset of parameters for estimation and fixing non-influential parameters. Kalman filters are typically used for dynamical state tracking, to facilitate the control u at every time step. However, for the purpose of parameter estimation, this constraint no longer applies. Our modification has transformed the utility of UKF for the parameter estimation purpose, including minimally influential parameters, with excellent robustness (i.e., under severe noise corruption, challenging patho-physiology, and no prior knowledge of parameter distributions). The modified UKF algorithm is robust in recovering almost all parameters to over 98% accuracy, over 90% of the time, with a challenging target data set of 50, 10-parameter samples.

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02802v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The task of jointly communicating a message and reconstructing a common estimate of the channel state is examined for a fading Gaussian model with additive state interference. The state is an independent and identically distributed Gaussian sequence known noncausally at the transmitter, and the instantaneous fading coefficient is perfectly known at both the transmitter and the receiver. The receiver is required to decode the transmitted message and, in addition, reconstruct the state under a common reconstruction constraint ensuring that its estimate coincides with that at the transmitter. A complete characterization of the optimal rate distortion tradeoff region for this setting is the main result of our work. The analytical results are also validated through numerical examples illustrating the rate distortion and power distortion tradeoffs.",

The conventional methods, i.e., the fractional programming (FP) method and the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, can be computationally demanding for two reasons: (i) they require inverting a sequence of matrices whose sizes are proportional to the number of antennas; (ii) they require tuning a set of Lagrange multipliers to account for the power constraints. The recently proposed method called the reduced WMMSE addresses the above two issues for a single cell. In contrast, for the multicell case, another recent method called the FastFP eliminates the large matrix inversion and the Lagrange multipliers by using an improved FP technique, but the update stepsize in the FastFP can be difficult to decide. As such, we propose integrating the deep unfolding network into the FastFP for the stepsize optimization. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method is much more efficient than the learning method based on the WMMSE algorithm.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02855v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Linear queries, as the basis of broad analysis tasks, are often released through privacy mechanisms based on differential privacy (DP), the most popular framework for privacy protection. However, DP adopts a context-free definition that operates independently of the data-generating distribution. In this paper, we revisit the privacy analysis of the Laplace mechanism through the lens of pointwise maximal leakage (PML). We demonstrate that the distribution-agnostic definition of the DP framework often mandates excessive noise. To address this, we incorporate an assumption about the prior distribution by lower-bounding the probability of any single record belonging to any specific class. With this assumption, we derive a tight, context-aware leakage bound for general linear queries, and prove that our derived bound is strictly tighter than the standard DP guarantee and converges to the DP guarantee as this probability lower bound approaches zero. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that by exploiting this prior knowledge, the required noise scale can be reduced while maintaining privacy guarantees.",

Consider a distributed system with $K$ users, where each user $k\\in [K]$ holds a data stream $W_k$ and an individual key $Z_k$. A server aims to compute a linear function $\\mathbf{F}[W_1;\\ldots;W_K]$ without learning any information about another linear function $\\mathbf{G}[W_1;\\ldots;W_K]$, where $[W_1;\\ldots;W_K]$ denotes the row stack of $W_1,\\ldots,W_K$. The open problem is to determine the minimum required length of $Z_k$, denoted as $R_k$, $k\\in [K]$. In this paper, we characterize a new achievable region for the rate tuple $(R_1,\\ldots,R_K)$. The region is polyhedral, with vertices characterized by a binary rate assignment $(R_1,\\ldots,R_K) = (\\mathbf{1}(1 \\in \\mathcal{I}),\\ldots,\\mathbf{1}(K\\in \\mathcal{I}))$, where $\\mathcal{I}\\subseteq [K]$ satisfies the \\textit{rank-increment condition}: $\\mathrm{rank}\\left(\\bigl[\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathcal{I}};\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathcal{I}}\\bigr]\\right) =\\mathrm{rank}\\bigl(\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathcal{I}}\\bigr)+N$.

Here, we advance this method in two complementary directions. First, we extend the method using a regularizer based on the total generalized variation (TGV) norm, in order to reconstruct a larger class of noise spectra, namely piecewise-linear noise spectra, which more realistically model many physical systems. We show through numerical simulations that the new method resolves finer spectral features, while maintaining an order-of-magnitude speedup over conventional approaches to noise spectroscopy. Second, we simplify the experimental implementation of the method, by introducing Rademacher measurements for reconstructing sparse noise spectra. These measurements use pseudorandom pulse sequences that can be generated in real time from a short random seed, reducing experimental complexity without compromising reconstruction accuracy. Together, these developments broaden the reach of random pulse sequences for accurate and efficient noise characterization in realistic quantum systems.",

Across image recognition and whole-slide imaging (WSI) subtyping benchmarks, NCMI-trained models surpass state of the art losses by substantial margins at a computational cost comparable to that of CE. Notably, on ImageNet, NCMI yields a 2.77% top-1 accuracy improvement with ResNet-50 comparing to the CE; on CAMELYON-17, replacing CE with NCMI improves the macro-F1 by 8.6% over the strongest baseline.

This paper introduces the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel-Upper Confidence Bound (QNTK-UCB) algorithm, a novel algorithm that leverages the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel (QNTK) to address these limitations.\n  By freezing the QNN at a random initialization and utilizing its static QNTK as a kernel for ridge regression, QNTK-UCB bypasses the unstable training dynamics inherent in explicit parameterized quantum circuit training while fully exploiting the unique quantum inductive bias. For a time horizon $T$ and $K$ actions, our theoretical analysis reveals a significantly improved parameter scaling of $\\Omega((TK)^3)$ for QNTK-UCB, a substantial reduction compared to $\\Omega((TK)^8)$ required by classical NeuralUCB algorithms for similar regret guarantees. Empirical evaluations on non-linear synthetic benchmarks and quantum-native variational quantum eigensolver tasks demonstrate QNTK-UCB's superior sample efficiency in low-data regimes. This work highlights how the inherent properties of QNTK provide implicit regularization and a sharper spectral decay, paving the way for achieving ``quantum advantage'' in online learning.",

While belief states are sufficient for SOC in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), they are generally infinite-dimensional and impractical. We interpret truncated input-output (IO) histories as inducing a belief approximation and develop a metric-based theory that directly relates information loss to control performance. Using the Wasserstein metric, we derive policy-conditional performance bounds that quantify value degradation induced by finite memory along typical closed-loop trajectories. Our analysis proceeds via a fixed-policy comparison: we evaluate two cost functionals under the same closed-loop execution and isolate the effect of replacing the true belief by its finite memory approximation inside the belief-level cost. For linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) systems, we provide closed-form belief mismatch evaluation and empirically validate the predicted mechanism, demonstrating that belief mismatch decays approximately exponentially with memory length and that the induced performance mismatch scales accordingly. Together, these results provide a metric-aware characterization of what finite memory belief approximation can and cannot achieve in PO settings.",

While block error rate (BLER) is a common metric, it does not distinguish between confusions and erasures, which can have significantly different impacts in cross-layer protocol design, despite upper-layer protocols universally assuming physical (PHY) errors manifest as packet erasures rather than undetected corruptions - an assumption lacking rigorous PHY-layer validation. We present a systematic analysis of confusions and erasures under BLER-constrained maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. Through sphere-packing analysis, we provide analytical bounds for both block confusion and erasure probabilities, and derive the sensitivities of these bounds to blocklength and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on this topic in the FBL regime. Our findings provide theoretical validation for the block erasure channel abstraction commonly assumed in medium access control (MAC) and network layer protocols, confirming that, for practical FBL codes, block confusions are negligible compared to block erasures, especially at large blocklengths and high SNR.",

Mass spectrometry, combined with fragment correlation analysis and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, is used to identify the molecular origin of the neutral and ionic products. Singly ionized AB produces neutral H and H2, while doubly ionized AB produces neutral H and H2 along with H+, H2+, and H3+, all within 1 ps. Electronic-structure calculations show that H, H+, H2, H2+, and H3+ originate predominantly from hydrogen atoms bound to the boron center and that their formation proceeds through hydrogen migration and, in some channels, neutral H2 roaming. The calculations further indicate that the dication meets the structural and energetic requirements for neutral H2 release, a prerequisite for forming astrochemically relevant H3+. However, the large adiabatic relaxation energy causes most roaming H2 to dissociate before proton abstraction, suppressing H3+ formation. These results provide new insight into dissociative ionization pathways in hydrogen-rich molecules, extend mechanistic principles developed for halogenated alkanes to ammonia borane, and suggest implications for hydrogen-release chemistry in ammonia-borane-based storage materials.",

Infrared (IR) spectra of HCl, H2O, NH3, and acetone are mapped into the audible range using a simple anharmonic oscillator model and NIST vibrational data. Comparing harmonic and anharmonic sonifications reveals systematic pitch flattening, beating, and the emergence of combination bands, which are analyzed with spectrograms and autocorrelation functions. A time-dependent model of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) in acetone, implemented by \"plucking\" a single mode, produces evolving sound textures that mirror energy flow through the molecule. These results suggest that sonified IR spectra can provide an intuitive, pedagogical window into anharmonicity, mode coupling, and IVR.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02869v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Solid-state batteries (SSB) are emerging as next-generation electrochemical energy storage devices. Achieving high energy density in SSB relies on solid polymer electrolytes (SPE) that are electrochemically stable against both lithium metal and high-potential positive electrodes, two conditions that are difficult to satisfy without chemical degradation. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate the relationship between structure and dynamics in carbonate-based SPE composed of polypropylene carbonate and lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF$_6$), at salt concentrations ranging from 0.32 to 1.21 mol$/$kg. Structural properties are analyzed under ambient pressure at the experimentally relevant temperature $T = 353$ K. Since the slow dynamical processes governing ion transport in these systems are inaccessible to direct molecular dynamics, transport properties are simulated at elevated temperatures up to 900 K and extrapolated to $T = 353$ K using Arrhenius behavior. The results reveal strong ionic correlations, a limited fraction of free ions, and a predominance of negatively charged clusters, especially at high salt concentration. At high temperature, the self-diffusion coefficient of Li$^+$ exceeds that of PF$_6^-$ due to weaker Li$^+$-carbonate and ion-ion interactions. However, at $T = 353$ K, Li$^+$ mobility becomes lower than that of the anion, consistent with typical experimental observations in SPE. As expected, the ionic conductivity $\\sigma$ increases with temperature, while at $T = 353$ K it exhibits a maximum for salt concentrations between 1.0 and 1.1 mol$/$kg. Overall, the estimated physico-chemical parameters highlight the key role of ion correlations in SPE and suggest strategies to optimize electrolyte performance. The Arrhenius extrapolation approach used here provides valuable insight into ion transport mechanisms in solid polymer electrolytes.",

Here, we overturn this paradigm by transforming two classic degradation mechanisms, acidic corrosion and hydrogen embrittlement, into a constructive materials-design strategy. We demonstrate that synergistic control of these processes in acid enables the in-situ engineering of a \"hydrogen-trapping cage\" (HTC) microstructure within metals. Composed of a dense defect network, this cage directly captures and stabilizes protons as hydrides under mild conditions, guided by the universal criterion |DeltaPeq| > DeltaPph. Using this platform, we synthesize over 20 hydrides, including challenging targets such as LiH and NaH, and showcase its functional power with a cage-rich titanium hydride electrocatalyst. This catalyst achieves an exceptional current density of 1.07 A cm-2 for nitrate-to-ammonia conversion, attributed to rapid H- transport within the engineered cage.

The quality of the product is closely related to the fluid and mixing dynamics inside the mixers. Due to the rapid time scales and small sizes of many turbulent mixing geometries, computational fluid dynamics simulations have been the primary tool used to predict and understand fluid behavior within these mixers. In this study, we used the residual-based variational multiscale finite element method to perform high-fidelity turbulent simulations on two commonly used turbulent mixers: the multi-inlet vortex mixer (MIVM) and the confined impinging jets mixer (CIJM). We simulated two geometric variations, two-inlets and four-inlets, of the MIVM and two different inflow ratios of the CIJM. Through detailed turbulence results, we identify differences in turbulence onset, total energy, and mixing performance of the two MIVM configurations. With the CIJM results, we demonstrate the effect of the flow rate ratio on the impingement behavior, and as a result, on the mixing performance and turbulence. The cross-comparison between the two mixers shows key differences in turbulence and mixing behaviors, such as the turbulence onset, the energy decay, and the output mixing index. This study demonstrates the importance of a high-accuracy numerical scheme in simulating the turbulent mixers and understanding the similarities and differences among mixers. Furthermore, the results show potential for optimizing the operating conditions to achieve the best mixing performance.",

In this work, we address a fundamental question: what is the minimum number of free parameters required to accurately represent numerical solutions of the GS equation under fixed-boundary conditions? We demonstrate that, for most practical applications, GS equilibria can be represented using only 2--5 free parameters while maintaining relative errors below 5\\%. For higher-accuracy requirements, we introduce a unified spectral representation based on the Miller extended harmonic (MXH) expansion in the poloidal direction combined with shifted Chebyshev (Cheb) polynomials in the radial direction. This MXH--Cheb basis exhibits rapid convergence for two-dimensional GS equilibria. For configurations where three geometric moments (shift, elongation, and triangularity) are specified at the last closed flux surface (LCFS), relative errors on the order of $10^{-2}$--$10^{-3}$ can be achieved using as few as 13--20 parameters. In more general cases, including up--down asymmetric equilibria, X-point configurations, and stiff pressure and current profiles (e.g., H-mode pedestals), accuracies beyond this level can be obtained with fewer than 100 parameters. The resulting equilibrium configurations and profile functions are fully analytical, with smooth derivatives of all orders. These results provide a systematic foundation for developing high-fidelity, ultra-fast GS solvers and enable efficient reduced-order and AI-based surrogate modeling of tokamak equilibria.",

In these frameworks, a reverse generative process reconstructs physical fields from standard Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries. The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples. The results demonstrate that Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet achieve more accurate predictions of velocity and pressure fields, as well as lift and drag forces, and exhibit greater robustness to incomplete geometries compared to a vanilla PointNet with the same number of trainable parameters.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.03224v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The coil in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) determines the spatial shape of the electromagnetic field in the head, which structures are concurrently activated, and how focal stimulation is. Most of the readily available coils have been designed intuitively instead of systematic mathematical-physical optimization as there were no methods available at the time. Previous research however demonstrated that these coils are far from optimum, e.g., for pulse energy or efficiency, and leave substantial room for lots of improvements. Techniques for rigorous mathematical optimization have been developed but are only available to very few groups worldwide. This paper presents an open-source toolbox, COMATOSE, to change that situation and make these methods available to a wider community. It incorporates the fundamental formalisms and offers vector space decomposition as well as base mapping as an explicit forward method, which is computationally less demanding than iterative computational optimization but can also form the initial solution for a subsequent optimization run if desired.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.11541v5 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Plasmonic nanostructures provide electric field localization to be used as a fluorescence enhancement tool for the closely located fluorophores. However, metallic structures exhibit non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which suppresses the boost in the photoluminescence spectrum due to inhomogeneous medium. Compensation to non-radiative losses is fundamentally restricted, therefore defining the critical interparticle distances, where the fluorescence enhancement is detectable hold utmost importance for device applications. In this work, we numerically identified the critical interparticle distances of a metal nanoparticle (MNP) and quantum emitters (QEs) with angstrom resolution by analyzing the interplay between quantum yield and non-radiative decay. By engaging a collimated light application on silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance, we simulated an active fluorescence enhancement switch yielding observable 7-fold increase in fluorescence intensity. The provided free space simulation includes the complete response of AgNP with retardation and higher order multi-polar effects for which the previous analytical works fall short. While the model bridges the absorption and emission spectra via corresponding Stokes shift values and presents a general approach for the interaction of QEs and MNPs in Rayleigh regime, it can be extended to Mie regime for larger QEs and can be modified for dielectric device environment.",

PBA effect drives significant interatomic electron accumulation when electron energy exceeds the barrier maximum. This effect essentially determines interatomic electron density patterns, governing microstructures and properties of condensed matters.

    "summary": "arXiv:2512.19407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We present a Cartesian cut-cell finite-volume method for sharp-interface two-phase diffusion problems in static geometries. The formulation follows a two-fluid approach: independent diffusion equations are discretized in each phase on a fixed Cartesian grid, while the phases are coupled through embedded interface conditions enforcing continuity of diffusive flux and a general jump law. Cut cells are treated by integrating the governing equations over phase-restricted control volumes and surfaces, yielding discrete divergence and gradient operators that are locally conservative within each phase. Interface coupling is achieved by introducing a small set of interfacial unknowns per cut cell on the embedded boundary; the resulting algebraic system involves only bulk and interfacial averages. A key feature of the method is the use of a reduced set of geometric information based solely on low-order moments (trimmed volumes, apertures and interface measures/centroids), allowing robust implementation without constructing explicitly cut-cell polytopes. The method supports steady (Poisson) and unsteady (diffusion) regimes and incorporates Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin boundary conditions and general jumps. We validate the scheme on one-, two- and three-dimensional single-phase and two-phase benchmarks, including curved embedded boundaries, Robin conditions and strong property/jump contrasts. The results demonstrate a superlinear convergence behavior, sharp enforcement of interfacial laws and excellent conservation properties. Extensions to moving interfaces and Stefan-type free-boundary problems are natural perspectives of this framework.",

We summarize current HT applications spanning subcellular phenotyping, metabolic and mechanical profiling, and early-stage clinical studies in areas such as infectious disease and pathology.

Cellular membranes are strongly linked to a supporting cytoskeleton. However, in most previous studies, the effect of this cortical network somehow is overlooked. In this paper, we study the cellular wrapping of a membrane around a 2D elastic particle in the presence of a substrate mimicking cytoskeleton. Our simulations show that the impact of particle flexibility on the wrapping process depends on the magnitude of the membrane particle adhesion. In contrast, the extent of membrane protrusions formed around the target always increases with target stiffness. Since the extension of membrane protrusions is an essential step in the phagocytosis process, this result may indicate a selective behavior of macrophages in the phagocytosis of aged red blood cells.",

Quantitative analysis reveals the dominance of dynamical steady-state sheet-like interfaces, in marked difference from the transient bicontinuous structures observed in passive liquid-liquid phase separation, where saddle-like surfaces dominate.

Monte Carlo simulations using the Metropolis algorithm on a restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) lattice model demonstrate that intrinsic step jamming persists on surfaces below 20 nm. In the present model, transport processes such as surface and volume diffusion are excluded, as are elastic interactions, step-step repulsion or attraction, and stoichiometric effects. We show that intrinsic step jamming arises from asymmetric fluctuations in atomic attachment and detachment driven by biased transition probabilities under the SOS restriction, leading to collective step congestion. Asymmetric fluctuations also determine whether adatom or hole clusters grow or recede. This mechanism bears close similarity to jamming phenomena in the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), including multi-lane variants. In contrast, symmetric thermal fluctuations generate adatom or hole clusters on terraces, thereby suppressing intrinsic step jamming. Possible routes to suppress intrinsic step jamming, including experimentally accessible strategies, are also discussed.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02810v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The shape-preserving and shape-altering collisions of dark solitons are investigated in the complex modified Korteweg-de Vries equation. The obtained dark soliton solutions are classified into two distinct types, referred to as type-I and type-II dark solitons, which exhibit fundamentally different structural and dynamical characteristics. A single type-I dark soliton is symmetric about its center and admits three distinct valley profiles, namely single-valley, double-valley, and flat-bottom structures, whereas a single type-II dark soliton only supports a single-valley profile. These two types of dark solitons differ in their phase behaviors as the spatial variable varies from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$, as well as in their velocity--amplitude relations. For multiple pure type-I dark solitons, collisions are shape-preserving; however, a nontrivial collective effect is revealed in which modifying the parameters of one soliton can induce changes in the profiles and amplitudes of the other solitons, even though all collisions remain elastic in nature. In contrast, multiple pure type-II dark solitons behave independently, undergoing only phase shifts without any modification of their shapes or amplitudes. When type-I and type-II dark solitons coexist, their interactions lead to genuine shape-altering collisions, where the valley structures and amplitudes of type-I dark solitons are modified, while type-II solitons remain unaffected except for phase shifts. Asymptotic analysis further shows that the influence of type-II dark solitons on type-I dark solitons is confined to the pre-collision stage and disappears after the interaction.",

To bridge this gap, in this paper we prove some basic properties of chaotic CDSs, including that those in three dimensions have at least 6 monomials, at least one of which is negative and quadratic. We then use these results to computationally find 20 chaotic three-dimensional CDSs with 6 monomials and as few as 4 quadratics, or 7 monomials and as few as 2 quadratics.

We show that delay seriously affects the resulting dynamics and may lead to the loss of stability of equilibria when critical delay is exceeded. We provide theoretical tools for the assessment of the critical delays and the parameter values when this may happen. Our results emphasize the importance of the mechanisms of density dependence. We analyze the impact of three different suppression modes based on: adult mortality, juvenile recruitment survival after the maturation period (without delay), and juvenile recruitment at birth (with the delay). The last mode leads to extreme patterns such as bifurcations, complex cycles, and chaotic dynamics. However, surprisingly, this mode leads to extension of the duration of the temporary transient metastable states known as \"ghost attractors\".

While upstream (pay-it-forward: helping others because you were helped) and downstream (rewarding-reputation: helping those with good reputations) indirect reciprocity have been independently considered as solutions, their joint dynamics in multiplayer contexts remain unexplored. We study public goods games without self-return (often called \"others-only\" PGGs) with benefit b and cost c and analyze evolutionary dynamics for three strategies: unconditional cooperation (ALLC), unconditional defection (ALLD), and an integrated reciprocity strategy combining unconditional forwarding with reputation-based discrimination. We show that integrating upstream and downstream reciprocity can yield a globally asymptotically stable mixed equilibrium of ALLD and integrated reciprocators when b/c > 2 in the absence of complexity costs. We analytically derive a critical threshold for complexity costs. If cognitive demands exceed this threshold, the stable equilibrium disappears via a saddle-node bifurcation. Otherwise, within the stable regime, complexity costs counterintuitively stabilize the equilibrium by preventing not only ALLC but also alternative conditional strategies from invading. Rather than requiring uniformity, our model reveals one pathway to stable cooperation through strategic diversity. ALLD serves as \"evolutionary shields\" preventing system collapse while integrated reciprocators flexibly combine open and discriminative responses. This framework demonstrates how pay-it-forward broadcasting and reputation systems can jointly maintain social polymorphism including cooperation despite cognitive limitations and group size challenges, offering a potential evolutionary foundation for behavioral diversity in human societies.",

We report the outcomes and key insights from an open science community blind challenge focused on computational methods in drug discovery, using lead optimization data from the AI-driven Structure-enabled Antiviral Platform (ASAP) Discovery Consortium\u2019s pan-coronavirus antiviral discovery program, in partnership with Polaris and the OpenADMET project. This collaborative initiative invited global participants from both academia and industry to develop and apply computational methods to predict the biochemical potency and crystallographic ligand poses of small molecules against key coronavirus targets, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) main protease (Mpro), as well as multiple ADMET assay endpoints, using previously undisclosed comprehensive experimental drug discovery datasets as benchmarks. By evaluating submissions across multiple tasks and compounds, we established performance leaderboards and conducted meta-analyses to assess methodological strengths, common pitfalls, and areas for improvement. This analysis provides a foundation for best practices in real-world machine learning evaluation, grounded in community-driven benchmarking. We also highlight how next-generation platforms, such as Polaris, enable rigorous challenge design, embedded evaluation frameworks, and broad community engagement. This paper reports the collective findings of the challenge, offering a high-level overview of the data, evaluation infrastructure, and top- performing strategies. We further provide context and support for the accompanying papers authored by the challenge participants in this special issue, which explore individual approaches in greater depth. Together, these contributions aim to advance reproducible, trustworthy, and high-impact computational methods in drug discovery, and to explore best practices and pitfalls in future blind challenge design and execution, including planned initiatives for the OpenADMET project.",

    "title": "Electrochemical Direct Air Capture by Local Alkalinity Generation at Three-Dimensional Interfaces",
    "summary": "Electrochemical direct air capture (eDAC) is a promising strategy for carbon dioxide (CO2) removal, offering advantages in energy efficiency, modularity, and potential for distributed deployment. However, existing systems are limited by low capture rates, energy-intensive regeneration, and challenges in stability and scalability. Here, we present a robust eDAC platform that addresses these limitations through key architectural innovations. The system generates hydroxides locally at the air-electrode interface to improve absorption kinetics and alkalinity utilization compared to conventional bulk solvent approaches. CO2 is subsequently released via a proton-coupled electron transfer mediator, enabling low-energy regeneration and high-purity gas output. Importantly, a porous interposer extends the reactive interface three-dimensionally to enhance CO2 capture efficiency. With an optimized interposer design and a pulsed current protocol, the system achieves stable operation for over 50 hours at current densities an order of magnitude higher than those of previous eDAC demonstrations, while maintaining competitive energy consumption. Multiphysics modeling and techno-economic analysis further guide system optimization and outline a viable path toward cost-effective scalability.",

    "title": "Luminescent Zr Complexes with Long-lived Intraligand Charge Transfer Excited States",
    "summary": "Understanding and establishing design principles to tune the excited states of earth-abundant sensitizers is crucial for identifying new photosensitizers for sustainable technological advancements. Here, we report a series of three bis Zr (IV) complexes of tridentate, dianionic ligands incorporating two phenoxide donors and aza arene acceptors of increasing electron affinity (pyridine < pyrimidine < pyrazine ) that are air and water-stable. These complexes emit via thermally assisted delayed fluorescence from an intraligand charge transfer excited state with varying metal contributions. The electronic structural changes from different acceptors vary the excited state character and the photophysical properties significantly between the complexes. The variation in photophysics that includes emission lifetime (76 \u03bcs to 265 ns), intersystem crossing (ISC) lifetime ( 390 \u2013 290 ps), and the energy difference between the singlet and triplet excited states (\u2206EST. 170 -100 meV). We observe solvent-independent ISC rates when the excited state has metal contributions (acceptor = pyridine), and the ISC rates vary significantly with solvent polarity when the excited state is an intra-ligand charge transfer state (acceptor = pyrimidine and pyrazine). Transient absorption measurements provided the basis spectra and verified the metal contribution in the excited state. This work provides a basis for developing new sensitizers based on Zr (IV) by providing design principles that can be used to modulate the character of the excited state and its photophysics.",

    "title": "Unlocking Aromatic Amine Oxidation in APEX2 by Engineering the Heme Axial Ligand with Genetically Encoded N\u03b4-Vinyl Histidine",
    "summary": "The axial ligand of heme is a key determinant of reactivity in heme-dependent enzymes, yet its systematic engineering remains challenging due to the limited chemical diversity of natural amino acids. Here, we demonstrate that replacing the native histidine axial ligand with a non-natural analog provides an effective strategy to regulate heme enzyme activity. By site-specifically incorporating \u03b4Vin-H into APEX2, we reprogrammed the electronic structure of the heme center and unlocked catalytic activity toward aromatic amine substrates. Directed evolution of the APEX2-VinH enzyme yielded APEX3-VinH, which exhibits a pronounced enhancement in catalytic efficiency and robustness for aromatic amine oxidation. Notably, optimization of the \u03b4Vin-H synthetase enabled highly efficient incorporation. This work establishes axial ligand engineering via genetic code expansion as a general and powerful strategy to reprogram the catalytic repertoire of heme enzymes, with broad implications for biocatalysis and the development of next-generation proximality labeling tools.",

In this work, the oxidation process of SAM induced by gamma-radiolysis has been investigated by collision-induced dissociation tandem mass spectrometry (CID-MS2) and Infrared Multiple Photon Dissociation Spectroscopy (IRMPD) to reveal the modified sites and to characterize the 3D structure of the oxo-forms of SAM in the gas phase.

    "title": "A Chemically and Spatially Tunable Epoxide Warhead Toolkit for On-Demand Covalent Crosslinking at Protein-interaction Interfaces",
    "summary": "Abstract: Genetically encoded covalent warheads at the protein-protein interface, enable the locking of interaction from the transient complex into a stable covalent adduct, which could improve the binding affinity, selectivity, and kinetics between a protein binder and its target. Given the diverse chemical microenvironments among different interaction interfaces, achieving efficient and selective cross-linking for each case requires genetically encoded warheads capable of reacting with a broad range of nucleophilic side chains, while offering tunable crosslinking radius and reactivities. Herein, we report a series of novel epoxide bearing unnatural amino acids (EPO-UAAs) that enable precise control over both the chemical reactivity and spatial selectivity of covalent crosslinking at protein interfaces. Our results show that both the chemical reactivity and spatial compatibility of the warhead significantly influence cross-linking efficiency at the binding interface. This enables site-selective cross-linking to drug targets such as PD-L1 or HER2 by a nanobody with precision at the 1.5\u202f\u00c5 spatial scale, corresponding to a single C-C bond length difference. Furthermore, we incorporated these EPO-UAAs into the Z domain of protein A (ZPA), an antibody Fc-binding module, to develop covalent binders for the epitope-specific modification of human and murine antibodies. This platform functions as a \u2018USB\u2019 interface, enabling rapid functional derivatization of antibodies. In summary, this work provides chemically and spatially tunable epoxide warhead for \u2018on-demond\u2019 precision cross-linking at protein interfaces, opening avenues for atomic-scale manipulation of protein interactions.",

    "summary": "A new closed-form, geometry-driven framework for determining whether a chemical bond is \ngeometrically possible, and for analyzing the resulting electron cloud overlap and orbital participation, is \nintroduced. Armstrong\u2019s Probabilistic Electron Phase-Space Overlap Model (APEPM) evaluates bonding \nfeasibility by treating nonzero spatial overlap of atomic electron clouds as a necessary geometric \nprecondition for bonding, without explicit solution of the electronic wavefunction or use of variational \nquantum-mechanical methods. \nThe model combines geometric overlap formalism adapted from Armstrong\u2019s exclusion-zone \nsolvent-accessible surface area (SASA) methodology with probabilistic orbital occupancy constraints \ndefined by Armstrong\u2019s Range Exponent Electron Configuration Model (AREECM). Bonded atoms are \nrepresented as interacting probabilistic electron volumes whose effective radii and internuclear separation \ndefine, in closed form, whether electron cloud overlap exists and, if so, the size and geometry of the \nshared electron phase-space. \nWhen overlap is present, its depth is mapped onto radially partitioned orbital shells, allowing direct \nidentification of which atomic orbital regions are geometrically involved in bonding. Electron probability \nwithin these participating regions is constrained using AREECM-style minimum and maximum \noccupancy bounds, preserving normalization and exclusion principles while remaining fully \nwavefunction-free. \nBecause all electronic quantities are explicitly tethered to bond length, APEPM provides a continuous, \ngeometry-based description of bond feasibility, electron cloud overlap, and orbital-level spatial \nparticipation under changing structural conditions such as bond compression or extension. While not \nintended to replace quantum-mechanical electronic structure methods or to reproduce spectroscopic \naccuracy, APEPM offers a fast, interpretable, and physically constrained framework for screening bond \nfeasibility, analyzing electron cloud overlap, and identifying geometrically involved orbital regions in \nlarge systems, dynamic environments, and reduced-order chemical modeling.",

    "summary": "Most of the available p38 kinase inhibitors target the highly conserved ATP-binding site, thus explaining their off-target effects and toxicity. Here, we report the use of single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies to identify new highly specific inhibitors. Using phage display, we selected five anti-p38 scFv antibodies among which one fully inhibited p38 kinase activity in vitro. We showed that this scFv did not affect ATP binding, while still acting as a competitive inhibitor of ATP hydrolysis. When expressed as intrabody in the nucleus of the THP-1 human monocytic cell line, the scFv inhibited the function of endogenous p38 and induced a significant decrease in lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor  production. To gain insight into the mechanisms by which the scFv induced p38 inhibition, the scFv epitope was mapped by deep mutational scanning of p38 displayed on yeast surface and high-throughput selection by flow cytometry of p38 mutants no longer bound by the scFv. By this approach, we showed that the inhibitory scFv interacts with two helices within the C-terminal lobe of the kinase distant from the ATP-binding pocket and the docking groove. Altogether, our data show that the scFv antibody behaves as an allosteric inhibitor, constraining and maintaining p38 in an inactive form.",

    "title": "Expanding and Decoding the Chemistry of Phospholipid Headgroup in Eukaryotes",
    "summary": "Cellular membranes have diverse phospholipids, chemical differences in whose headgroups impact many biological processes. Phosphatidylcholine is an essential phospholipid for human health, but not universally required for life. The evolutionary mechanisms underlying phospholipid preferences remain poorly understood, due to the difficulty of investigating metabolite structure-activity relationships in a cellular context. Here, we developed a generalizable metabolic-rewiring method to manipulate phospholipid headgroups together and their biological effects. This approach utilizes synthetic media to hijack evolutionarily conserved phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, leveraging xenobiotics as principal precursors for scalable headgroup transformations. By identifying over 100 artificial headgroups, we expanded the chemical diversity of xenobiotic phospholipids. Unexpectedly, we discovered that subtle headgroup alterations produced distinct mammalian cellular activities. We demonstrated that chemical headgroup modifications differentially elicited structure-dependent effects on phospholipid-protein interactions, calcium dynamics, transcriptomic profiles, and stem cell differentiation. Notably, cross-species comparison revealed that human and yeast cells have different headgroup preferences critical for cell life and death. As proof-of-concept, interactome analysis identified headgroup-sensitive human microproteins vital for mitochondrial respiration, but non-conserved in yeast. These results exemplify the evolutionary diversity of key phospholipid-protein interactions, illustrating why humans depend on phosphatidylcholine. Overall, our findings establish a programmable platform for elucidating and engineering phospholipid-driven cellular functions.",

    "title": "Home is where the host is: Evolutionary history of geographic spread, host switching, and adaptive genomic signatures in two generalist Group B Streptococcus clonal groups",
    "summary": "Abstract Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a pathogen of global relevance in neonatal and maternal disease as well as bovine mastitis. Two closely related clonal groups, denoted 103 and 314 (CG103/314) have been detected in humans and cattle on multiple continents in recent decades but are poorly characterised compared to other host-generalist clades. We examined their potential origins, host-switching events and presence of a suite of genetic markers for antimicrobial resistance, virulence and host association using a newly assembled dataset of 248 CG103/314 genomes from humans, cattle, and food originating from five continents. We detected multiple host switches between humans and cattle, and significant regional differences in AMR gene distribution, possibly reflecting local differences in antimicrobial use across countries and hosts and indicating a capacity for regional adaptation to selective pressures. Across the evolutionary history of CG103/314 from both host species, the prevalence of the Lac.2 operon, a genetic marker associated with bovine host adaptation, was high, whereas the prevalence of the scpB-lmb gene pair, a genetic marker of human host adaptation in other GBS clonal groups, was very low. All isolates with scpB-lmb were associated with human disease rather than carriage. Our dataset displayed biases typical of research into multi-host pathogens, when sampling is often focused on a specific host species or setting. Consistent, balanced, contemporaneous and sympatric sampling efforts across host species and sources are needed for a full understanding of the distribution and emergence of CG103/314 and similar multi-host pathogens impacting food safety and public health.",

    "title": "Chromosome axis protein SYCP2 recruits HORMAD2 to enable meiotic synapsis quality control in mice",
    "summary": "Faithful chromosome segregation during meiosis depends on accurate recombination and synapsis of homologous chromosomes. These processes are monitored in mammals by checkpoint mechanisms involving the meiotic HORMA-domain proteins HORMAD1 and HORMAD2, which bind unsynapsed chromosome axes and promote activation of the DNA damage-response kinase ATR independently of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, no mechanism for axis recruitment of HORMAD1 or HORMAD2 had been demonstrated, nor had its role in checkpoint function been tested. We establish that a putative HORMAD-interacting region--the closure motif (CM)--within the chromosome-axis component SYCP2 is selectively required for HORMAD2, but not HORMAD1, localization. Deletion of the SYCP2 CM disrupts SYCP2-HORMAD2 complexes and prevents HORMAD2 axis binding without affecting axis assembly or recombination. Consequently, ATR accumulation and signaling on unsynapsed axes are reduced, and the prophase checkpoint malfunctions in a sexually dimorphic manner--causing aberrant elimination of synapsis-proficient spermatocytes and persistence of asynaptic oocytes. The phenotypes of SYCP2-CM-deficient and HORMAD2-null mice are indistinguishable, establishing the requirement for HORMAD2 axis recruitment in synapsis surveillance. We propose that axial recruitment generates a HORMAD2 scaffold that drives clustering-mediated ATR network activation independently of DSBs, thereby linking chromosome-axis architecture to synapsis quality control in mammalian meiosis.",

    "title": "SLBP-independent control of maternal histone mRNA",
    "summary": "Replication-dependent (RD) histones are crucial for packaging newly replicated DNA into chromatin, ensuring genome stability. In metazoans, the mRNA of RD histones is uniquely regulated through a conserved 3' stemloop bound by stemloop binding protein (SLBP). This allows cell cycle-coupled regulation of these important transcripts. However, oocytes must stabilise histone mRNAs independently of the cell cycle to ensure maternal loading to support the first embryonic divisions. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system, we discovered an SLBP-independent mechanism that ensures RD histone transcript stability during oogenesis. This is mediated by the protein complex PETISCO, bound to the effector protein TOST-1, which directly binds the histone stemloop region and maintains maternal histone mRNA levels during oogenesis and early embryogenesis. Loss of this mechanism disrupts histone homeostasis, leading to premature genome activation, mitotic defects, and embryonic lethality. Interestingly, the same complex, PETISCO, acts in piRNA biogenesis when bound to the effector PID-1, revealing an intriguing co-option of this histone mRNA homeostasis mechanism by the piRNA pathway. Our findings reveal a unique SLBP-independent mechanism of histone mRNA regulation, that served as a basis for the evolution of a novel piRNA biogenesis mechanism.",

However, these summaries do not explicitly quantify learning efficiency\u2014how much model-relevant information is gained per unit resource\u2014nor do they credit experiments that reduce uncertainty without improving observed outcomes, including negative or null results that delineate the boundaries of viable chemical space.\n\nWe propose Return on Experiment (RoE), a resource-normalized metric that couples information return to total cost. RoE is defined as \u0394I/C, where \u0394I denotes an information-gain term quantified through reduction in posterior predictive uncertainty (operationalized as domain-averaged variance reduction, entropy decrease, or improvement in held-out predictive log-score), and C denotes audited resource costs spanning both experimental expenditures (time, reagents, monetary cost, environmental impact) and computational expenditures (token usage, compute hours). RoE is reported either as per-resource values preserving interpretability across cost dimensions, or as a scalar following explicit normalization and weighting protocols.\n\nWe formalize standardized \u0394I definitions with objective normalization and reference-set specifications enabling cross-study comparison, establish calibration reporting as a gating requirement for uncertainty-based RoE interpretation, and propose a minimum reporting standard encompassing selection criteria, resource boundaries, and multi-objective handling. Illustrative applications demonstrate that RoE discriminates optimization strategies masked by single-metric reporting, credits informative negative experiments, and preserves trade-off structure in multi-objective campaigns. RoE complements existing outcome metrics by making learning efficiency an explicit, auditable, and reportable quantity for autonomous chemistry evaluation.",

    "summary": "Coding and non-coding RNAs have traditionally been viewed as functionally distinct entities. Here, we found that the down-regulation of Pink1 due to Tet2 knockout (KO) in muscle cells resulted in mitochondria dysfunction and muscle fatigue. Surprisingly, both Pink1 mRNA alone and untranslatable ATG-deficient Pink1 RNA were sufficient to rescue the mitochondria defects in Tet2 KO cells. PINK1 protein was fast degraded shortly after translation and dispensable for functions of Pink1 mRNA in muscle cells. Moreover, a portion of Pink1 mRNA was located in mitochondria and interacted directly with mitochondria inner membrane located protein YME1L1, promoting its proteolytic cleavage of Opa1, a master regulator of mitochondria fusion, to generate the mature protein form. These findings uncovered a bona fide non-coding role for a canonical mRNA, suggesting that translation independent functions could be present in mRNAs with coding potentials, blurring the conventional dichotomy between coding and non-coding RNAs.",

    "title": "Armstrongs Probabilistic Electron Phase-Space Overlap Model (APEPM)",
    "summary": "A new closed-form, geometry-driven framework for modeling electronic overlap and orbital participation is introduced. Armstrong\u2019s Probabilistic Electron Phase-Space Overlap Model (APEPM) determines electron cloud overlap and identifies which atomic orbital regions are geometrically involved in that overlap without explicit solution of the electronic wavefunction or use of variational quantum mechanical methods. The model combines geometric overlap formalism adapted from Armstrong\u2019s exclusion-zone solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) methodology with probabilistic orbital occupancy constraints defined by Armstrong\u2019s Range Exponent Electron Configuration Model (AREECM).\nIn APEPM, bonded atoms are treated as interacting probabilistic electron volumes whose effective radii define a closed-form overlap region as a function of bond length. This overlap is reinterpreted as a penetration depth into radially partitioned orbital shells, allowing identification of which electronic regions are geometrically involved in the shared electron phase-space. Probability redistribution within these regions is constrained using AREECM-style minimum and maximum occupancy bounds, preserving normalization and exclusion principles while remaining wavefunction-free.\nBecause all electronic quantities are explicitly tethered to bond length, the model provides a continuous, geometry-based description of electron cloud overlap and orbital involvement under changing structural conditions such as bond compression or extension. While not intended to replace quantum mechanical electronic structure methods or to reproduce spectroscopic accuracy, APEPM offers a fast, interpretable, and physically constrained framework for analyzing electron cloud overlap and orbital participation in large systems, dynamic environments, and reduced-order chemical modeling.",

    "title": "Comparison of nonlinear scales using atmospheric CO2 data",
    "summary": "Nonlinear monotonically increasing bounded functions help to visualize and analyze data on various scales. However, many monotonic functions such as logarithm or power laws have either function values or derivatives that become unbounded at some regions of the $x-$ axis. On the other hand, sigmoid or hyperbolic functions become saturated and functionally inactive over a wide region of the $x-$ axis. Therefore, a well-behaved function over $x\\in(-\\infty,\\infty)$ is still a fundamental requirement for data visualization and analysis. Recently introduced algebraic form $ay^3+y=mx$ with parameters $a>0$ and $m$ as slope is one such function that is both well-behaved and smooth i.e., infinitely differentiable on an $xy-$ plane. The slope of this form vanishes as $x\\rightarrow\\pm\\infty$ similar to $y=\\log x$. This form can also be interpreted as a continued fraction of $y=mx$ when expressed as $y=mx/(1+ay^2)$. The analytical real solution of the algebraic form can be interpreted as a recursion up to infinite depth. In this work, in addition to the cubic form we introduce higher order polynomials in $y$ that can be expressed as continued fraction of straight lines with tractable analytical solutions. We plot atmospheric CO$_2$ data on the continued fraction of axes for various values of $a$ and $m$.",

In the first attempts chlorine displacement by generating chlorine gas with trichloroisocyanuric acid was used to synthesize the bromine. These attempts were observed to be difficult to control, and produced an impure, low yield. To improve the process, a new method of oxidation using hydrogen peroxide was adopted. This new reaction was significantly easier to control, more optimized and resulted in a visibly larger yield. The first attempts were stored in plastic-capped glass bottles. However, this method would not contain the liquid bromine for a long period of time. Following research, a new method using custom-made hermetically sealed glass ampules was adopted for the more optimized reaction. The project shows optimization of both a chemical reaction and a safe storage method.",

    "summary": "Even in the absence of mutagenic factors, spontaneous errors in DNA replication generate genetic diversity in microbial populations. The spontaneous mutation rate is not immutable but may be conditionally elevated. However, it remains unresolved whether apparently non-stressful nutritional or genotypic conditions affect the spontaneous mutation rate. Here, we determined the spontaneous mutation rate of haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK113-7D in three nutritional and three genotypic conditions. The nutritional and genotypic conditions influenced the specific growth rate of the S. cerevisiae population. Thus, we extended the established fluctuation assay for spontaneous mutation rate determination with CAN1 as a reporter gene to populations with different generation times. We applied the method to determine the spontaneous mutations rates in wild type S. cerevisiae grown on glucose and ammonium, raffinose and ammonium, and glucose and L-tryptophan as sole carbon and nitrogen sources. Alike we determined the spontaneous mutation rates of two engineered S. cerevisiae strains (i.e., representing genotypic conditions different from wild type) on glucose and ammonium medium. The engineered strains had two to three heterologous or variant genes integrated into the genome, common to simple heterologous small molecule production host strains. In all alternative nutritional and genotypic conditions, the spontaneous mutation rate of S. cerevisiae was reduced compared to wild type growing on glucose and ammonium medium. Spontaneous mutation rate is fundamentally relevant for evolvability of strains, but it may also influence the performance robustness of microbial populations in applications such as food or beverage fermentation or biotechnological chemical production. Our novel findings are important for biotechnological processes using microbial cells, often engineered and cultivated in unnatural chemical environments.",

    "title": "Bedaquiline inhibits the ATP synthase leak channel and prevents glutamate-induced neuronal death",
    "summary": "FOF1-ATP synthase is one of the most abundant proteins of the mitochondrial inner membrane and the primary enzyme responsible for ATP production in eukaryotic cells. Nevertheless, it was recently reported to play a prominent role in cell death by forming a large-conductance leak channel in the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), making it a promising therapeutic target. Bedaquiline (BDQ), a member of the diarylquinoline class of drugs, was shown to selectively inhibit the catalytic activity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ATP synthase with no effect on the mammalian enzyme. Here, we report a new role for BDQ as a potent inhibitor of the ATP synthase c-subunit leak channel in mammals. BDQ inhibited the single-channel activity of porcine heart ATP synthase in planar lipid bilayer recordings and prevented glutamate-induced cell death in primary hippocampal neurons. These findings reveal the potential new application of BDQ for treating mPTP-related diseases by targeting the ATP synthase c-subunit leak channel.",

    "title": "Protein Language Models and Structure-Based Machine Learning for Prediction of Allosteric Binding Sites in Protein Kinases: An Explainable AI Framework Grounded in Energy Landscape-Encoded Frustration",
    "summary": "Reliable identification of allosteric binding sites remains a major bottleneck in structure-based drug discovery, particularly in protein kinase families where such sites are often structurally cryptic, evolutionarily nonconserved, and sparsely populated. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of binding site prediction across a rigorously curated dataset of human kinase-ligand complexes, encompassing 453 kinases and spanning five inhibitor classes: Type I, Type I.5, and Type II (orthosteric ATP-competitive) and Type III/IV (non-ATP allosteric) modulators. We employed the pretrained protein language model (PLM) ESM2-650M model that was fine-tuned for prediction of protein-ligand binding sites by replacing the original masked language modeling head with a token-level classification head that acts as a projection layer that maps the high-dimensional latent representation of each residue to a scalar probability score for a given protein residue to be part of the binding site. We employed this fine-tuned sequence-based PLM and structure-based detection approach P2Rank for identification of orthosteric and allosteric binding sites in protein kinases. Our analysis reveals a stark performance divergence: while both methods achieve high precision-recall (AUPR = 0.64-0.76) on orthosteric sites, PLM performance collapses on allosteric sites (AUPR = 0.06), despite retaining moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.70). This deficit persists even after strict control for sequence similarity, structural redundancy, and extreme class imbalance (allosteric residues constitute <3% of the kinase domain). To mechanistically interpret this discrepancy, we integrate large-scale local frustration analysis, a physics-based framework derived from energy landscape theory that quantifies the energetic stability of residue-residue interactions under mutational and conformational perturbations. We find that, although the global frustration landscape is conserved across kinase states dominated by neutral frustration (55-75% of residues), local binding sites exhibit fundamentally distinct mutational constraints. Orthosteric pockets are enriched in minimally frustrated residues, whereas allosteric sites are characterized by neutral mutational frustration, indicating evolutionary permissiveness and sequence degeneracy. This study reframes the performance of AI approaches in predicting protein binding sites as a reflection of functional design that can be rationalized through lens of the landscape-encoded protein frustration as an explainable AI framework.",

    "summary": "Hemagglutinins (HA) from different influenza A virus subtypes share as little as ~40% amino acid identity, yet their protein structure and cell entry function are highly conserved. Here we examine the extent that sequence constraints on HA differ across three subtypes. To do this, we first use pseudovirus deep mutational scanning to measure how all amino-acid mutations to an H7 HA affect its cell entry function. We then compare these new measurements to previously described measurements of how all mutations to H3 and H5 HAs affect cell entry function. We find that ~50% of HA sites display substantially diverged preferences for different amino acids across the HA subtypes. The sites with the most divergent amino-acid preferences tend to be buried and have biochemically distinct wildtype amino acids in the different HA subtypes. We provide an example of how rewiring the interactions among contacting residues has dramatically shifted which amino acids are tolerated at specific sites. Overall, our results show how proteins with the same structure and function can become subject to very different site-specific evolutionary constraints as their sequences diverge.",

The present study elucidates the structural determinants that result in increased mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) degradation by a feruloyl esterase, which has been engineered to resemble MHETase active site. The crystal structures of the variant in apo and benzoic acid bound state reveal the changes induced by the introduced mutation, specifically the formation of a hydrogen bond and a trans to cis isomerization of a peptide bond in the vicinity of the catalytic site. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the stabilization of the loop harboring the engineered residue, as well as an expansion of the substrate binding cleft, which would facilitate accommodation of a broader variety of substrates, indicative of a promiscuous biocatalyst.",

    "title": "Delta PSA: A New Metric for Conformational Dynamics Underlying Macrocyclic Peptide Permeability",
    "summary": "Development of oral cyclic drugs often suffers from low oral bioavailability resulting from limited passive permeability making accurate prediction a central challenge in drug development. Existing approaches generally fall into two categories: deep learning, based models and accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations. While deep learning models enable rapid, high throughput predictions, they often suffer from dependence on training data, and sensitivity to dataset biases. On the other hand, aMD provide mechanistic interpretability by explicitly modeling peptide translocation across lipid bilayers, however, suffer from huge computational cost. Here, we present a conventional MD-based framework for predicting macrocyclic peptide permeability, designed to facilitate interpretation. Importantly, we show that Delta PSA directly quantifies a peptide's chameleon propensity, providing a mechanistically meaningful measure. Furthermore, we identify two key structural indicators, the sidechain PSA ratio and the radius of gyration, as refined metrics for assessing conformational behavior. When applied to a benchmark dataset of macrocyclic peptides, our framework achieves an MSE of 0.22, surpassing the 0.25 reported for Multi_CycGT and demonstrating its superior performance. Our work also provides a large dataset of MD trajectories for macrocyclic peptides in both polar and nonpolar environments. This dataset offers access to a broader conformational space for cyclic peptide studies.",

    "title": "Circulating miR-4532 is associated with loss of ambulation in dysferlinopathy",
    "summary": "Background: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) are inherited myopathies characterized mainly by progressive weakness of the proximal muscles of the shoulder and pelvic girdle areas, leading to functional decline and eventual loss of independent ambulation. Dysferlinopathy (LGMD2B) is an autosomal recessive LGMD subtype, is caused by mutations in the DYSF gene that lead to lack of dysferlin which results in muscle death and chronic muscle fiber degeneration. Preservation of ambulation is a key clinical milestone, as loss of independent gait markedly reduces quality of life and complicates care management. Although patients often perceive functional decline before their initial clinical presentation, current clinical assessments typically detect disease progression after substantial muscle damage has occurred. Methods: In this multigroup case-control study, we profiled plasma miRNAs from 49 genetically confirmed dysferlinopathy patients (24 ambulatory, 25 non-ambulatory) and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Total RNA was extracted from blood samples and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 3.1 arrays. After quality control and filtering, differential expression analysis was performed using linear models for microarrays, adjusting for age and sex, with a false discovery rate cutoff of 10%. Results: 14 miRNAs were significantly altered between dysferlinopathy patients and controls. Notably, miR-4532 was upregulated in ambulatory patients relative to controls, whereas it was downregulated in non-ambulatory patients compared with ambulatory patients, although expression levels remained higher than in controls. Levels of miR-4532 were positively associated with circulating monocyte levels in ambulatory patients only.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have prompted claims about autonomous \"AI scientists,\" yet systematic evaluations of these capabilities remain scarce. This exploratory study investigates whether current AI frameworks can execute scientific research tasks beyond isolated demonstrations. We tested eight open-source AI frameworks (Agent Laboratory, AutoGen, BabyAGI, GPT Researcher, MOOSE-Chem2, SciAgents, SciMON, and Virtual Lab) on two tasks that aimed to reproduce research on algorithm development from recent papers in uncertainty quantification and protein interaction discovery. In our evaluation, no framework completed a full research cycle from literature understanding through computational execution to validated results and scientific paper writing. While all systems showed competence in conceptual tasks such as planning and summarization, they consistently failed at robust implementation. Every framework produced sophisticated hallucinations. Deployment proved demanding, requiring substantial debugging and technical expertise, which undermines common claims about the democratization of science with AI. Despite these limitations, the frameworks showed promise as research assistants for methodological planning and ideation under careful human supervision. Our findings suggest that the explored AI systems cannot yet autonomously conduct scientific research, but may provide real value for specific subtasks within the research workflow. We offer preliminary observations to help researchers and developers better understand the gap between advertised and actual capabilities of AI in science.",

    "summary": "Motion speed is a salient cue for visual segmentation, yet how the visual system represents and differentiates multiple speeds remains unclear. Here, we investigated the encoding and decoding of multiple speeds. We first characterized the perceptual capacity of human and macaque subjects to segment overlapping stimuli moving at different speeds. We then determined how neurons in area MT of macaque monkeys represent multiple speeds. We found that the responses of MT neurons to two speeds showed a robust bias toward the faster speed component. This faster-speed bias occurred when both speeds were slow (\u226420\u00b0/s) and diminished as stimulus speed increased. Our findings can be explained by a modified divisive normalization model, in which the weights for the speed components are proportional to the responses of a population of neurons (the weighting pool) with a broad range of speed preferences, elicited by the individual speeds. Regarding decoding, a classifier could distinguish MT responses to two speeds from those to a corresponding log-mean speed. We further found that it was possible to decode two speeds from the MT population response, supporting the theoretical framework of coding multiplicity in neuronal populations. The decoded speeds can account for perceptual performance in segmenting two speeds with a large (4x) but not a small (2x) separation. Our findings help define the neural coding rule of multiple speeds. The faster-speed bias in MT could benefit important behavioral tasks, such as figure-ground segregation, as figural objects tend to move faster than the background in the natural environment.",

    "title": "Decoding the biogenesis of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta and their fusion with nuclear speckles",
    "summary": "Viruses rely on host cellular machinery for replication. After entering the nucleus, the HIV genome accumulates in nuclear niches where it undergoes reverse transcription and integrates into neighbouring chromatin, promoting high transcription rates and new virus progeny. Despite antiretroviral treatment, viral genomes can persist in these nuclear niches and reactivate upon treatment interruption, raising the possibility that they could play a role in the establishment of viral reservoirs. The post-nuclear entry dynamics of HIV remain unclear, and understanding these steps is critical for revealing how viral reservoirs are established. In this study, we elucidate the formation of HIV-induced CPSF6 puncta and the domains of CPSF6 essential for this process. We also explore the roles of nuclear speckle (NS) scaffold factors, SON and SRRM2, in the biogenesis of these puncta. Through genetic manipulation and depletion experiments, we demonstrate the key role of the intrinsically disordered region of SRRM2 in enlarging NSs in the presence of the HIV capsid. We identify the FG domain of CPSF6 as essential for both puncta formation and binding to the viral core, which serves as the scaffold for CPSF6 puncta. While the low-complexity regions modulate CPSF6 binding to the viral capsid, they do not contribute to puncta formation, nor do the disordered mixed charge domains of CPSF6. Interestingly, the FG peptide facilitates viral replication. These results demonstrate how HIV evolved to hijack host nuclear factors, enabling its persistence in the host. Of note, this study provides new insights into the underlying interactions between host factors and viral components, advancing our understanding of HIV nuclear dynamics and offering potential therapeutic targets for preventing viral persistence.",

    "title": "De Novo Design of Zearalenone Binding Proteins: A Comparison of Tamarind Bio and CARPdock-NISE-Boltz-2 Pipelines for Biosensor Applications",
    "summary": "Zearalenone is a mycotoxin frequently found in cereals and pseudocereals, which has shown male reproductive toxicity and synergistic effects with other mycotoxins. Current detection methods for zearalenone are largely based on chromatography or antibody-based assays, and no de novo designed protein receptors are available as recognition elements for biosensors. In this work, de novo zearalenone-binding proteins have been designed using two competing computational pipelines: (i) Tamarind Bio\u2019s all-atom RFdiffusion-ProteinMPNN-RoseTTAFold workflow and (ii) a NISE-CARPdock pipeline combining scaffold generation, LaserMPNN design, and Boltz-2 folding. Three top candidates (RFdiff-ZB1, NC-ZB1, NC-ZB2) exhibited high structural confidence with global average pLDDT values between 0.97-0.98, docking analysis using GNINA produced docking scores of -5.99 to -9.70. Molecular-dynamics-based minimization yielded affinities of -10.48 to -10.92 kcal/mol with minimized pose RMSDs of 0.26-0.68 \u00c5 and CNNscores up to 0.80.

    "title": "Embedding-Based Applicability Domain for Graph Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Benchmark on Molecular Property Prediction",
    "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for molecular property prediction, but they are not magic. When applied to molecules unlike their training data, they produce unreliable predictions that are difficult to detect. The Applicability Domain (AD) concept addresses this by defining regions of chemical space where predictions should be trusted. We benchmark embedding-based AD methods across three GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, MPNN) and nine MoleculeNet datasets. Our hybrid AD score combines density estimation (KDE), distance metrics (kNN, Mahalanobis), and prediction uncertainty (entropy, margin). An automated thresh- old optimization selects cutoffs that balance accuracy gains against sample retention. Benchmark results confirm the utility of the framework. Restricting predictions to the In-Domain subset improved AUC up to 0.96 (BACE-GCN) and reduced RMSE to 0.66 (Lipo-GAT), while Out- Domain samples showed 2-3\u00d7 higher error rates. Coverage ranged from 8% (aggressive filtering) to 99% (conservative), depending on dataset difficulty. Case studies on ESOL and BBBP demonstrate that flagged molecules have interpretable structural features (long aliphatic chains, unusual ring systems, or heteroatom combinations) that correlate with prediction failures.",

In macaque V1, activity generated by nonclassical receptive field (nCRF) stimulation involves different intracortical circuitry than activity generated by CRF stimulation, suggesting that interactions between neurons across V1 layers differ under CRF and nCRF stimulus conditions. Using Neuropixels probes, we measured border ownership modulation within large, local populations of V1 neurons. We found that neurons in single columns preferred the same side of objects located outside of the CRF. In addition, we found that cross-correlations between pairs of neurons situated across feedback/horizontal and input layers differed between CRF and nCRF stimulation. Furthermore, independent of the comparison with CRF stimulation, we observed that the magnitude of border ownership modulation increased with the proportion of information flow from feedback/horizontal layers to input layers. These results demonstrate that the flow of signals between layers covaries with the degree to which neurons integrate information from beyond the CRF.",

    "title": "Bridging the Gap: Aqueous Phase Organic Synthesis as a Foundation for Advanced Chemical and Biological Discovery",
    "summary": "For over a century, synthetic chemistry demanded the rigorous exclusion of water, relying on toxic, volatile organic solvents. This paradigm, while successful, is environmentally and economically costly. This review advocates for a fundamental shift: adopting water not just as a green solvent, but as a transformative medium that reshapes our understanding of reactivity and bridges chemistry with biology. Aqueous phase organic synthesis (APOS) has evolved from accidental observations to a deliberate discipline. Water\u2019s unique properties\u2014its high polarity, hydrogen-bonding capacity, and the hydrophobic effect\u2014make it an active participant. This effect drives reactant aggregation and stabilizes transition states, leading to dramatic rate enhancements in pericyclic and condensation reactions. A broad range of reactions thrive in water, including classical carbon\u2013carbon bond-forming reactions like the aldol and Diels\u2013Alder, and modern cross-couplings (e.g., Suzuki\u2013Miyaura) enabled by water-tolerant catalysts. Multicomponent and click chemistries are particularly powerful. Challenges like poor solubility are addressed with micellar catalysis, water-soluble ligands, and precise control of the reaction microenvironment. Beyond sustainability, APOS drives discovery, often yielding improved selectivities, new pathways, and streamlined syntheses of complex targets like pharmaceuticals. Its greatest promise lies in interfacing with biology. Bioorthogonal reactions, such as azide\u2013alkyne cycloadditions, enable labeling and imaging in living organisms. Aqueous compatibility is essential for in situ therapeutic strategies, chemical biology, and advanced bioconjugation techniques for modifying biomolecules. The future converges with emerging technologies: machine learning to navigate complex aqueous systems, flow chemistry for scalability, and the integration of enzymatic with synthetic catalysis. This points toward a unified chemical-biological engineering paradigm. In conclusion, APOS is a mature, versatile field. It is a cornerstone of green chemistry and a critical bridge to biology, accelerating progress in medicine and materials science. Embracing water is both an environmental imperative and a strategic pathway to the next generation of scientific discovery.\nIntroduction: The Solvent Problem in Organic Synthesis\nFor generations, organic synthesis has been defined by precise control over molecular structure carried out in rigorously dried environments. Since the emergence of modern organic chemistry in the nineteenth century, water \u2013 the very medium that sustains life \u2013 has been regarded as an obstacle to chemical transformation. This long-standing assumption has shaped laboratory routines, industrial manufacturing, and chemical education, reinforcing the idea that successful synthesis depends on strict exclusion of moisture. This introduction revisits that historical mindset, evaluates its environmental and economic consequences, and presents the case for a fundamental transition toward aqueous phase organic synthesis (APOS) as a more suitable platform for future chemical and biological innovation.",

    "summary": "Clusteroluminescence (CL) refers to a newly emerging luminescence phenomenon observed in non-conjugated structures, particularly aliphatic polymers, which inherently exhibit good biocompatibility and processability. However, precise manipulation of CL properties, such as emission wavelength and efficiency, remains a critical challenge in this field. In this work, we propose methylation as an effective strategy to enhance inter- and intrachain through-space conjugation (TSC), thereby significantly increasing CL intensity. We preliminarily suggest that methylation disrupts hydrogen bonding, liberating the lone-pair n electrons of heteroatoms to participate in n-electron-involved TSC. We believe that methylation may evolve into a general and powerful approach for regulating the CL behavior of polymers, especially in nucleic acid systems.",

    "title": "Removing H-Bonds of Non-Aromatic Peptidomimetics for Intrinsic Near-Infrared Emission",
    "summary": "Peptides and peptidomimetics are promising in diverse biological applications, but intrinsic visible emission without appended fluorophores remains a great challenge due to the lack of \u03c0-conjugation in their non-aromatic backbones. Although clusteroluminescence (CL) of nonconjugated materials provides a pathway for intrinsic emission, most non-aromatic clusterolumigens (CLgens) are limited to blue emission, and the underlying factor hindering emission redshift remains unclear. Herein, we identified that intramolecular/intermolecular hydrogen H-bonds between heteroatoms (e.g., \u2013NH2, C=O) compete with through-space conjugation (TSC) and suppress emission redshift. To address this issue, we designed and synthesized ten peptidomimetic polyurethanes (P1-L/H\u2013P5-L) with gradient H-bond densities. Comprehensive characterizations including infrared spectroscopy, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum-chemical calculations confirmed that selective removal of H-bonds enhanced TSC. Notably, H-bond-deficient P4-L and P5-L achieved intrinsic NIR emission at 763 nm and 784 nm, respectively, which is among the longest emission wavelengths reported for non-aromatic CLgens. This work reveals the inhibitory role of H-bonds in TSC and provides a novel strategy for developing intrinsic NIR-emitting peptidomimetics, holding great potential for biological applications.",

    "title": "Importance of Nonadiabatic Effects in Modeling Absorption Spectra of Indole and Cyanoindole Derivatives in Solution",
    "summary": "Nonadiabatic effects arising from conical intersections between excited states play a crucial role in the optical properties of a wide range of chromophores and have to be accounted for in first-principles modeling of spectral lineshapes. In this work, we investigate the importance of nonadiabatic effects in the absorption spectra of indole and cyanoindole derivatives by contrasting three modeling approaches. In the Gaussian Condon and Gaussian Non-Condon Theory formalisms, the linear response function is computed from excitation energy fluctuations of independent adiabatic excited states sampled along molecular dynamics trajectories, with the latter approach additionally including transition dipole moment fluctuations to account for Herzberg- Teller-type effects. In contrast, the tensor network-based T-TEDOPA approach allows for numerically exact quantum dynamics simulations of explicitly coupled diabatic excited states. We find that only the explicit coupling of the two lowest-lying excited states, La and Lb, within the T-TEDOPA approach yields accurate absorption spectra for all systems, while an adiabatic treatment underestimates spectral contributions from excitations into states with highly mixed electronic character. We further elucidate the role of polar solvent stabilization of the charge-transfer character La state by comparing indole in vacuum and in water, showing that solvent effects significantly shape the ultrafast population transfer between excited states and contribute to the differences in the experimental absorption lineshapes. Finally, we discuss the influence of cyano substituent position on the optical properties of cyanoindole derivatives through changes in the energy ordering of La and Lb, their relative transition dipole moments, and stabilization of the charge-transfer state in polar solvent.",

    "summary": "Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are dynamic and critical to adaptive homeostasis. While there have been massive efforts to catalogue proteome-wide PPIs, global quantification of changes remains a challenge. Here, we integrate dynamic protein correlation profiling - mass spectrometry (PCP-MS) and quantitative cross linking-mass spectrometry (qXL-MS) using multiplexed stable isotope labelling to characterise global PPI remodelling following the development of chronic skeletal muscle insulin resistance (IR) with or without acute insulin stimulation. We quantify >7,000 unique PPIs amongst 5,346 proteins and show changes in the interactome network dominate the proteome response. Our data show the dysregulation of protein processing in the endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum involving changes in PPIs with protein chaperones and disulfide isomerases is a major hallmark of skeletal muscle IR. Mechanistically, we show the dysregulation of PPIs with Protein-Disulfide Isomerase 6 (PDIA6) regulates cysteine oxidation and insulin sensitivity. Taken together, we show in vivo quantitative interactome mapping is a powerful approach to understand disease mechanisms and provide new insights into protein network re-organisations with IR.",

    "title": "Conformation Driven Enhancement of Neurolysin Activity in Presence of a Small Molecule Activator",
    "summary": "Neurolysin (Nln) is an M3 metallopeptidase that regulates neuropeptide concentration in the central nervous system. It has emerged as a therapeutic target for mitigating post-ischemic injury by hydrolyzing and inactivating several neuropeptides. It has been recently shown that small molecule activators, such as pyridine piperazine (Py-Pip) derivatives, can enhance Nln catalytic activity, facilitating hydrolysis of Nln substrate peptides. However, binding sites of these molecules and the mechanism of action remain unclear due to the dynamic nature of Nln. Here, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the apo and activator-bound Nln systems along with Markov state modeling to identify three binding sites of Py-Pip, and quantify their effects on the Nln conformational landscape and kinetics. Two of these sites have opposing functional outcomes: Binding inside the interhelical channel favors closed conformations by slowing down channel opening, thus allowing the substrates to orient favorably for the catalytic reaction, while binding at the exterior region of the channel stabilizes open states, potentially facilitating both substrate entry and cleaved product release. These findings suggest a possibility of a multi-site allosteric activation model in which distinct binding locations selectively modulate different steps within a catalytic cycle. This framework provides a structural and kinetic model for the action of small molecule Nln activators, offering insight into the design of cerebro-protective therapeutics that reduce neuropeptide accumulation after ischemic injury.",

    "summary": "Microhylid frogs are a hyper-diverse family thought to have radiated explosively around the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. Roughly half of microhylid species richness is concentrated into a single subfamily, the Asterophryinae, which is centered in New Guinea and surrounds, and has been a rich source for species discovery over the past 50 years. However, resolving Asteroprhyinae phylogenetics has remained a challenge, with frequent taxonomic reshuffling. To address this instability, we generated a sequence-capture molecular dataset to investigate the phylogenetics of the group. This included 71 species of Asteroprhyinae, across 13 of 17 recognized genera representing extensive sampling of the New Guinea radiation and full sampling of Australian microhylid species. Our dated species tree supports an explosive diversification of microhylids in New Guinea near the start of the Miocene, approximately 20 million years ago. Asterophryinae expansion into northern Australia occurred much later (~10 ma) and is marked by well supported clades of Austrochaperina and Cophixalus that show temporally consistent splits from their New Guinea ancestors. Our phylogeny allows us to identify several instances of polyphyly which are at odds with our current understanding of intergeneric relationships within the Asterophryinae. We suggest this confusion is a result of rapid radiation and morphological variability across some poorly defined genera. This work establishes a reliable phylogenetic framework that can form a foundation for a more stable taxonomy of the Asterophryinae.",

    "title": "Centimeter-Scale Giant-Grain Growth: Radial Expansion of MAPbI3-xClx Precursor Single Crystals from a Single Nucleus on Glass",
    "summary": "Here I report a novel crystal growth phenomenon termed \u201cradial Giant-Grain Growth\u201d (r-GGG), which transforms spin-coated polycrystalline MAPbI3\u2212xClx thin films into macroscopic single-nucleus domains spanning millimeters to centimeters. Although governed solely by substrate temperature and ambient humidity, r-GGG is characterized by the extreme suppression of secondary nucleation, allowing a single nucleus\u2014either a hydrate or a perovskite phase\u2014to dominate growth over extensive areas. Specifically, a Cl-rich seed layer is prepared by spin-coating a precursor solution (MAI:PbCl2 = 3:1 molar ratio in DMF), followed by brief annealing at 60\u00b0C under an inert atmosphere. Subsequent exposure to air (65\u201370% relative humidity) initiates r-GGG. At room temperature, densely packed, needle-like hydrate single crystals propagate radially from a single nucleus at an isotropic growth rate, resulting in films composed of needle-crystal aggregates with millimeter- to centimeter-scale domains\u2014a morphology unprecedented in conventional perovskite fabrication. Conversely, substrate temperatures exceeding 50\u00b0C induce the direct lateral growth of large-grain MAPbI3\u2212xClx. Notably, thermal annealing of the r-GGG-derived hydrate films at 90\u00b0C yields highly textured MAPbI3\u2212xClx films with pronounced (110) preferred orientation (strong (110) texture), as evidenced by the dominance of the (110)/(220) reflections and a narrowed rocking-curve width relative to conventional thin films. These (110)-textured films exhibit exceptional stability, showing negligible degradation even after one week of ambient exposure. These findings challenge the long-standing dogma that moisture must be strictly excluded during perovskite fabrication, demonstrating instead that controlled humidity can serve as a potent driving force for forming macroscopically coherent crystal domains. Elucidating the physical mechanisms underlying r-GGG could enable the fabrication of giant-grain thin films with long-range, periodically spaced nucleation sites across diverse material systems, offering a new conceptual framework for crystal growth science.",

    "summary": "Ensuring sufficient vaccine supply to resource-constrained settings is a paramount global health priority. As climate change threatens disruption of global supply chains, vaccine manufacturers have a duty to evaluate their own supply chains and production facilities to understand how they can engage in more environmentally sustainable manufacturing. However, few publicly available environmental impact models have been developed for vaccine production. Discussed here is a novel model developed to capture environmental impact of quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine manufacturing from upstream material inputs for fermentation, cell processing, and clarification, through filling and packaging. Findings include a calculated carbon footprint of 1.20 kg CO2 eq per dose of packaged vaccine. Energy demand for fermentation steps accounted for 60% of total system emissions. Fermentation energy demand was 60\u201365% of model impact for ozone depletion and human toxicity. Emissions heavily depend on grid geography and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; an Indian production facility would generate 130% greater emissions than one using a European energy mix. Regardless of location, manufacturers can take important steps to reduce emissions, such as strategies focused on process intensification and continuous batch manufacturing. Often, these improvements offer economic gains, which in turn incentivize development of more sustainable production practices.",

    "summary": "Fe\u2084S\u2084 clusters play essential roles in nature, classically in electron transport but increasingly in newly discovered reactivity or catalysis. These roles have spurred interest in developing synthetic Fe4S4 systems and while several molecular and material systems based on Fe\u2084S\u2084 clusters have been developed, comparatively few examples of synthetic Fe\u2084S\u2084 cluster-based catalysts exist. Herein, we present the use of an Fe\u2084S\u2084-based coordination polymer as a catalyst for the direct and selective electroreduction of CO2 to CO. Computational studies suggest that the reaction proceeds through CO2 binding to a reduced Fe4S4 cluster, followed by a series of protonation, reduction, and H2O loss steps to yield a CO-bound cluster that can finally exchange with CO2 to restart the catalytic cycle. CO bound clusters are predicted to be thermodynamically stable, suggesting that carbonyl species might be off-cycle intermediates. Mechanistic CV studies as well as in situ studies by IR spectroscopy provide evidence for carbonyl-ligated clusters, supporting these compounds as unusual examples of small molecule binding to Fe4S4 clusters. This work establishes Fe4S4 cluster-based coordination polymers as direct electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction and provides mechanistic insights into how these clusters mediate catalytic conversions of small molecules.",

    "summary": "<p>by Christopher N. Davis, Edward M. Hill, Chris P. Jewell, Kristyna Rysava, Robin N. Thompson, Michael J. Tildesley</p>\n\nSince 2020, large-scale outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in Great Britain have resulted in substantial poultry mortality and economic losses. Alongside the costs, the risk of circulation leading to a viral reassortment that causes zoonotic spillover raises additional concerns. However, the precise mechanisms driving transmission between poultry premises and the impact of potential control measures in Great Britain, such as vaccination, are not fully understood. We have developed a spatial transmission model for the spread of HPAI in poultry premises calibrated to infected premises data for the 2022\u201323 season using Markov chain Monte Carlo. Our results indicate that reducing the susceptibility of the premises surrounding an identified infected premises (for example, through enhanced biosecurity measures and/or vaccination) can substantially reduce the overall number of infected premises. Our findings highlight that enhanced control measures could limit the future impact of HPAI on the poultry industry and reduce the risk of broader health threats.",

We also demonstrate its application to the analysis of cell morphology changes during cell migration. Cell migration is essential for many physiological and pathological processes. Intracellular force generation and transmission of these forces to extracellular structures or neighbouring cells drives cell migration. The emergent property of the processes driving cell migration is a change in cell shape. We describe a machine learning approach to understand the relationship of cell shape dynamics and cell migration behaviour. Our algorithm analyses cell shape from time-lapse images and learns the intrinsic low-dimensional structure of cell shape space. We use the resultant shape space map to visualise differences in cell shape distribution following perturbation experiments and to analyse the quantitative relationships between shape and migration behaviour. The core of our algorithm is a new, rapid, and landmark-free shape difference measure that allows unbiased analysis of the widely varying morphologies exhibited by migrating mesenchymal cells. We used our method to predict cell turning from dynamic cell shape information. ShapeSpaceExplorer can be applied widely to visualise and analyse cell morphology changes during development, the cell cycle and stress response, but also to the outlines of clusters, tissues and inanimate objects.",

    "summary": "<p>by Tracy S\u00e1nchez Pacheco, Debora Nolte, Sabine U. K\u00f6nig, Gordon Pipa, Peter K\u00f6nig</p>\n\nSpatial learning emerges not only from static environmental cues but also from the social and semantic context embedded in our surroundings. This study investigates how human agents influence visual exploration and spatial knowledge acquisition in a controlled Virtual Reality (VR) environment, focusing on the role of contextual congruency. Participants freely explored a 1 km<sup>2</sup> virtual city while their eye movements were recorded. Agents were visually identical across conditions but placed in locations that were either congruent, incongruent, or neutral with respect to the surrounding environment. Using Bayesian hierarchical modeling, we found that incongruent agents elicited longer fixations and higher gaze transition entropy (GTE), a measure of scanning variability. Crucially, GTE emerged as the strongest predictor of spatial recall accuracy. A counterfactual mediation analysis indicated a small but reliable pathway via GTE and, for incongruent agents, a larger direct component not captured by GTE. These findings suggest that human-contextual incongruence promotes more flexible and distributed visual exploration, thereby enhancing spatial learning. By showing that human agents shape not only where we look but how we explore and encode space, this study contributes to a growing understanding of how social meaning guides attention and supports navigation.",

    "title": "Intermittent AP-1 activation in muscles contributes to exercise-induced health benefits",
    "summary": "Regular physical exercise extends healthspan, yet the molecular mechanisms that translate intermittent contractile stress into lasting benefit remain incompletely understood. Using global nuclear run-on (GRO-seq) in mouse skeletal muscle after treadmill running, we profiled enhancer RNA (eRNA), a sensitive marker of enhancer activity. Activation protein-1 (AP-1), a family of pioneering factors for senescence, emerged as the top transcription factor with motif enrichment in exercise-activated enhancers. Our screen in the contracting C2C12 myotubes pinpointed cFos/JunD as the primary AP-1 factor responsible for contraction-induced transcriptional changes. Muscle-specific overexpression of A-Fos, a dominant-negative mutant of cFos, disrupted transcriptomic responses to exercise and attenuated exercise-mediated improvement in muscle functions. Interestingly, intermittent but not continuous overexpression of cFos/JunD in mouse muscles mimicked exercise-induced transcriptomic changes, increased mitochondrial volume density, enhanced muscle strength and fatigue resistance, and improved glucose tolerance. These results define a transcriptional regulatory signaling pathway linking exercise intermittency to beneficial adaptations and highlight the necessary recovery cycles in training. The paradoxical anti- and pro-aging roles of AP-1 offer insights into the timing and dynamics of stressors and stress responses in shaping senescence and healthspan.",

    "summary": "We report high figure-of-merit optical leaf sensors based on dielectric metasurfaces and stimuli-responsive polymers. The metasurfaces have narrowband resonances and are broadly transparent across the visible spectrum to allow photosynthesis for unobstructive monitoring of crop health. These sensors are fabricated at scale using direct nanoimprint lithography into UV curable-TiO2 nanocrystal (NC) inks to structure optical metasurfaces, followed by a room-temperature ligand exchange process to create a nanoporous TiO2 scaffold. The nanoporous TiO2 metasurfaces are then infiltrated by a stimuli-responsive polymer while retaining their geometry and optical quality. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate optical humidity sensors by incorporating the moisture-responsive chitosan biopolymer into the nanoporous TiO2 metasurfaces, resulting in a 430 % improvement in sensitivity compared to conventional RI sensors where the polymer surrounds the metasurface. The sensors are mounted on leaves and the highly reflective resonances, which are readily distinguishable from the leaf background, respond dynamically to leaf water stress, enabling passive, battery-free monitoring of leaf surface humidity.",

    "summary": "Neuronal function requires precise long-distance axonal transport mediated by molecular motors and RNA-binding proteins like SFPQ, though regulatory mechanisms remain poorly defined. We identify long non-coding RNA NORAD as a master regulator of this process through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). While SFPQ and kinesin-1 mediate cargo delivery, the specific RNA coordinating their interaction was unknown. We demonstrate NORAD directly binds kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1) and promotes SFPQ condensation into dynamic LLPS droplets, enabling efficient transport. CRISPR-assisted mapping and functional assays show NORAD depletion disrupts granule dynamics, impairs neuroprotective mRNA localization, and induces axonal degeneration. In vitro reconstitution confirms NORAD-KLC1 synergy enhances SFPQ phase separation, and neuron-specific knockout mice exhibit motor deficits with reduced neuronal density. These findings establish the first evidence of lncRNA NORAD-mediated LLPS in axonal transport, revealing a new paradigm for RNA-guided neuronal maintenance.",

    "title": "Fate of organic contaminants in electrochemical nitrogen recovery from urine",
    "summary": "This study compared the fate of pharmaceuticals and disinfection byproducts across three electrochemical nitrogen recovery processes treating urine: electrochemical stripping (ECS), electrodialysis (ED), and bipolar electrodialysis (BPED). ECS achieved greater TAN recovery efficiencies than ED and BPED and was the only process that recovered a urine-derived  ammonium sulfate product rather than a mixed concentrate (containing TAN, sodium, and potassium). Enrichment and removal ratios based on target pharmaceutical quantification and suspect screening were used to evaluate the fate of organic compounds relative to nitrogen recovery. These metrics suggested that ECS prevented organic contamination of the product more effectively than the other two processes and that both ECS and BPED achieved greater organic removal than ED. No disinfection byproducts were detected in the product for any process, but formation in other chambers may require mitigation. Our findings inform pre- and post-treatment for electrochemical nitrogen recovery, as well as modifications to reactor configuration and operating conditions. With future work using suspect screening and identification of additional compounds to build greater mechanistic understanding of compound fate and characterize the toxicity of contaminants detected in treated urine and recovered products, our work will advance electrochemical technologies that recover high-purity, safely applied products and enable a circular nitrogen economy.",

    "title": "Lipid Molecular Geometry, Phase Behaviour, and Nucleation Kinetics in Cholesterol Gallstone Formation:\nToward an Integrated Physicochemical Framework",
    "summary": "ABSTRACT\nCholesterol gallstone formation requires supersaturation of bile with cholesterol, commonly quantified by the cholesterol saturation index (CSI). While supersaturation of bile with cholesterol is a necessary prerequisite for cholesterol precipitation, bile samples with comparable cholesterol saturation index (CSI) values can exhibit markedly different crystallization behaviours. This inconsistency indicates that the cholesterol saturation index alone cannot predict crystallization pathways or nucleation kinetics.\nHere, we synthesize experimental findings from native and model bile systems to propose an integrated physicochemical framework for interpreting cholesterol gallstone formation. Evidence from the literature indicates that lipid molecular geometry\u2014associated with phospholipid acyl-chain composition and bile acid structure\u2014is associated with differences in how cholesterol is accommodated within lipid aggregates. These molecular-scale properties are expressed at the mesoscale through distinct phase behaviours, including micellar, vesicular, and liquid-crystalline states, which are associated with different, reproducible cholesterol crystallization pathways described in bile systems.\nExperimental observations further indicate that nucleation kinetics plays a decisive role in shaping crystallization outcome. Even within similar phase regimes, differences in vesicle stability, aggregation dynamics, and interfacial organization are associated with substantial variability in nucleation behaviour, including delayed or absent crystal formation despite thermodynamically permissive conditions. Within this framework, the established cholesterol crystallization pathways can be interpreted as alternative trajectories that emerge from differences in lipid organization and kinetic accessibility under comparable degrees of supersaturation.\nBy explicitly integrating lipid molecular geometry, phase behaviour, and nucleation kinetics, this synthesis provides a coherent physicochemical context for interpreting variability in cholesterol crystallization behaviour and situates cholesterol supersaturation within a broader, experimentally grounded framework for understanding cholesterol gallstone formation.",

    "summary": "Plant viruses typically rely on insect vectors for transmission between plants, with insect salivary proteins playing critical roles in this process. In this study, we demonstrate how <i>Laodelphax striatellus</i> salivary carbonic anhydrase (LssaCA) promotes rice stripe virus (RSV) infection in plants. We discovered that LssaCA directly binds to RSV nucleocapsid protein (NP) in insect salivary glands. This LssaCA-NP complex interacts with a rice thaumatin-like protein (OsTLP) that possesses endo-\u03b2-1,3-glucanase activity potentially degrading callose. Upon binding, the LssaCA-NP complex significantly enhances OsTLP enzymatic activity. We further clarify that both <i>L. striatellus</i> feeding and RSV infection induce callose deposition. The tripartite LssaCA-NP-OsTLP interaction enhances callose degradation, thereby facilitating RSV infection via its insect vector. This study provides new insights into complex virus-insect-plant tripartite interactions mediated by insect salivary proteins, with broad implications for numerous plant viruses transmitted by insect vectors.",

    "summary": "Segregated network composites achieve electrical percolation at minimal filler loadings by localizing conductivity to architectural boundaries. However, achieving this architecture typically requires tedious multi-step processing, often incompatible with scalable manufacturing. Here, we report the single-step synthesis of a silicone composite segregated network composed of self-assembled percolating graphene networks. These networks are templated by graphene-stabilized water-in-oil emulsions, created by spontaneous exfoliation of graphite at oil/water interfaces generated by agitation. After polymerization of the silicone and removal of the dispersed aqueous phase, the resulting foams achieve conductivities of 0.43 S/m at a 1.37 vol% loading of graphene. This is a 12-fold reduction compared to prior interfacial assembly methods, which require 16.5 vol% loading and thousands of hours of processing to achieve comparable electrical conductivity. Architectural segregation decouples mechanical and electrical properties, enabling application-specific modulus tuning. The foams exhibit reversible piezoresistance with a U-shaped strain response, are stable through 5000 cycles, and provide voltage-controlled heating to 143 \u00b0C at milliamp current densities, three orders of magnitude lower than those of continuous CVD graphene networks. The low thermal mass of the air-filled foam structure provides rapid thermal response, achieving 28-second de-icing from -17 \u00b0C.",

Despite the complexity of knowledge and information, our conceptual and empirical grasp of its evolution lags significantly behind. Progress in disciplines such as artificial intelligence, genomics, cognitive science, cyber governance, global ecology, and quantum mechanics depends critically on a more rigorous understanding of information dynamics. Absent such insight, humanity risks succumbing to entropic forces that threaten systemic stability and long-term survival.</p>\n<p>In this book, Klaus Jaffe addresses the limitations of prior treatments of infodynamics, many of which have been incomplete, imprecise, or conceptually flawed. It offers an interdisciplinary investigation into the relationship between information and energy, drawing on theoretical and empirical contributions from economics, biology, and physics. By challenging conventional paradigms, the book constructs a conceptual framework that bridges disparate scientific domains and societal processes. The resulting synthesis opens new avenues for empirical inquiry and policy-relevant research, with implications for both academic scholarship and public discourse.</p>\n<p>Inviting readers to explore the evolving frontier of information science, the book highlights the role of information and its impact on both natural and social systems.</p>\n<p>More at: <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-88842-7\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">link.springer.com</a></p>",

    "summary": "Our study focuses on an experimental demonstration of a novel method for CO2 removal from ocean water that combines H2 and redox salt looping to induce pH swings\nin electrochemical flow cells. Model-driven design optimization guides 3-D printed electrolyte flow channel designs to alleviate mass-transfer limitations. A ridged flow\nchannel with 1 mm thick fins protruding at an angle of 30\u25e6 from the base reduces ferri-/ferro-cyanide redox salt diffusion boundary layer thickness by up to 41% while\nrestricting pressure drop to less than 138 Pa. A notable feature of this work is the experimental validation of the intrinsic in-situ cleaning capabilities enabled by the\nreversible looping process, eliminating what would otherwise be process down time. Over 4 acidification/basification cycles, 86% removal of fouling from electrode surfaces is demonstrated, while distinctly maintaining a constant electrochemical energy intensity.\nThe lab-scale, proof-of-concept experimental demonstration show promising results, which are interpreted to provide insights and guidelines towards further enhancing\nscalability and efficiency of oceanic carbon removal and utilization processes.",

    "title": "Probing Molecular Organization in Polar Nematic Phases: A Combined FTIR Spectroscopy and Molecular Simulation Approach",
    "summary": "The emergence of polar nematic phases, such as the ferroelectric (N F ) and antiferroelectric (N X ) phases, has opened new frontiers in soft matter science. However,\nthe relationship between molecular structure, intermolecular interactions, and the resulting\nmacroscopic order remains poorly understood. This work investigates the molecular organization in the polar nematic phases of the nJK (n=1-5) homologous series using\na combined approach of polarized Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, and Atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations. A central finding is the inadequacy of single-molecule DFT models to describe the system. While DFT accurately predicts vibrational band positions, it fails to replicate their experimental intensities, suggesting that intermolecular interactions are dominant. This is further corroborated by the anomalous temperature dependence of the average absorbance for parallel and perpendicular vibrations, which deviates significantly from simple density effects. Atomistic MD simulations of a multi-molecule system provide insight into this behavior, revealing the formation of locally ordered nanodomains driven by strong short- range correlations. Experimentally, we quantified the primary nematic order parameter (S), which follows a typical progression in the N phase but shows anomalous changes at the N-N X and N X -N F transitions, ultimately saturating at a high value of S \u2248 0.7 in the ferroelectric state. The difference between orthogonal absorbance components for perpendicular vibrations reveals a significant biaxiality order parameter (C) that increases upon cooling and exceeds 1 in the N F phase. This study demonstrates that the unique properties of polar nematics are governed by specific molecular self-assembly and establishes phase biaxiality as a key feature\nof these systems.",

    "summary": "Doping a luminescent tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl diradical m(TTM)2 into a host crystal of its diamagnetic precursor m(HTTM)2 creates a molecular color center with enhanced optical-spin interface properties important for quantum sensing. Optical polarization of the |T0\u27e9 sublevel of the diradical triplet ground state is achieved by spin-selective intersystem crossing from the |T+\u27e9 and |T-\u27e9sublevels of the triplet excited state at ambient and cryogenic temperatures. Coherent spin control of m(TTM)2 doped into m(HTTM)2 using pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy results in a ten-fold improvement in ODMR contrast over that observed for randomly ordered m(TTM)2 using continuous-wave ODMR The diradical doped crystals achieve spin coherence times of 2.8, 3.4, and 7.4 s at 294 K, 85 K, and 5 K, respectively. The diradical photoluminescence is sensitive to weak applied magnetic fields independent of temperature, excitation wavelength and dopant concentration, providing a promising pathway towards robust quantum sensing of anisotropic magnetic fields under ambient conditions.",

    "summary": "Dynamic covalent chemistry (DCvC) has revolutionized the design of crystalline materials, particularly reticulate structures such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), by enabling error-correcting assembly processes. COFs, with their structural precision and functional diversity, represent an emerging class of porous, crystalline materials with diverse applications. Herein, we report the synthesis of a novel family of crystalline, imine-linked COFs derived from a pyridine-based aldehyde scaffold. By employing aniline as a reversible modulator, precise control over the framework formation kinetics could be achieved through reversible imine exchange, thus facilitating optimal error correction and crystal growth. This strategy yielded three isoreticular COFs with distinctive crystallinity, tunable pore architectures, and high surface areas (up to 2829\u00a0m\u00b2/g). These frameworks also exhibited remarkable thermal stability (up to 485\u00a0\u00b0C) due to the synergistic effects of the rigid pyridine core and the resonance-stabilized imine linkages. These pyridine-based COFs, featuring nitrogen-rich structures and intrinsic coordination versatility, provide a unique platform for advanced functionalities driven by the pyridine-rich environment throughout the frameworks. By leveraging an underexplored aldehyde-functionalized pyridine building block, this work advances the design scope of COFs beyond traditional benzene-centered COFs. The high crystallinity, remarkable surface areas, thermal stability, and coordinating pyridine sites make these COFs well-suited for environmental remediation, gas capture, and energy applications.",

    "title": "Heterogeneity of genetic sequence within quasi-species of influenza virus revealed by single-molecule sequencing",
    "summary": "Influenza viruses exhibit high mutation rates and extensive genetic diversity, which hinder effective vaccine development and facilitate immune evasion (Taubenberger and Morens, 2006; Barr et al., 2010). These mutations arise from the error-prone viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, generating highly heterogeneous viral populations within individual hosts that conform to the quasi-species model of a cloud of related genomes evolving under selection (Domingo et al., 2012). Accurate characterization of this intra-host diversity is crucial for understanding viral evolution and improving vaccine design, yet conventional RNA sequencing often fails to detect low-frequency variants because of technical errors during sample preparation and sequencing. Here, we implement a single unique molecular identifier strategy that reduces sequencing artifacts and achieves an error rate of ~10\u207b\u2075, enabling single-particle\u2013level quantification of quasi-species diversity. Mutation frequencies greatly exceeding background error confirm their biological origin, while information-theoretic metrics such as Shannon entropy and Jensen\u2013Shannon divergence reveal non-random mutation distributions under selective constraints. This framework supports detailed studies of intra-host viral evolution and may inform artificial intelligence-driven prediction of mutational trajectories and more effective influenza vaccine strategies.",

    "summary": "Functional coatings based on amphiphilic polymer co-networks (ACNs) offer a versatile alternative to hydrogel coatings in biomedical research, providing enhanced mechanical stability and a broad range of tunable properties. This study systematically explores ACN thin films composed of star-shaped poly(\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) with varying PEG content to identify coatings with optimized amphiphilic balance for cell adhesion. Films with low PEG content (9 and 15 wt-%) promote significant protein adsorption and cell attachment, whereas PEG-rich films (38 and 47 wt-%) exhibit negligible protein adsorption and effectively inhibit cell adhesion. An ultrathin decellularized and digested extracellular matrix (dECM) coating was used to restore cell adhesiveness on PEG-rich ACN films while preserving their intrinsic material characteristics. Fibroblast studies showed that stiffness and surface roughness modulate cellular metabolic activity but do not affect initial adhesion. Time-dependent cell numbers on the samples reached levels comparable to or exceeding those on tissue culture polystyrene controls. Drug-proxy uptake depended strongly on network composition, with the highest uptake of Lucifer Yellow in PCL10_PEG10 films (~180 ng cm-2) and markedly higher uptake of Nile Red (~10 \u00b5g cm-2). These findings demonstrate the potential of ACNs as versatile functional materials for biointerface engineering in the biomedical field.",

Substituents with different electronic and steric properties, such as methyl groups, halogens, and complex aromatic rings, were introduced. A series of derivatives was designed through molecular docking-based virtual screening. Twenty-five target compounds (CAA-1 to CAA-25) were synthesized organically. Their inhibitory activity against two melanoma cell lines (A375 and C918) was tested using cytotoxicity assays (CCK-8 method), along with drug-like property predictions via the Swiss ADME online platform. Results show that CAA-23 has optimal anti-melanoma activity, providing vital experimental evidence for developing new ENO1-targeted anti-melanoma drugs, with plans to further explore its mechanisms of action in vivo and in vitro.",

We report a conceptually distinct approach in which chiral HAT catalysts are generated in situ through non-covalent self-assembly of privileged chiral phosphoric acids and commercial 2-mercaptopyridines. The phosphoric acid serves as a modular chiral source that renders the achiral thiol effectively chiral, enabling a previously inaccessible combinatorial space of chiral HAT catalysts. This platform enabled the photochemical deracemization of 2-aryl pyrrolidines, a prevalent scaffold in active pharmaceutical ingredients. Optical enrichment proceeds via enantioselective hydrogen atom relay, in which a single chiral assembly orchestrates both hydrogen atom abstraction and delivery. This concept of relaying chiral information via non-covalent assembly holds broad potential for asymmetric radical catalysis.",

This catalytic platform allows us to develop a suite of transformations that depart from current conventional synthetic logic for which alkyl C\u2013X scaffolds are confined to single-site substitutions, now transforming them into nonintuitive precursors for building vicinal complexity. Incorporation of the spin-center shift process in the platform ultimately allows for transfer of electrophilic reactivity from one carbon to another, allowing for the establishment of a new synthetic concept \u2013 \u2018electrophilic shuttling.\u2019",

    "summary": "London dispersion forces between alkyl groups can give rise to \u201csteric attraction\u201d\u2014a promising design principle in organic chemistry. The scope and magnitude of this attraction are subject to intense debate, however, with few examples known where dispersion is able to outweigh competing effects. Here we describe a system of four tetrahedral M4L(R)4 cages (M=Fe(II) or Zn(II), R=Me or Et), each confining twelve R groups within the cavity. These cages clearly demonstrate how steric attraction can dictate cage stereochemistry and stability\u2014both in solution and in the gas phase\u2014predominating over criteria of steric hinderance, strain, solvophobic effects, and metal-ligand bond strength. Instead, the observed trends align with the optimization of London dispersion between the confined alkyl groups, at the expense of other driving forces. These differences in stability manifested during the self-sorting of a mixture containing two metals and two ligands into cages that feature optimal alkyl alkyl contacts, despite the entropic preference for a statistical mixture. This work thus establishes metal-organic cages as a promising platform to study London dispersion forces.",

    "summary": "Ferritin protein nanocages store iron across nearly all living organisms.  In mammals, two subtypes of ferritin exist: heavy (H) chain and light (L) chain.  They have very similar 3D structures, but each performs a slightly different role in iron mineral formation.  How sequence differences between the two subtypes affect mineral formation within the nanocages is still unclear.  Single-particle reconstruction of cryo-TEM images was used to build models of unmineralized and partially mineralized human L-chain and H-chain ferritin, which showed that subtle differences in protein structure led to changes in the location of mineral formation within ferritin.  Explicit-solvent atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to explore how sequence-dependent electrostatics modulate ion transport, cluster formation, and mineral nucleation within the confined environment of human L- and H-chain apoferritin nanocages. Employing NaCl as a computational probe, we show that the internal charge distribution governs ion selectivity and nucleation pathways.  Analysis of liquid and solid ionic clusters, combined with Markov State Models (MSMs), reveals that mineralization proceeds through a two-step mechanism involving dense liquid-like precursors that crystallize homogeneously within the cavity.  These findings provide molecular insight into how ferritin sequence variability tunes confinement-driven nucleation and suggest general principles for designing biomimetic nanoreactors.",

    "summary": "In this work, we elucidate the origin of the unique luminescence of a square-planar 3d nickel(II) complex, [Ni(L\u2212CH3)], and explain its quenching in the differently substituted [Ni(L\u2212CF3)] through a combination of high-level multiconfigurational wave function methods and transient absorption spectroscopy. The strong agreement between computed activation barriers and experimental kinetic data validates the predicted deactivation mechanisms. In addition, the new theoretical results prompted a re-evaluation of experimental UV\u2013vis absorption spectra published earlier by some of us. The updated analysis reveals a previously overlooked, concentration-dependent oligomerization of [Ni(L\u2212CH3)], which accounts for the complexity of the visible absorption envelope. We uncover a delicate energetic balance between competing relaxation pathways that renders non-radiative deactivating electronic states inaccessible for the \u2212CH3 complex, yet accessible in its \u2212CF3 analog. In addition to common metal-centered triplet and singlet states, we have identified a class of excited states that are crucial for the differing photoactivity of the two species. These states arise from antiferromagnetic coupling of two local triplet states, metal and ligand, into an overall singlet. They are (a) not described by conventional TD-DFT approaches, due to their inherently multiconfigurational character, and (b) not widely recognized within the inorganic photochemistry community.",

The scope and magnitude of this attraction are subject to intense debate, however, with few examples known where dispersion is able to outweigh competing effects.

These cages clearly demonstrate how steric attraction can dictate cage stereochemistry and stability\u2014both in solution and in the gas phase\u2014predominating over criteria of steric hinderance, strain, solvophobic effects, and metal-ligand bond strength. Instead, the observed trends align with the optimization of London dispersion between the confined alkyl groups, at the expense of other driving forces. These differences in stability manifested during the self-sorting of a mixture containing two metals and two ligands into cages that feature optimal alkyl alkyl contacts, despite the entropic preference for a statistical mixture. This work thus establishes metal-organic cages as a promising platform to study London dispersion forces.",

Here, constant-potential molecular dynamics simulations are employed to examine anion-specific effects in potassium-ion supercapacitors using graphene electrodes and propylene carbonate-based organic electrolytes. By fixing the cation (K\u207a) and solvent while varying the anion (TFSI\u207b, PF6\u207b, and ClO4\u207b), we isolate the impact of anion geometry and ion-pairing behavior on electric double-layer formation. The results reveal pronounced anion-dependent differences in ion adsorption, interfacial structure, and capacitive response. The KTFSI electrolyte exhibits the highest integral capacitance, arising from enhanced accumulation of K\u207a ions at the electrode surface due to weakened ion-pair correlations. In contrast, PF6\u207b and ClO4\u207b form stronger ion pairs with K\u207a, limiting cation availability and reducing capacitance. These findings demonstrate charge storage can be optimized by tunning the geometry and chemical form of anions in K-ion storage systems",

Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were combined to correlate grain orientation and surface morphology changes with experimental conditions that drive shape formation. Furthermore, we performed a comprehensive voltammetric analysis across a broad range of stepped single-crystal electrodes, demonstrating that blank cyclic voltammograms in NaCl effectively decouple terrace and step contributions on copper. Our results revealed that while chloride tends to form structures comprising (100) terraces and (111) or (110) defects when oxidation-reduction pulses are applied to refacet copper, the deposition rate, determined by the ER, controls the length of the created (100) terraces and defect density. The oxidation and reduction of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) were investigated as model structure-sensitive reactions to probe how variations in the terrace-to-defect ratio affect catalytic behavior. Low-coordinated sites promote oxidation of HMF, whereas (100) terraces adjacent to steps lower the onset potential for HMF reduction. By identifying the active surface facets, this work demonstrates that surface structure engineering is a powerful approach to advance electrocatalysis on copper.",

In this paper, we systematically train and evaluate a range of machine learning models for predicting the Henry coefficients for CO2 and CH4 gas adsorption in COF materials. To account for COF structural variability, we train our models on datasets that include both chemically functionalized frameworks and interlayer displaced stacking configurations. By comparing predictive performance across descriptor\u2013model architecture combinations, we demonstrate how different models capture the key physical factors governing gas adsorption, including electrostatics, local atomic environments, and van der Waals interactions.

Dust traps formed at sharp viscosity transitions $-$ such as at the edges of the accretionally inactive dead zones $-$ can halt radial drift and enhance dust coagulation. In this study, dust dynamics is investigated using \\texttt{RAPID}, a one-dimensional Lagrangian-Eulerian simulation code that tracks representative particle trajectories over time. In order to explore the effect of physical parameters on dust evolution, a grid of 243 models was run. The simulation grid covers a range of parameters such as viscosity, width of the transition region at the edges of the dead zone, disk surface density exponent, and the collisional fragmentation velocity of the dust particles. The computational domain extends from 1 to 50 AU and covers $5\\times10^5$ years of disk evolution, assuming a disk mass of $\\sim 0.005\\,M_\\odot$. The results show that pressure maxima can trap up to $3-10\\,M_\\oplus$ of dust, depending on the local disk conditions. However, increasing the fragmentation velocity, decreasing the viscosity, or widening the dead zone transition width tends to reduce the effectiveness of dust trapping. The simulation results with \\texttt{RAPID} reveal that dust evolution is highly sensitive to the physical conditions of the disk, which governs the early stages of planetesimal growth.",

We use the Atmospheric Big Challenge (ABC) database, a publicly available dataset with over 100,000 simulated exoplanet spectra, to construct an anomaly detection scenario by defining CO2-rich atmospheres as anomalies and CO2-poor atmospheres as the normal class. We benchmarked four different anomaly detection strategies: Autoencoder Reconstruction Loss, One-Class Support Vector Machine (1 class-SVM), K-means Clustering, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). Each method was evaluated in both the original spectral space and the autoencoder's latent space using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics. To test the performance of the different methods under realistic conditions, we introduced Gaussian noise levels ranging from 10 to 50 ppm. Our results indicate that anomaly detection is consistently more effective when performed within the latent space across all noise levels. Specifically, K-means clustering in the latent space emerged as a stable and high-performing method. We demonstrate that this anomaly detection approach is robust to noise levels up to 30 ppm (consistent with realistic space-based observations) and remains viable even at 50 ppm when leveraging latent space representations. On the other hand, the performance of the anomaly detection methods applied directly in the raw spectral space degrades significantly with increasing the level of noise. This suggests that autoencoder-driven dimensionality reduction offers a robust methodology for flagging chemically anomalous targets in large-scale surveys where exhaustive retrievals are computationally prohibitive.",

To investigate this, we determined the abundances of 13 chemical elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni and Cu) for a sample of 561 Kepler exoplanet-hosting stars using high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectra. We find that stars in systems having only large or hot planets are enriched in some elements relative to those having only small or warm planets, respectively, with this signature being related to the underlying stellar metallicity. This Kepler sample is composed of stars belonging to the Galactic low- and high-$\\alpha$ sequences, corresponding to the chemical thin and thick disks. Our results reveal that stars enhanced in $\\alpha$-elements may facilitate the formation of large planets in metal-poor environments although the iron abundance is still a limiting factor. We also investigated chemical abundances as a function of elemental condensation temperatures and found that there is a diversity of slopes of regardless of the exoplanetary systems hosted by the star.

This open-endedness provides societies with the ability to continually expand their resources and to increase their capacity to store, transmit and process information at a collective-level. Here, we propose that the production of resources arises from the interaction between cultural systems (a society's repertoire of interdependent techniques, artifacts, norms and knowledge) and search spaces (an ensemble of needs, problems and goals facing a society). Starting from this premise we develop a macro-level model wherein both cultural systems and search spaces are subject to evolutionary dynamics. By manipulating the extent to which these dynamics are characterised by stochastic or selection-like processes, we demonstrate that open-ended growth is extremely rare, historically contingent and only possible when cultural systems and search spaces co-evolve. Here, stochastic factors must be strong enough to continually perturb the dynamics into a far-from-equilibrium state, whereas selection-like factors help maintain effectiveness and ensure the sustained production of resources. Only when this co-evolutionary dynamic maintains effective cultural systems, supports the ongoing expansion of the search space and leads to an increased provision of resources do we observe open-ended cultural evolution.",

Information propagation is closely linked to causality: how one part of a system influences another, and how some regions remain dynamically isolated. We apply this framework to the one-dimensional, highly nonlinear Kuramoto-Sivashinsky model and to the shallow-water equations, representing a mid-latitude atmospheric strip. Notably, we observe that information can propagate against the fluid flow, and that different model variables exhibit distinct patterns of information evolution. For example, pressure-related information propagates differently from relative vorticity, reflecting the influence of gravity waves versus balanced flow dynamics.

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.11411v5 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Understanding neural network's (NN) generalizability remains a central question in deep learning research. The special phenomenon of grokking, where NNs abruptly generalize long after the training performance reaches a near-perfect level, offers a unique window to investigate the underlying mechanisms of NNs' generalizability. Here we propose an interpretation for grokking by framing it as a computational glass relaxation: viewing NNs as a physical system where parameters are the degrees of freedom and train loss is the system energy, we find memorization process resembles a rapid cooling of liquid into non-equilibrium glassy state at low temperature and the later generalization is like a slow relaxation towards a more stable configuration. This mapping enables us to sample NNs' Boltzmann entropy (states of density) landscape as a function of training loss and test accuracy. Our experiments in transformers on arithmetic tasks suggests that there is NO entropy barrier in the memorization-to-generalization transition of grokking, challenging previous theory that defines grokking as a first-order phase transition. We identify a high-entropy advantage under grokking, an extension of prior work linking entropy to generalizability but much more significant. Inspired by grokking's far-from-equilibrium nature, we develop a toy optimizer WanD based on Wang-landau molecular dynamics, which can eliminate grokking without any constraints and find high-norm generalizing solutions. This provides strictly-defined counterexamples to theory attributing grokking solely to weight norm evolution towards the Goldilocks zone and also suggests new potential ways for optimizer design.",

Moreover, while recent studies of solar system Jupiter suggest that uppermost observable atmosphere may not represent the bulk envelope composition, it remains uncertain how the envelope inhomogeneity influences the atmospheric metallicity trend. In this study, we develop disk evolution and planet formation models to investigate the possible atmospheric metallicity trends of giant exoplanets formed via pebble accretion and how they depend on the metallicity inhomogeneity within the envelope. We find that pebble-based planet formation produces two distinct mass-metallicity relations depending on planetary birthplace. Planets formed beyond the H2O snowline exhibit a mass-metallicity anti-correlation similar to that predicted by planetesimal-based models if their atmospheres are fully convective. This anti-correlation disappears if the convective mixing is inefficient. In contrast, planets formed inside the H2O snowline show a shallower mass-metallicity anti-correlation, regardless of the efficiency of atmospheric mixing. Many gas giants observed by JWST observations lie around the mass-metallicity relation predicted for formation at close-in orbits, although some planets with sub-stellar atmospheric metallicity appear to require unmixed envelopes and formation beyond the H2O snowline. We also examine the relationship between bulk and atmospheric metallicity and find a clear correlation that closely follows atmospheric metallicity that is comparable to bulk metallicity.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02344v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The evolution of planet-forming regions in protoplanetary disks is of fundamental importance to understanding planet formation. Disks with a central deficit in dust emission, a \"cavity\", have long attracted interest as potential evidence for advanced disk clearing by protoplanets and/or winds. Before JWST, infrared spectra showed that these disks typically lack the strong molecular emission observed in full disks. In this work, we combine a sample of 12 disks with millimeter cavities of a range of sizes ($\\sim2$-70 au) and different levels of millimeter and infrared continuum deficits. We analyze their molecular spectra as observed with MIRI on JWST, homogeneously reduced with the new JDISCS pipeline. This analysis demonstrates a stark dichotomy in molecular emission where \"molecule-rich\" (MR) cavities follow global trends between water, CO, and OH luminosity and accretion luminosity as in full disks, while \"molecule-poor\" (MP) cavities are significantly sub-luminous in all molecules except sometimes OH. Disk cavities generally show sub-luminous organic emission, higher OH/H$_2$O ratios, and suggest a lower water column density. The sub-thermal excitation of CO and water vibrational lines suggests a decreased gas density in the emitting layer in all cavities, supporting model expectations for C$_2$H$_2$ photodissociation. We discover a bifurcation in infrared index (lower in MR cavities) suggesting that the molecular dichotomy is linked to residual $\\mu$m-size dust within millimeter disk cavities. Put together, these results suggest a feedback process between dust depletion, gas density decrease, and molecule dissociation. Disk cavities may have a common evolutionary sequence where MR switch into MP over time.",

Comparisons with Earth and other planets in the Solar System highlight the diversity of planetary conditions and the rarity of conditions relevant to life. We also discuss contingency and convergence in planetary and biological evolution as they relate to the spread of life in the universe. The observational limits of current and planned missions are assessed, emphasizing the need for models that connect internal dynamics to detectable atmospheric and surface signatures as well as the need for laboratory measurements of planetary properties under a wide range of conditions. The large number of exoplanets promises opportunities for empirical and statistical studies of processes that may have occurred earlier in Earth's history, as well as of the other pathways rocky planets and biospheres may take.

The results show that the region of the spiral phase will continuously expand with the increase of dissipation, gradually squeezing the original paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phase regions. Remarkably, unlike the conservative system, the introduction of dissipation will cause two spiral phases with opposite chiralities to emerge simultaneously in the system, which provides a possibility for the manipulation of spiral chirality in cold atomic experiments. Moreover, we reveal the mechanism of the dependence of the transformation between these two spiral phases with distinct chirality on the strength of the relative coefficient of off-diagonal Gamma interactions in the Ising-Gamma model. Since both the relevant order parameters and dissipation can be well controlled within a detectable range, these phenomena can be observed in ultracold atomic experiments.",

In particular, the low bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, compared to terrestrial planets in our solar system, require either substantial amount of volatiles to be present or a corefree scenario where the metallic core is fully oxidised. Here, using an updated metal-silicate partitioning model, we show that during core-mantle differentiation oxygen becomes more siderophile (iron-loving) implying larger planet radii. For the seven TRAPPIST-1 planets, however, we find that they are not sufficiently large to oxidise all the iron in the core, if they differentiate from an Earth-like composition. Oxygen partitioning in rocky worlds precludes coreless planets up to about 4 Earth masses. The observed density deficit in the TRAPPIST-1 planets, and more generally in M dwarf systems if confirmed by future observations, may be explained by system-dependent element budgets during planet formation, which are intrinsically linked to their stellar metallicity.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2512.15696v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Sprawling, turbulent cloud formations dominate the meteorology of Jupiter's mid-to-high latitudes, known as Folded Filamentary Regions (FFRs). A multi-wavelength characterisation by Juno reveals the spatial distribution, vertical structure, and energetics of the FFRs. The cloud tops display multiple lobes of stratiform aerosols, separated by darker, cloud-free lanes, and embedded with smaller eddies and high-altitude cumulus clouds. These cyclonic FFRs are microwave-bright in shallow-sounding wavelengths ($p<5$ bars) and microwave-dark in deep-sounding wavelengths ($p>10$ bars), with the transition potentially associated with the water condensation layer (6-7 bars). Associating microwave contrasts with temperature anomalies, this implies despinning of cyclonic eddies above/below their mid-planes. Despite deep roots (being detectable in wavelengths sounding $\\sim100$ bars), they are ``pancake vortices'' with horizontal extents at least an order of magnitude larger than their depth. In the northern hemisphere, FFRs are most common in cyclonic belts poleward of $40^\\circ$N (all latitudes are planetocentric), particularly a North Polar Filamentary Belt (NPFB) near $66-70^\\circ$N that defines the transition from organised belts/zones to the chaotic polar domain. This distribution explains the high lightning rates from $45-80^\\circ$N, peaking in a belt poleward of $52.3^\\circ$N, which may trace the availability of water for moist convection. Many observed lightning flashes can be associated to specific FFRs containing bright storms, but some FFRs display no activity, suggesting quiescent periods during storm evolution. Analogies to Earth's oceanic eddies suggest that cyclones deform isentropic surfaces at their midplanes, raising deep water-rich layers upwards to promote moist convection, release latent heat, and inject clouds into the upper troposphere.",

These particle showers broadly exhibit universality across diverse media, including air, water, ice, and other materials, with their development governed by the Standard Model. Full Monte Carlo simulation of particle showers, where each secondary is individually tracked and propagated, can be a computational challenge to perform at scale. Experiments thus resort to parametrized approximations when efficient simulation becomes necessary. Here, we construct distributions of parameters capable of describing the Cherenkov light yield from particle showers in ice, and extensible to other, similar media. Sampling from the distributions allows for a much improved description of event-to-event fluctuations, in amplitude and shape, along the shower axis. Including these effects is essential for a more accurate simulation of signal and background events in current and next-generation neutrino telescopes.",

In biological and synthetic systems, this curvature often coexists with directional sensing and non-reciprocal interactions. Motivated by this, we explore the collective dynamics of chiral intelligent active Brownian particles (iABPs) that combine polar alignment with vision-based sensing. By varying the ratio of alignment to visual maneuverability, the vision angle, and the reduced chirality $(\\omega/D_r)$, we construct a phase diagram exhibiting diverse collective states: spinners, vortices, ripples, worm-like swarms, rotary clusters, and irregular aggregates. Chirality critically governs their morphology: high chirality yields dilute phases, while moderate to low chirality produces cohesive yet dynamic patterns. Ripple loops emerge as a distinct state, characterized by expanding ring-like motion driven by outward torques and sustained only when both particle number and visual maneuverability are large. Structural and dynamical measures, including polarization, pair correlations, mean-square displacement, and orientation correlations, reveal clear signatures distinguishing these phases. Overall, our results show how chirality, non-reciprocal perception, and alignment together generate collective states inaccessible to non-chiral systems, with implications for chiral active matter in biological and synthetic contexts.",

A key development is a nonlinear neutrino-matter coupling algorithm based on nested fixed-point iteration with Anderson acceleration, enabling fully implicit treatment of collisional processes, including energy-coupling interactions such as neutrino-electron scattering and pair production. Coupling to finite-volume (FV) hydrodynamics is achieved with a hybrid DG-FV representation of the fluid variables and operator-split evolution in Flash-X. The implementation is verified using basic transport tests with idealized opacities and relaxation and deleptonization problems with tabulated microphysics. Spherically symmetric CCSN simulations demonstrate accuracy and robustness of the coupled scheme, including close agreement with the CCSN simulation code Chimera. An axisymmetric CCSN simulation further demonstrates the viability of DG-based neutrino transport for multidimensional supernova modeling within Flash-X. thornado's neutrino-transport solver is GPU-enabled using OpenMP offloading or OpenACC, and all CCSN applications included in this work use the GPU implementation.

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.01909v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We investigate the evolution of anisotropies in Bianchi I spacetimes within the framework of the 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar field theory. The field equations are formulated using dimensionless variables, and the asymptotic dynamics are studied through a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. For the locally rotationally symmetric case, we analytically explore the stationary points of the field equations. The analysis reveals the existence of accelerating solutions in which the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet scalar effectively play the role of a cosmological constant. As a result, both anisotropic and isotropic expanding solutions are recovered, along with the Minkowski spacetime. No scaling solutions are supported by the gravitational model. For the general anisotropic Bianchi I geometry with three distinct scale factors, we find that a class of compactified Kasner-like solutions is obtained. In addition, a new family of solutions follows, describing a two-dimensional splitting of the background geometry. This behavior is similar to the previously observed pure Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in higher-dimensional spacetimes.",

In particular, we demonstrate that two subsystem symmetries-previously studied primarily in exotic field theories-arise intrinsically in the dynamics of shallow water flows. A central result is that the local conservation of potential vorticity follows directly from the first subsystem symmetry, revealing that the classic Kelvin circulation theorem is rooted in these symmetries. Notably, the associated charge algebra forms a Kac-Moody current algebra, with the level determined by the spatial variation of the Coriolis parameter. Beyond the first subsystem symmetry, we also identify a second one, construct the corresponding Noether charges, and explore their potential applications.",

As a physical application, we formulate a constitutive law for aging viscoelastic materials with infinite memory. Crucially, we analytically demonstrate the \"Amnesia Phenomenon\": we prove that rapid aging modulates the system's history, effectively transforming the hereditary power-law decay into a short-range exponential relaxation. This result provides a closed-form explanation for the loss of memory in fast-aging media, overcoming the computational bottlenecks of standard discretization methods.",

This open-endedness provides societies with the ability to continually expand their resources and to increase their capacity to store, transmit and process information at a collective-level. Here, we propose that the production of resources arises from the interaction between cultural systems (a society's repertoire of interdependent techniques, artifacts, norms and knowledge) and search spaces (an ensemble of needs, problems and goals facing a society). Starting from this premise we develop a macro-level model wherein both cultural systems and search spaces are subject to evolutionary dynamics. By manipulating the extent to which these dynamics are characterised by stochastic or selection-like processes, we demonstrate that open-ended growth is extremely rare, historically contingent and only possible when cultural systems and search spaces co-evolve. Here, stochastic factors must be strong enough to continually perturb the dynamics into a far-from-equilibrium state, whereas selection-like factors help maintain effectiveness and ensure the sustained production of resources. Only when this co-evolutionary dynamic maintains effective cultural systems, supports the ongoing expansion of the search space and leads to an increased provision of resources do we observe open-ended cultural evolution.",

The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems.

In biological and synthetic systems, this curvature often coexists with directional sensing and non-reciprocal interactions. Motivated by this, we explore the collective dynamics of chiral intelligent active Brownian particles (iABPs) that combine polar alignment with vision-based sensing. By varying the ratio of alignment to visual maneuverability, the vision angle, and the reduced chirality $(\\omega/D_r)$, we construct a phase diagram exhibiting diverse collective states: spinners, vortices, ripples, worm-like swarms, rotary clusters, and irregular aggregates. Chirality critically governs their morphology: high chirality yields dilute phases, while moderate to low chirality produces cohesive yet dynamic patterns. Ripple loops emerge as a distinct state, characterized by expanding ring-like motion driven by outward torques and sustained only when both particle number and visual maneuverability are large. Structural and dynamical measures, including polarization, pair correlations, mean-square displacement, and orientation correlations, reveal clear signatures distinguishing these phases. Overall, our results show how chirality, non-reciprocal perception, and alignment together generate collective states inaccessible to non-chiral systems, with implications for chiral active matter in biological and synthetic contexts.",

The reliability of this approach was verified through complementary NPT simulations. We further demonstrate the pronounced sensitivity of the estimated critical point to the van der Waals cutoff distance, underscoring the importance of properly accounting for long-range interactions.

This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach's assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.01010v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We provide an overview of high dimensional dynamical systems driven by random matrices, focusing on applications to simple models of learning and generalization in machine learning theory. Using both cavity method arguments and path integrals, we review how the behavior of a coupled infinite dimensional system can be characterized as a stochastic process for each single site of the system. We provide a pedagogical treatment of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), a framework that can be flexibly applied to these settings. The DMFT single site stochastic process is fully characterized by a set of (two-time) correlation and response functions. For linear time-invariant systems, we illustrate connections between random matrix resolvents and the DMFT response. We demonstrate applications of these ideas to machine learning models such as gradient flow, stochastic gradient descent on random feature models and deep linear networks in the feature learning regime trained on random data. We demonstrate how bias and variance decompositions (analysis of ensembling/bagging etc) can be computed by averaging over subsets of the DMFT noise variables. From our formalism we also investigate how linear systems driven with random non-Hermitian matrices (such as random feature models) can exhibit non-monotonic loss curves with training time, while Hermitian matrices with the matching spectra do not, highlighting a different mechanism for non-monotonicity than small eigenvalues causing instability to label noise. Lastly, we provide asymptotic descriptions of the training and test loss dynamics for randomly initialized deep linear neural networks trained in the feature learning regime with high-dimensional random data. In this case, the time translation invariance structure is lost and the hidden layer weights are characterized as spiked random matrices.",

Two main regimes are typically observed: Variable Range Hopping and Nearest Neighbor Hopping, with a transition between them upon temperature variation. Despite numerous experimental observations, the modeling of this transition remain insufficiently explored and not fully understood. In this work, we present an in-house Monte Carlo Random Resistor Network-based simulator capable of capturing both hopping transport regimes. We demonstrate how material properties that define the network, such as localization length and the spatial and energetic distribution of sites, determine the dominant transport regime. The simulator has been successfully validated against experimental data, showing excellent agreement, reproducing the transition from one regime to the other and accurately capturing 1D, 2D and 3D variable range hopping behavior, providing both a theoretical framework for interpreting experiments and a powerful tool for studying transport mechanisms.",

The second examines the propagation of an electromagnetic pulse through a one-dimensional, lossless transmission line with randomly varying propagation constant and characteristic impedance along its length, a system that captures the interference effects essential for true Anderson localization.

By applying a linear Stark potential selectively to one sublattice of a dimerized chain, we generate an effective Hamiltonian with unbounded, staggered hopping amplitudes. The unbounded nature of the hopping places the model outside the scope of the Simon-Spencer theorem, while the staggered scaling allows it to evade broader constraints on Jacobi matrices. We analytically derive the bulk spectrum in reciprocal space, identifying a sharp ME where the energy magnitude equals the inter-cell hopping strength. This edge separates a continuum of extended states from two distinct localized branches: a standard unbounded Wannier-Stark ladder and an anomalous bounded branch accumulating at the ME. The existence of extended states is supported by finite-size scaling of the inverse participation ratio up to system sizes $L \\sim 10^9$. Furthermore, we propose an experimental realization using photonic frequency synthetic dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that the ME is robust against potential experimental imperfections, including frequency detuning errors and photon loss, establishing a practical path for observing MEs in disorder-free systems.",

Across proteins, spider webs and flame dynamics, vibrational and architectural principles recur as tonal hierarchies, harmonic progressions, and long-range musical form. Using reversible mappings, from molecular spectra to musical tones and from three-dimensional networks to playable instruments, we show how sound functions as a scientific probe, an epistemic inversion where listening becomes a mode of seeing and musical composition becomes a blueprint for matter. These mappings excavate deep time: patterns originating in femtosecond molecular vibrations or billion-year evolutionary histories become audible. We posit that novelty in science and art emerges when constraints cannot be satisfied within existing degrees of freedom, forcing expansion of the space of viable configurations. Selective imperfection provides the mechanism restoring balance between coherence and adaptability. Quantitative support comes from exhaustive enumeration of all 2^12 musical scales, revealing that culturally significant systems cluster in a mid-entropy, mid-defect corridor, directly paralleling the Hall-Petch optimum where intermediate defect densities maximize material strength. Iterating these mappings creates productive collisions between human creativity and physics, generating new information as musical structures encounter evolutionary constraints. We show how swarm-based AI models compose music exhibiting human-like structural signatures such as small-world connectivity, modular integration, long-range coherence, suggesting a route beyond interpolation toward invention.

As transistors are scaled to even smaller dimensions, device channels inevitably enter low-dimensional regimes to achieve higher performance. Low-dimensional materials such as atomically thin oxide semiconductors, 2D van der Waals semiconductors, and 1D carbon nanotubes, have thus emerged as key candidates for extending Moore's law. Here, we reveal the fundamental distinction between three-dimensional and low-dimensional conductors arising from disorder-induced electron localization, which leads to the breakdown of Ohm's law and lateral linear scaling. We develop a quantitative model that captures the role of the disordered region, a unique characteristic intrinsically to low-dimensional transistors. Furthermore, the disorder-induced localization framework consistently explains experimental observations in atomically thin In2O3 field-effect transistors across variations in channel length, temperature, thickness, and post-annealing conditions.

Using a two-dimensional array of superconducting qubits, we study an interacting spin model at finite temperature in a disordered landscape, tracking dynamics both in real space and in Hilbert space. Over a broad disorder range, we observe an intermediate non-ergodic regime with glass-like characteristics: physical observables become broadly distributed and some, but not all, degrees of freedom are effectively frozen. The Hilbert-space return probability shows slow power-law decay, consistent with finite-temperature quantum glassiness. In the same regime, we detect the onset of a finite Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the disappearance of spin diffusion. By contrast, at lower disorder, spin transport persists with a nonzero diffusion coefficient. Our results show that there is a transition out of the ergodic phase in two-dimensional systems.",

In this Letter, we introduce a powerful framework, termed multi-bipartition entanglement tomography, which probes the fine structure of entanglement across an exhaustive ensemble of distinct bipartitions. Our cornerstone is the discovery of a ``bond-additive law'', which reveals that the entanglement entropy can be precisely decomposed into a bulk volume-law baseline plus a geometric correction formed by a sum of local contributions from crossed bonds of varying ranges. This law distills complex entanglement landscapes into a concise set of entanglement bond tensions $\\{\\omega_j\\}$, serving as a quantitative fingerprint of interaction locality. By applying this tomography to Hamiltonian dynamics, random quantum circuits, and Floquet dynamics, we resolve a fundamental distinction between thermalization mechanisms: Hamiltonian thermalized states retain a persistent geometric imprint characterized by a significantly non-zero $\\omega_1$, while this structure is completely erased in random quantum circuit and Floquet dynamics. Our work establishes multi-bipartition entanglement tomography as a versatile toolbox for the geometric structure of quantum information in many-body systems.",

Time dependent square displacements are calculated directly from numerical solutions of Pauli master equations, for five different rate kernels: exact Fermi golden rule (FGR) rate expression, stationary phase interpolation (SPI) approximation, semiclassical (SC) approximation, classical Marcus rate expression, and Miller-Abrahams expression. All results demonstrate diffusive behavior in the steady state limit. The results based on the FGR rate expression show that the charge transport in quantum bath can be much more sensitive to the disorder than the prediction from the classical Marcus expression. While the SPI approximation captures this general trend reasonably well, the SC approximation tends to be unreliable at both quantitative and qualitative levels, and becomes even worse than the classical Marcus expression under certain conditions. These results offer useful guidance in the choice of approximate rate kernels for larger scale simulations, and also demonstrate significant but fragile positive effects of quantum environments on the charge hopping dynamics.",

Phys. 5, 230 (2022)]. Specifically, when such a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an aperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension. In this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological crystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$) symmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological branes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust endpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap modes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being devoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that such branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and weak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states residing near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects, besides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers. Finally, we showcase a successful incarnation of a square lattice-based second-order topological insulator with the characteristic corner-localized zero modes in its geometric descendant one-dimensional quasi-crystalline or crystalline branes that feature a quantized localizer index and endpoint zero-energy modes only when one of its end points passes through a corner of the parent crystal.

We show that there exist instances of allocating indivisible items to $n$ couples for which envy-freeness up to $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ items cannot be guaranteed. This closes the gap by matching the upper bound of Manurangsi and Suksompong, which applies to arbitrary instances with $n$ agents in total.

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.01496v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In this paper, we settle the problem of learning optimal linear contracts from data in the offline setting, where agent types are drawn from an unknown distribution and the principal's goal is to design a contract that maximizes her expected utility. Specifically, our analysis shows that the simple Empirical Utility Maximization (EUM) algorithm yields an $\\varepsilon$-approximation of the optimal linear contract with probability at least $1-\\delta$, using just $O(\\ln(1/\\delta) / \\varepsilon^2)$ samples. This result improves upon previously known bounds and matches a lower bound from Duetting et al. [2025] up to constant factors, thereby proving its optimality. Our analysis uses a chaining argument, where the key insight is to leverage a simple structural property of linear contracts: their expected reward is non-decreasing. This property, which holds even though the utility function itself is non-monotone and discontinuous, enables the construction of fine-grained nets required for the chaining argument, which in turn yields the optimal sample complexity. Furthermore, our proof establishes the stronger guarantee of uniform convergence: the empirical utility of every linear contract is a $\\varepsilon$-approximation of its true expectation with probability at least $1-\\delta$, using the same optimal $O(\\ln(1/\\delta) / \\varepsilon^2)$ sample complexity.",

Although this ballot format has desirable characteristics, there is a question of whether it is expressive enough for the agents. Kahng, Latifian, and Shah address this issue by adding intensities to the rankings. They introduce the ranking with intensities ballot format, where agents can use both $\\succ\\!\\!\\succ$ and $\\succ$ in their rankings to express intensive and normal preferences between consecutive alternatives in their rankings. While they focus on analyzing this ballot format in the utilitarian distortion framework, in this work, we look at the potential of using this ballot format from the metric distortion viewpoint. We design a class of voting rules coined Positional Scoring Matching rules, which can be used for different problems in the metric setting, and show that by solving a zero-sum game, we can find the optimal member of this class for our problem. This rule takes intensities into account and achieves a distortion lower than $3$. In addition, by proving a bound on the price of ignoring intensities, we show that we might lose a great deal in terms of distortion by not taking the intensities into account.",

The LLM is characterized by (i) a propensity parameter capturing its internal bias toward high-price recommendations and (ii) an output-fidelity parameter measuring how tightly outputs track that bias; the propensity evolves through retraining. We show that configuring LLMs for robustness and reproducibility can induce collusion via a phase transition: there exists a critical output-fidelity threshold that pins down long-run behavior. Below it, competitive pricing is the unique long-run outcome. Above it, the system is bistable, with competitive and collusive pricing both locally stable and the realized outcome determined by the model's initial preference. The collusive regime resembles tacit collusion: prices are elevated on average, yet occasional low-price recommendations provide plausible deniability. With perfect fidelity, full collusion emerges from any interior initial condition. For finite training batches of size $b$, infrequent retraining (driven by computational costs) further amplifies collusion: conditional on starting in the collusive basin, the probability of collusion approaches one as $b$ grows, since larger batches dampen stochastic fluctuations that might otherwise tip the system toward competition. The indeterminacy region shrinks at rate $O(1/\\sqrt{b})$.",

To resolve this, we propose a negotiation-based framework that, by design, guarantees voluntary participation, strategy-proofness, and budget feasibility. It transforms EV charging into a strategic resource by offering drivers a range of incentive-backed options for modest flexibility in their departure time or requested state of charge (SoC). Our framework is calibrated with user survey data and validated using real operational data from a commercial building and an EV manufacturer. Simulations show that our negotiation protocol creates a mutually beneficial outcome: lowering the building operator's costs by over 3.5\\% compared to an optimized, non-negotiating smart charging policy, while simultaneously reducing user charging expenses by 22\\% below the utility's retail energy rate. By aligning operator and EV user objectives, our framework provides a strategic bridge between energy and mobility systems, transforming EV charging from a source of operational friction into a platform for collaboration and shared savings.",

We analyze economic mechanisms for privacy-aware transaction owners whose utility depends not only on the outcome of the mechanism but also negatively on the exposure of their economic preferences. First, we consider an order flow auction, where a user auctions off to specialized agents, called searchers, the right to execute her transaction while maintaining a degree of privacy. We examine how the degree of privacy affects the revenue of the auction and, broadly, the net utility of the privacy-aware user. In this new setting, we characterize the optimal auction, which is a sealed-bid auction. Subsequently, we analyze a variant of a Dutch auction in which the user gradually decreases the price and the degree of privacy until the transaction is sold. We compare the revenue of this auction to that of the optimal one as a function of the number of communication rounds. Then, we introduce a two-sided market - a privacy marketplace - with multiple users selling their transactions under their privacy preferences to multiple searchers. We propose a posted-price mechanism for the two-sided market that guarantees constant approximation of the optimal social welfare while maintaining incentive compatibility (from both sides of the market) and budget balance. This work builds on the emerging literature on privacy-preserving mechanism design, integrating statistical privacy guarantees into economic protocols to capture the impact of information leakage on blockchain users' utility.",

By asymmetrically collapsing the marginal cost of generating low-quality, synthetic content while leaving high-quality production costly, AI systematically incentivizes information pollution. This paper develops a general equilibrium framework to analyze this challenge. We model the strategic interactions among a monopolistic platform, profit-maximizing producers, and utility-maximizing consumers in a three-stage game. The core of our model is a production technology with differential elasticities of substitution (\\sigma_L > 1 > \\sigma_H), which formalizes the insight that AI is a substitute for labor in low-quality production but a complement in high-quality creation. We prove the existence of a unique \"Polluted Information Equilibrium\" and demonstrate its inefficiency, which is driven by a threefold market failure: a production externality, a platform governance failure, and an information commons externality. Methodologically, we derive a theoretically-grounded Information Pollution Index (IPI) with endogenous welfare weights to measure ecosystem health. From a policy perspective, we show that a first-best outcome requires a portfolio of instruments targeting each failure. Finally, considering the challenges of deep uncertainty, we advocate for an adaptive governance framework where policy instruments are dynamically adjusted based on real-time IPI readings, offering a robust blueprint for regulating information markets in the age of AI.",

To address this, we investigate emergent dynamical behaviors in a wheel network of R\\\"ossler and Lorenz oscillators that incorporates both pairwise (1-simplex) and higher-order (2-simplex) interactions under three coupling schemes, namely, diffusive, conjugate, and mean-field diffusive coupling. Our numerical analysis reveals four distinct collective behaviors: synchronization, desynchronization, chimera states, and synchronized clusters. To systematically classify these dynamical behaviors, we introduce two statistical measures that effectively capture synchronization patterns among arbitrarily positioned nodes. Applying these measures across all dynamical models and coupling schemes (six different models in total), we show that both pairwise and higher-order interactions crucially influence the emergence and robustness of chimera states. We observe that under pairwise interaction alone, chimera states appear with high prevalence in specific coupling ranges, though the robustness depends on both the coupling scheme and the underlying dynamical system. Incorporation of higher-order interactions reveals that the higher-order interaction underlying diffusive coupling enhances chimera states in both R\\\"ossler and Lorenz networks; under conjugate coupling, it strengthens chimera states in Lorenz but instead promotes full synchronization in R\\\"ossler; and under mean-field diffusive coupling, higher-order interactions generally favor synchronization, particularly for R\\\"ossler oscillators, but promote chimera in the Lorenz system for the intermediate range of its strengths. Overall, our results demonstrate that higher-order interactions can significantly modulate, promote, or suppress chimera states depending on the coupling mechanism and oscillator dynamics.",

Despite their key role in the ergodic theory approach to fluid turbulence, identifying UPOs is challenging for two reasons: chaotic dynamics and the high-dimensionality of the spatial discretization. We address both issues at once by proposing a loop convergence algorithm for UPOs directly within a low-dimensional embedding of the chaotic attractor. The convergence algorithm circumvents time-integration, hence avoiding instabilities from exponential error amplification, and operates on a latent dynamics obtained by pulling back the physical equations using automatic differentiation through the learned embedding function. The interpretable latent dynamics is accurate in a statistical sense, and, crucially, the embedding preserves the internal structure of the attractor, which we demonstrate through an equivalence between the latent and physical UPOs of both a model PDE and the 2D Navier-Stokes equations. This allows us to exploit the collapse of high-dimensional dissipative systems onto a lower dimensional manifold, and identify UPOs in the low-dimensional embedding.",

However, its scalability has long been constrained by an intrinsic trade-off between bandwidth and the number of parallel chaotic channels. Here, we introduce a programmable \"chaos-on-comb\" architecture that overcomes this limitation using standard electro-optic components. By heterodyning a delayed-feedback chaotic laser with a continuous-wave reference, a broadband chaotic microwave signal is generated to simultaneously drive a cascaded electro-optic comb, imprinting chaotic dynamics across all comb lines and merging them into an ultra-broadband chaotic continuum. Then, incorporating spectrum slicing enables flexible extraction of parallel chaotic channels with preserved statistical independence and per-channel programmability. As a result, we demonstrate a single-channel ultra-broadband optical chaos with an effective bandwidth of 543.8 GHz, and a broadband terahertz noise source with an excess noise ratio of 52.99 \\pm 2.85 dB to validate its flatness.

We model how banks, constrained by Value-at-Risk (VaR) regulations, adjust their leverage in response to changes in the price of a single asset, assumed to be held in fixed proportion across banks. This leverage-targeting behavior introduces a procyclical feedback loop between asset prices and leverage. In the dynamics, this can manifest as logistic-like behavior with a rich bifurcation structure across model parameters. By analyzing these coupled dynamics in both isolated and interconnected bank models, we outline a framework for understanding how systemic risk can emerge from seemingly rational micro-level behavior.",

The calculations can be further accelerated and optimised by applying a random sampling procedure, in which only a subset of line structures is evaluated. These modifications result in shorter run times, less memory use and access, and lower overall energy consumption during analysis while maintaining accuracy. This makes them especially appealing for large-scale data analysis and machine learning applications. The ideas are not limited to diagonal line measures, but can likewise be applied to vertical line-based measures and to recurrence network measures.

Application to the Lorenz-96 dynamical system in chaotic regime, as well as to a modified Hasegawa-Wakatani (mHW) model of drift-wave turbulence in the edge of a tokamak plasma reveals that for both of the models their essential dynamics is best described as a metastable regime-switching process, making infrequent transitions between the very persistent low-dimensional manifolds. At the same time, the Markovian mean exit times and relaxation times (that bound the predictability horizons for the identified regime-switching process) appear to decrease only very slowly with the growing external forcing - indicating approximately two-fold longer prediction horizons then is currently anticipated based on analysis of positive Lyapunov exponents, even in very chaotic model regimes. It is also demonstrated that when applied for a lossy compression of the Lorenz-96 and mHW output data in various forcing regimes, EOMC achieves several orders of magnitude smaller compression loss - when compared to the common PCA-related linear compression approaches that build a backbone of the state-of-the-art lossy data compression tools (like JPEG, MP3, and others).

Although distinguishing saccades from fixations is not trivial, experimentalists generally use common ad-hoc thresholds in detection algorithms. This neglects inter-task and inter-individual variability in oculomotor dynamics, and potentially biases the resulting statistics. In this article, we introduce and evaluate an adaptive method based on a Markovian approximation of eye-gaze dynamics, using saccades and fixations as states such that the optimal threshold minimizes state transitions. Applying this to three common threshold-based algorithms (velocity, angular velocity, and dispersion), we evaluate the overall accuracy against a multi-threshold benchmark as well as robustness to noise. We find that a velocity threshold achieves the highest baseline accuracy (90-93\\%) across both free-viewing and visual search tasks. However, velocity-based methods degrade rapidly under noise when thresholds remain fixed, with accuracy falling below 20% at high noise levels. Adaptive threshold optimization via K-ratio minimization substantially improves performance under noisy conditions for all algorithms. Adaptive dispersion thresholds demonstrate superior noise robustness, maintaining accuracy above 81% even at extreme noise levels ({\\sigma} = 50 px), though a precision-recall trade-off emerges that favors fixation detection at the expense of saccade identification. In addition to demonstrating our parsimonious adaptive thresholding method, these findings provide practical guidance for selecting and tuning classification algorithms based on data quality and analytical priorities.",

Such a state corresponds to a strategy adopted by the population such that a rare mutant strategy cannot invade the population. In parallel, the dynamical formulation of evolutionary game theory -- particularly through replicator dynamics embodying the tenet of survival of the fittest -- provides a framework for modelling frequency-dependent selection over time. While it is well known that an ESS corresponds to stable fixed point in replicator dynamics, the evolutionary game-theoretic characterization of limit cycles is unknown. Here we fill this lacuna by defining oscillatory ESS (OESS) which we prove to be a stable limit cycle. We also show when an OESS is unique and if there are multiple OESSes, then what their locations are in the phase space.",

    "title": "A Mathematical Model to Capture Urbanization Trajectory Induced by Economic Inequality",
    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00881v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Analysis of the urban population fraction data for sixteen populous countries over the last fifty years reveals a universal increase in urbanization, exhibiting four qualitatively distinct temporal patterns: (i) continuously accelerating growth, (ii) continuously decelerating growth, (iii) two-phase growth transitioning from acceleration to deceleration, and (iv) two-phase growth transitioning from deceleration to acceleration. To understand the origin of these diverse urbanization trajectories, we develop a simple coarse-grained model in which a country is segregated into two regions, a rural and an urban region. Population in each region evolves due to natural (sexual) growth and migration from rural to urban areas, with the migration rate governed by economic inequality, quantified through the difference in GDP per capita between the two regions. The GDP per capita of both regions is assumed to grow exponentially with distinct rates. We demonstrate that this minimal model, involving four dynamical variables and a small number of demographic and economic parameters, is capable of reproducing all four empirically observed urbanization patterns. Assuming demographic and economic parameters remain approximately constant over a 50-year timescale, we estimate coarse-grained parameters for the United States using empirical data and obtain optimized values that accurately reproduce its observed urbanization trajectory. Our results highlight how simple demographic-economic interactions can generate rich and diverse urbanization dynamics.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.01882v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Many real-world scale-free networks, such as neural networks and online communication networks, consist of a fixed number of nodes but exhibit dynamic edge fluctuations. However, traditional models frequently overlook scenarios where the node count remains constant, instead prioritizing node growth. In this work, we depart from the assumptions of node number variation and preferential attachment to present an innovative model that conceptualizes node degree fluctuations as a state-dependent random walk process with stasis and variable diffusion coefficient. We show that this model yields stochastic dynamic networks with stable scale-free properties. Through comprehensive theoretical and numerical analyses, we demonstrate that the degree distribution converges to a power-law distribution, provided that the lowest degree state within the network is not an absorbing state. Furthermore, we investigate the resilience of the fraction of the largest component and the average shortest path length following deliberate attacks on the network. By using three real-world networks, we confirm that the proposed model accurately replicates actual data. The proposed model thus elucidates mechanisms by which networks, devoid of growth and preferential attachment features, can still exhibit power-law distributions and be used to simulate and study the resilience of attacked fixed-size scale-free networks.",

Whether or not a system returns to a given stable state after being perturbed away from it depends on the shape and extent of its basin of attraction. In this Letter, we show that basins of attraction in multiscale systems can exhibit special geometric properties in the form of universal singular funnels. We use the term singular basins to refer to basins of attraction with singular funnels. We show that singular basins occur robustly in a range of dynamical systems: the normal form of a pitchfork bifurcation with a slowly changing parameter, an adaptive active rotator, and an adaptive network of phase rotators. Although singular funnels are narrow, they can extend to different parts of the phase space and, unexpectedly, impact the resilience of the system to disturbances. Crucially, the presence of a singular funnel may prevent the usual dimensionality reductions in the limit of large timescale separation, such as quasi-static approximation, adiabatic elimination or time-averaging of the fast variables",

In this article, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative phase rigidity supercurrents, a mapping we confirm empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity. Generalizing this framework to three dimensions ($S^1\\to S^2$), we show that polar alignment on the unit sphere is geometrically equivalent to the Gilbert damping term in spintronics, and that the two-dimensional Kuramoto coupling term naturally appears in the tangent-plane projection of spin relaxation. This constraint generates inertial spin waves (ferromagnetic magnons) from the overdamped active bath, recovering the macroscopic transport predicted by Toner-Tu theory without invoking microscopic inertia. Our results show that all polar chiral agents who seek to align on the unit sphere strictly constitute a dissipative spintronic fluid, where phase gradient transport is ensured by the Goldstone modes of the underlying broken symmetry.",

While the logical dimension and quantum distance of \\emph{coprime} BB codes are known to be determined by a greatest common divisor polynomial $g(z)$, the properties governing their fault tolerance under noisy measurement have remained implicit. In this work, we prove that this same polynomial $g(z)$ dictates the code's stabilizer redundancy and the structure of the classical \\emph{syndrome codes} required for single-shot decoding. We derive a strict equality between the quantum rate and the stabilizer redundancy density, and we provide BCH-like bounds on the achievable single-shot measurement error tolerance. Guided by this framework, we construct small coprime BB codes with significantly improved syndrome distance ($d_S$) and evaluate them using BP+OSD. Our analysis reveals a structural bottleneck: within the coprime BB ansatz, high quantum rate imposes an upper bound on syndrome distance, limiting single-shot performance.

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.01194v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Amplify and forward (AF) relaying is a viable strategy to extend the coverage of sub-terahertz (sub-THz) links, but inevitably propagates noise, leading to cumulative degradation across multiple hops. At the receiver, optimal decoding is desirable, yet challenging under non-Gaussian input distributions (video, voice, etc), for which neither the Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) estimator nor the mutual information admits a closed form. A further open question is whether knowledge of Channel State Information (CSI) and noise statistics at the intermediate relays is necessary for optimal detection. Aiming for an optimal decoder, this paper introduces a new framework that interprets the AF relay chain as a variance-preserving diffusion process and employs denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs) for signal recovery. We show that each AF hop is mathematically equivalent to a diffusion step with hop-dependent attenuation and noise injection. Consequently, the entire multi-hop chain collapses to an equivalent Gaussian channel fully described by only three real scalars per block: the cumulative complex gain and the effective noise variance. At the receiver, these end-to-end sufficient statistics define a matched reverse schedule that guides the DDIM-based denoiser, enabling near-optimal Bayesian decoding without per-hop CSI. We establish the information-theoretic foundation of this equivalence, proving that decoding performance depends solely on the final effective Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR), regardless of intermediate noise/channel allocation or prior distribution. Simulations under AWGN and Rician fading confirm that the proposed AF-DDIM decoder reduces mean-squared error, symbol error rate, and bit error rate, particularly at moderate SNRs and for higher-order constellations.",

Defining complexity and actually measuring it is an ongoing debate and no standard framework has been established that is both theoretically sound and computationally practical to use. Currently, one of the fields which attempts to formally define complexity is in the realm of Algorithmic Information Theory. The field has shown advances by studying the outputs of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional Turing machines to determine the complexity values of binary strings and 2-dimensional binary matrices respectively. Using these complexity values, an algorithm called the Block Decomposition Method developed by Zenil, et al. in 2018, has been created to approximate the complexity of adjacency matrices of graphs which has found relative success in grouping graphs based on their complexity values. We use this method along with another method called edge perturbation to exhaustively determine if an edge can be identified to connect two sub-graphs within a graph using the entire symmetric group of its vertices permutation and via unique permutations we call automorphic subsets, which is a special subset of the symmetric group. We also analyze if edges will be grouped closer to their respective sub-graphs in terms of the average algorithmic information contribution.

The resulting geometry admits closed-form expressions for distances and geodesics, and has constant positive curvature. Under explicit restrictions, composition enforces boundary faces through rank constraints and, in an aligned model with stated idealisations, induces a non-linear re-weighting of spectral states.

As a result, there is an increasing demand for efficient and intelligent algorithms that can operate under uncertainty from both propagation environments and networking systems. Traditional optimization methods often depend on accurate theoretical models of data transmission, but in real-world NG scenarios, they suffer from high computational complexity in large-scale settings. Stochastic Optimization (SO) algorithms, designed to accommodate extremely high density and extensive network scalability, have emerged as a powerful solution for optimizing wireless networks. This includes various categories that range from model-based approaches to learning-based approaches. These techniques are capable of converging within a feasible time frame while addressing complex, large-scale optimization problems. However, there is currently limited research on SO applied for NG networks, especially the upcoming Sixth-Generation (6G).

Overall, our study starts by providing a detailed overview of both areas, covering fundamental and widely used SO techniques, spanning from single to multi-objective signal processing. Next, we explore how different algorithms can solve NG challenges, such as load balancing, optimizing energy efficiency, improving spectral efficiency, or handling multiple performance trade-offs.

The complete decoding process can be performed using only the parity-check matrix, without requiring any other pre-constructed information (such as trellis diagrams or error-pattern lists), and it can also be customized by exploiting the algebraic properties of the code. We formally define error-building blocks, and derive a recursive theorem that allows efficient construction of larger locally optimal blocks from smaller ones, thereby effectively searching for the block associated with the most likely error pattern. The EBD framework is further optimized for extended Hamming codes as an example, through offline and online exclusion mechanisms, leading to a substantial complexity reduction without loss of ML performance. Complexity analysis shows that, for extended Hamming codes of lengths 64, 128, and 256, the fully optimized EBD requires approximately an order of magnitude fewer floating-point operations on average than minimum-edge trellis Viterbi decoding at a frame error rate of $10^{-3}$.",

To reduce energy, it is important to choose the right LRM and operate it in the right way. As a result, the performance of systems that dispatch tasks to different individual LRMs depend on the balance between mean energy provisioning and stochastic fluctuations. The critical regime is the unique operating point at which neither auxiliary energy nor baseline energy is systematically wasted. Increasing baseline supply shifts the system toward persistent over-supply and baseline-energy waste, while reducing supply induces persistent reliance on auxiliary energy. Yet in this regime, performance remains volatility-limited and so a second-order characterization provides further insights that we develop. Here, performance is governed by how variability is absorbed across time, models, and execution choices. This perspective highlights variance-aware routing and dispatch as a principled design axis, and provides a theoretical basis for developing energy-aware model routing policies. Routing behavior is characterized when dispatch policies are based on training-compute and inference-compute scaling laws for LRMs.",

We show that one-in-seven moderation cases are disputed among moderators, often addressing transgressions where users' intent is not directly legible, such as in trolling and brigading, as well as tensions around community governance. This is concerning, as almost half of all gray area cases involved automated moderation decisions. Through information-theoretic evaluations, we demonstrate that gray area cases are inherently harder to adjudicate than undisputed cases and show that state-of-the-art language models struggle to adjudicate them.

    "title": "Rethinking Secure Semantic Communications in the Age of Generative and Agentic AI: Threats and Opportunities",
    "summary": "arXiv:2601.01791v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) improves communication efficiency by transmitting task-relevant information instead of raw bits and is expected to be a key technology for 6G networks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI) further enhance SemCom by enabling robust semantic encoding and decoding under limited channel conditions. However, these efficiency gains also introduce new security and privacy vulnerabilities. Due to the broadcast nature of wireless channels, eavesdroppers can also use powerful GenAI-based semantic decoders to recover private information from intercepted signals. Moreover, rapid advances in agentic AI enable eavesdroppers to perform long-term and adaptive inference through the integration of memory, external knowledge, and reasoning capabilities. This allows eavesdroppers to further infer user private behavior and intent beyond the transmitted content. Motivated by these emerging challenges, this paper comprehensively rethinks the security and privacy of SemCom systems in the age of generative and agentic AI. We first present a systematic taxonomy of eavesdropping threat models in SemCom systems. Then, we provide insights into how GenAI and agentic AI can enhance eavesdropping threats. Meanwhile, we also highlight potential opportunities for leveraging GenAI and agentic AI to design privacy-preserving SemCom systems.",

This study investigates whether surprisal, a probabilistic measure of predictability in LMs, correlates with different metaphor novelty datasets. We analyse surprisal from 16 LM variants on corpus-based and synthetic metaphor novelty datasets. We explore a cloze-style surprisal method that conditions on full-sentence context. Results show that LMs yield significant moderate correlations with scores/labels of metaphor novelty. We further identify divergent scaling patterns: on corpus-based data, correlation strength decreases with model size (inverse scaling effect), whereas on synthetic data it increases (Quality-Power Hypothesis). We conclude that while surprisal can partially account for annotations of metaphor novelty, it remains a limited metric of linguistic creativity.",

First, we develop the general structure that equivariant maps $\\Phi:\\mathcal A \\to \\mathcal B$ between $C^\\ast$-algebras satisfy. Then, we undertake a systematic study of unital, Hermiticity-preserving maps that are equivariant under natural unitary group actions. Schwarz maps satisfy Kadison's inequality $\\Phi(X^\\ast X) \\geq \\Phi(X)^\\ast \\Phi(X)$ and form an intermediate class between positive and completely positive maps. We completely classify $U(n)$-equivariant on $M_n(\\mathbb C)$ and determine those that are completely positive and Schwarz. Partial classifications are then obtained for the weaker $DU(n)$-equivariance (diagonal unitary symmetry) and for tensor-product symmetries $U(n_1) \\otimes U(n_2)$. In each case, the parameter regions where $\\Phi$ is Schwarz or completely positive are described by explicit algebraic inequalities, and their geometry is illustrated. Finally, we further show that the $U(n)$-equivariant family satisfies $\\mathrm{PPT} \\iff \\mathrm{EB}$, while the $DU(2)$, symmetric $DU(3)$, $U(2) \\otimes U(2)$ and $U(2) \\otimes U(3)$, families obey the $\\mathrm{PPT}^2$ conjecture through a direct symmetry argument. These results reveal how group symmetry controls the structure of non-completely positive maps and provide new concrete examples where the $\\mathrm{PPT}^2$ property holds.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2501.19273v4 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Learning discrete distributions from i.i.d. samples is a well-understood problem. However, advances in generative machine learning prompt an interesting new, non-i.i.d. setting: after receiving a certain number of samples, an estimated distribution is fixed, and samples from this estimate are drawn and introduced into the sample corpus, undifferentiated from real samples. Subsequent generations of estimators now face contaminated environments, a scenario referred to in the machine learning literature as self-consumption. Empirically, it has been observed that models in fully synthetic self-consuming loops collapse -- their performance deteriorates with each batch of training -- but accumulating data has been shown to prevent complete degeneration. This, in turn, begs the question: What happens when fresh real samples \\textit{are} added at every stage? In this paper, we study the minimax loss of self-consuming discrete distribution estimation in such loops. We show that even when model collapse is consciously averted, the ratios between the minimax losses with and without source information can grow unbounded as the batch size increases. In the data accumulation setting, where all batches of samples are available for estimation, we provide minimax lower bounds and upper bounds that are order-optimal under mild conditions for the expected $\\ell_2^2$ and $\\ell_1$ losses at every stage. We provide conditions for regimes where there is a strict gap in the convergence rates compared to the corresponding oracle-assisted minimax loss where real and synthetic samples are differentiated, and provide examples where this gap is easily observed. We also provide a lower bound on the minimax loss in the data replacement setting, where only the latest batch of samples is available, and use it to find a lower bound for the worst-case loss for bounded estimate trajectories.",

This innovation is particularly valuable in indoor environments, in which signal propagation is severely degraded due to structural obstructions and complex multipath reflections. In this paper, we investigate the channel modeling and the joint optimization of antenna positioning, beamforming, and power allocation for indoor FAS. In particular, we propose a layout-specific channel model, and employ the novel group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm for tackling the optimization problem. Compared to the state-of-the-art Sionna model, our model achieves an 83.3% reduction in computation time with an approximately 3 dB increase in root-mean-square error (RMSE). When simplified to a two-ray model, our model allows for a closed-form antenna position solution with near-optimal performance. For the joint optimization problem, our GRPO algorithm outperforms proximal policy optimization (PPO) and other baselines in sum-rate, while requiring only 50.8% computational resources of PPO, thanks to its group advantage estimation. Simulation results show that increasing either the group size or trajectory length in GRPO does not yield significant improvements in sum-rate, suggesting that these parameters can be selected conservatively without sacrificing performance.",

In this paper, we investigate the large deviations asymptotics (governing sequences of exponentially small sets) for the isoperimetric problem on the product Riemannian manifold $M^{n}$ endowed with the product probability measure $\\nu^{\\otimes n}$, where $M$ is a Riemannian manifold satisfying $\\mathrm{CD}(0,\\infty)$. When the probability measure ${\\nu}$ admits a finite moment generating function for squared distance, we establish an exact characterization of the large deviations asymptotics of the isoperimetric profile, which reveals a precise equivalence between this asymptotic isoperimetry and an established strengthening of log-Sobolev inequality -- namely, nonlinear log-Sobolev inequality. It is observed that conditional typical sets, a fundamental concept from information theory, form an asymptotically optimal solution to the isoperimetric problem. This class of subsets further yields an upper bound on the isoperimetric profile in the central limit regime (concerning constant-volume sets), expressed as the Gaussian isoperimetric profile times the square root of spectral gap. Furthermore, we apply our results to establish quantitative relations among optimal constants in isoperimetric, concentration and transport inequalities, additionally covering isoperimetry for subexponentially and superexponentially small sets. Our results provide a rigorous justification from the perspective of nonlinear log-Sobolev inequalities for why isoperimetric minimizers behave fundamentally differently across spaces with distinct geometric structures. Our proof idea integrates tools from information theory, optimal transport, and geometric measure theory.",

AMP provides asymptotically optimal performance guarantees for large sparse recovery problems, which suggests its utility for QST. We discuss the design challenges that come with applying AMP to QST, and show that by properly designing the AMP algorithm, we can reduce the reconstruction error by over an order of magnitude compared to existing approaches to low-rank QST.

However, existing methods rely on multi-timestep training and reconfigurable computing architectures, which increases computational and memory overhead, thus reducing deployment efficiency. This work presents an efficient and lightweight residual SNN accelerator that combines algorithm and hardware co-design to optimize inference energy efficiency. In terms of the algorithm, we employ single-timesteps training, integrate grouped convolutions, and fuse batch normalization (BN) layers, thus compressing the network to only 0.69M parameters. Quantization-aware training (QAT) further constrains all parameters to 8-bit precision. In terms of hardware, the reuse of intra-layer resources maximizes FPGA utilization, a full pipeline cross-layer architecture improves throughput, and on-chip block RAM (BRAM) stores network parameters and intermediate results to improve memory efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed processor achieves a classification accuracy of 87.11% on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with an inference time of 3.98 ms per image and an energy efficiency of 183.5 FPS/W. Compared with mainstream graphics processing unit (GPU) platforms, it achieves more than double the energy efficiency.

We provide a formal description of the model, analyze its computational properties, and demonstrate empirically that CPSNNs learn long-gap temporal dependencies significantly faster and more reliably than standard SNN baselines.

This growing trend necessitates advanced benchmarks for the rigorous evaluation of optimization algorithms under realistic conditions. This paper introduces a comprehensive and principled framework for constructing highly realistic and challenging DMOO benchmarks. The proposed framework features several novel components: a generalized formulation that allows the Pareto-optimal Set (PS) to change on hypersurfaces, a mechanism for creating controlled variable contribution imbalances to generate heterogeneous landscapes, and dynamic rotation matrices for inducing time-varying variable interactions and non-separability. Furthermore, we incorporate a temporal perturbation mechanism to simulate irregular environmental changes and propose a generalized time-linkage mechanism that systematically embeds historical solution quality into future problems, thereby capturing critical real-world phenomena such as error accumulation and time-deception. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating its superiority over conventional benchmarks in terms of realism, complexity, and its capability for discriminating state-of-the-art algorithmic performance.

YO integrates three complementary mechanisms in a structured two-phase architecture: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for global exploration, greedy local search for exploitation, and simulated annealing with adaptive reheating to enable controlled escape from local minima. A dedicated burn-in phase allocates evaluations to probabilistic exploration, after which a hybrid optimization loop refines promising candidates. YO further incorporates a spatial blacklist mechanism to avoid repeated evaluation of poor regions and a multi-chain execution strategy to improve robustness and reduce sensitivity to initialization.\n  We evaluate YO on three benchmarks: the Rastrigin function (5D) with ablation studies, the Traveling Salesman Problem with 50 to 200 cities, and the Rosenbrock function (5D) with comparisons against established optimizers including CMA-ES, Bayesian optimization, and accelerated particle swarm optimization. Results show that MCMC exploration and greedy refinement are critical for solution quality, while simulated annealing and multi-chain execution primarily improve stability and variance reduction. Overall, YO achieves competitive performance on large and multimodal problems while maintaining predictable evaluation budgets, making it suitable for expensive black-box optimization settings.",

Specifically, multivariate chaotic mapping is first employed to improve the randomness and uniformity of the initial population. To further bolster population diversity and prevent the algorithm from stagnating in local optima, a bidirectional population evolutionary dynamics strategy is incorporated following the pursuit-and-evasion phase, thereby facilitating the attainment of the global optimal solution. Extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed multi-strategy NGO in WSN coverage. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing benchmarks in terms of both coverage enhancement and node connectivity.",

We report preliminary observations of non-Poissonian variability in inter-arrival time statistics during edge-of-stability operation, which we term the \"Silicon Heartbeat\" hypothesis. Theoretical analysis based on Hierarchical Number System (HNS) representations suggests that such architectures could achieve O(log n) energy scaling compared to traditional von Neumann O(2^n) dependencies.

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.01082v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Quality diversity (QD) optimization searches for a collection of solutions that optimize an objective while attaining diverse outputs of a user-specified, vector-valued measure function. Contemporary QD algorithms focus on low-dimensional measures because high-dimensional measures are prone to distortion, where many solutions found by the QD algorithm map to similar measures. For example, the CMA-MAE algorithm guides measure space exploration with a histogram in measure space that records so-called discount values. However, CMA-MAE stagnates in domains with high-dimensional measure spaces because solutions with similar measures fall into the same histogram cell and thus receive identical discount values. To address these limitations, we propose Discount Model Search (DMS), which guides exploration with a model that provides a smooth, continuous representation of discount values. In high-dimensional measure spaces, this model enables DMS to distinguish between solutions with similar measures and thus continue exploration. We show that DMS facilitates new QD applications by introducing two domains where the measure space is the high-dimensional space of images, which enables users to specify their desired measures by providing a dataset of images rather than hand-designing the measure function. Results in these domains and on high-dimensional benchmarks show that DMS outperforms CMA-MAE and other black-box QD algorithms.",

Although many deep learning methods have proven effective in learning time-series data for classification, they were originally developed under the assumption of balanced data distributions. Once data distribution is uneven, these methods tend to ignore the minority class that is typically of higher practical significance. Oversampling methods have been designed to address this by generating minority-class samples, but their reliance on linear interpolation often hampers the preservation of temporal dynamics and the generation of diverse samples. Therefore, in this paper, we propose Evo-TFS, a novel evolutionary oversampling method that integrates both time- and frequency-domain characteristics. In Evo-TFS, strongly typed genetic programming is employed to evolve diverse, high-quality time series, guided by a fitness function that incorporates both time-domain and frequency-domain characteristics. Experiments conducted on imbalanced time series datasets demonstrate that Evo-TFS outperforms existing oversampling methods, significantly enhancing the performance of time-domain and frequency-domain classifiers.",

For prescribed Dirichlet boundary function $\\mathcal{B}$, the transfinite interpolant of $\\mathcal{B}$, $g : \\bar P \\to C^0(\\bar P)$, $\\textit{lifts}$ functions from the boundary of a two-dimensional polygonal domain to its interior. The trial function is expressed as the difference between the neural network's output and the extension of its boundary restriction into the interior of the domain, with $g$ added to it. This ensures kinematic admissibility of the trial function in the deep Ritz method. Wachspress coordinates for an $n$-gon are used in the transfinite formula, which generalizes bilinear Coons transfinite interpolation on rectangles to convex polygons. The neural network trial function has a bounded Laplacian, thereby overcoming a limitation in a previous contribution where approximate distance functions were used to exactly enforce Dirichlet boundary conditions. For a point $\\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\bar{P}$, Wachspress coordinates, $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda} : \\bar P \\to [0,1]^n$, serve as a geometric feature map for the neural network: $\\boldsymbol{\\lambda}$ encodes the boundary edges of the polygonal domain.

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.01979v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Domain alignment refers broadly to learning correspondences between data distributions from distinct domains. In this work, we focus on a setting where domains share underlying structural patterns despite differences in their specific realizations. The task is particularly challenging in the absence of paired observations, which removes direct supervision across domains. We introduce a generative framework, called SerpentFlow (SharEd-structuRe decomPosition for gEnerative domaiN adapTation), for unpaired domain alignment. SerpentFlow decomposes data within a latent space into a shared component common to both domains and a domain-specific one. By isolating the shared structure and replacing the domain-specific component with stochastic noise, we construct synthetic training pairs between shared representations and target-domain samples, thereby enabling the use of conditional generative models that are traditionally restricted to paired settings. We apply this approach to super-resolution tasks, where the shared component naturally corresponds to low-frequency content while high-frequency details capture domain-specific variability. The cutoff frequency separating low- and high-frequency components is determined automatically using a classifier-based criterion, ensuring a data-driven and domain-adaptive decomposition. By generating pseudo-pairs that preserve low-frequency structures while injecting stochastic high-frequency realizations, we learn the conditional distribution of the target domain given the shared representation. We implement SerpentFlow using Flow Matching as the generative pipeline, although the framework is compatible with other conditional generative approaches. Experiments on synthetic images, physical process simulations, and a climate downscaling task demonstrate that the method effectively reconstructs high-frequency structures consistent with underlying low-frequency patterns, supporting shared-structure decomposition as an effective strategy for unpaired domain alignment.",

For both algorithms, the known runtime guarantees are linear in the population size; for the NSGA-II, matching lower bounds exist. With a careful study of the more complex selection mechanism of the SPEA2, we show that it has very different population dynamics. From these, we prove runtime guarantees for the OneMinMax, LeadingOnesTrailingZeros, and OneJumpZeroJump benchmarks that depend less on the population size. For example, we show that the SPEA2 with parent population size $\\mu \\ge n - 2k + 3$ and offspring population size $\\lambda$ computes the Pareto front of the OneJumpZeroJump benchmark with gap size $k$ in an expected number of $O( (\\lambda+\\mu)n + n^{k+1})$ function evaluations. This shows that the best runtime guarantee of $O(n^{k+1})$ is not only achieved for $\\mu = \\Theta(n)$ and $\\lambda = O(n)$ but for arbitrary $\\mu, \\lambda = O(n^k)$. Thus, choosing suitable parameters -- a key challenge in using heuristic algorithms -- is much easier for the SPEA2 than the NSGA-II.",

However, they face challenges regarding memory and computation overhead due to complex spatio-temporal dynamics and the necessity for multiple backpropagation computations across timesteps during training. To mitigate this overhead, compression techniques such as quantization are applied to SNNs. Yet, naively applying quantization to SNNs introduces a mismatch in membrane potential, a crucial factor for the firing of spikes, resulting in accuracy degradation. In this paper, we introduce Membrane-aware Distillation on quantized Spiking Neural Network (MD-SNN), which leverages membrane potential to mitigate discrepancies after weight, membrane potential, and batch normalization quantization. To our knowledge, this study represents the first application of membrane potential knowledge distillation in SNNs. We validate our approach on various datasets, including CIFAR10, CIFAR100, N-Caltech101, and TinyImageNet, demonstrating its effectiveness for both static and dynamic data scenarios. Furthermore, for hardware efficiency, we evaluate the MD-SNN with SpikeSim platform, finding that MD-SNNs achieve 14.85X lower energy-delay-area product (EDAP), 2.64X higher TOPS/W, and 6.19X higher TOPS/mm2 compared to floating point SNNs at iso-accuracy on N-Caltech101 dataset.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2512.23926v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Properties of ocular fixations and saccades are highly stochastic during many experimental tasks, and their statistics are often used as proxies for various aspects of cognition. Although distinguishing saccades from fixations is not trivial, experimentalists generally use common ad-hoc thresholds in detection algorithms. This neglects inter-task and inter-individual variability in oculomotor dynamics, and potentially biases the resulting statistics. In this article, we introduce and evaluate an adaptive method based on a Markovian approximation of eye-gaze dynamics, using saccades and fixations as states such that the optimal threshold minimizes state transitions. Applying this to three common threshold-based algorithms (velocity, angular velocity, and dispersion), we evaluate the overall accuracy against a multi-threshold benchmark as well as robustness to noise. We find that a velocity threshold achieves the highest baseline accuracy (90-93\\%) across both free-viewing and visual search tasks. However, velocity-based methods degrade rapidly under noise when thresholds remain fixed, with accuracy falling below 20% at high noise levels. Adaptive threshold optimization via K-ratio minimization substantially improves performance under noisy conditions for all algorithms. Adaptive dispersion thresholds demonstrate superior noise robustness, maintaining accuracy above 81% even at extreme noise levels ({\\sigma} = 50 px), though a precision-recall trade-off emerges that favors fixation detection at the expense of saccade identification. In addition to demonstrating our parsimonious adaptive thresholding method, these findings provide practical guidance for selecting and tuning classification algorithms based on data quality and analytical priorities.",

Other related and puzzling phenomena include properties of flat minima, saddle-to-saddle dynamics, and neuron alignment. To investigate these phenomena, we study the local geometry of deep ReLU neural networks. We show that, for a fixed architecture, as the weights vary, the image of a sample $X$ forms a set whose local dimension changes. The parameter space is partitioned into regions where this local dimension remains constant. The local dimension is invariant under the natural symmetries of ReLU networks (i.e., positive rescalings and neuron permutations). We establish then that the network's geometry induces a regularization, with the local dimension serving as a key measure of regularity. Moreover, we relate the local dimension to a new notion of flatness of minima and to saddle-to-saddle dynamics. For shallow networks, we also show that the local dimension is connected to the number of linear regions perceived by $X$, offering insight into the effects of regularization. This is further supported by experiments and linked to neuron alignment. Our analysis offers, for the first time, a simple and unified geometric explanation that applies to all learning contexts for these phenomena, which are usually studied in isolation. Finally, we explore the practical computation of the local dimension and present experiments on the MNIST dataset, which highlight geometry-induced regularization in this setting.",

Here, measures for calculating the smoothness and squintability properties of the PP index are defined. These are used to investigate the performance of a recently introduced swarm-based algorithm, Jellyfish Search Optimizer (JSO), for optimizing PP indexes. The performance of JSO in detecting the target pattern (pipe shape) is compared with existing optimizers in PP. Additionally, JSO's performance on detecting the sine-wave shape is evaluated using different PP indexes (hence different smoothness and squintability) across various data dimensions (d = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) and JSO hyper-parameters. We observe empirically that higher squintability improves the success rate of the PP index optimization, while smoothness has no significant effect.

However, existing merging techniques remain inadequate for this task. Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the curse of dimensionality, rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose Structural Importance Prior Bayesian Model Merging (SIP-BMM), a framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. SIP-BMM renders high-dimensional layer-wise search tractable by introducing an importance-aware Sparse Axis-Aligned Subspace Bayesian Optimization (SAASBO) strategy. By leveraging a structural importance prior derived from task-vector differences, our method guides SAASBO to automatically identify critical layers, thereby dramatically reducing the effective dimensionality without sacrificing the granularity of full-model control. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the Log-Noisy Expected Hypervolume Improvement ($q$NEHVI) acquisition function. Experiments demonstrate that SIP-BMM discovers a stronger and denser Pareto front than competitive baselines, enabling agile model selection tailored to diverse operational constraints.

Recent observations support engulfment as the cause of such signatures; however, many engulfment process details remain uncertain. Here, we present a model for determining the chemical signatures produced due to the pollution of main sequence stars by rocky planets, a common engulfment scenario due to the high frequency of observed short-period rocky exoplanets. A key novel element of our model is that we calculate the gradual evaporation of the planet due to drag interactions with the stellar envelope, which can lead to observable pollution on the stellar surface even if the bulk of the planet is only destroyed below the star's outer convective zone. Our results indicate that rocky planet pollution is most easily measurable for stars in the $1.0$ to $1.4$ M$_\\odot$ range and that elements such as aluminium, calcium, and vanadium, in addition to lithium, are most suited to detect pollution. We predict that it is also possible to differentiate between the engulfment of one large planet versus several small planets, for the same total pollution mass, for some stellar hosts. We find that rocky planet engulfment events generally take years to decades for most stars.

Additionally, several scenario-specific sub-models suited to different mission profiles are developed. Furthermore, the proposed model is verified in the orbit determination process.

We present Cycle 1 JWST/MIRI 11.4 {\\mu}m coronagraphic observations of three exoKuiper belts that exhibit gaps in their radial structures: HD 92945, HD 107146, and HD 206893, to determine whether planets are responsible for carving these structures, as seen in our Solar System with the gas giants. We reduce the JWST/MIRI data using spaceKLIP, and introduce new routines to mitigate the Brighter-Fatter effect and persistence. We do not detect any planet candidates, and all detected objects in the field-of-view are consistent with background stars or galaxies. However, by combining JWST mass limits, archival observational constraints, and astrometric accelerations, we rule out a significant portion of planet parameter space, placing tight constraints on the planets possibly responsible for these gaps. To interpret these results, we explore multiple gap-carving scenarios in discs, either massless or with non-zero mass, including clearing by in-situ planet(s), as well as shaping by inner planets through mean-motion or secular apsidal resonances.

To assess the planetary nature of the candidate, we performed a rigorous vetting process combining centroid analysis, Bayesian model comparison, and false-positive probability calculations. While the low signal-to-noise ratio of the sub-Earth candidate yielded inconclusive formal statistical validation metrics (FPP) and Bayesian evidence ($\\Delta \\ln Z$), we demonstrate the planetary nature of the system through physical exclusion of false positive scenarios. The TRICERATOPS Nearby False Positive Probability (NFPP) of 0.0000, combined with centroid stability, rules out background contamination. Furthermore, we calculate that a stellar-mass companion at the derived orbital separation ($a \\approx 5 R_\\star$) would induce ellipsoidal variations of order $\\gtrsim 5000$ ppm. The absence of such variations in the TESS photometry ($< 200$ ppm limit) physically precludes stellar binary scenarios.

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.01130v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This paper presents an adaptive multi-model framework for jointly estimating spacecraft attitude and star-tracker misalignments in GPS-denied deep-space CubeSat missions. A Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) estimates attitude, angular velocity, and gyro bias, while a Bayesian Multiple-Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE) layer operates on a discrete grid of body-to-sensor misalignment hypotheses. In the single-misalignment case, the MEKF processes gyroscope measurements and TRIAD-based attitude observations, and the MMAE updates a three-dimensional grid over the misalignment vector. For a dual-misalignment configuration, the same MEKF dynamics are retained, and the MMAE bank is driven directly by stacked line-of-sight measurements from two star trackers, forming a six-dimensional grid over the two misalignment quaternions without augmenting the continuous-state dimension. A novel diversity metric, $\\Psi$, is introduced to trigger adaptive refinement of the misalignment grid around a weighted-mean estimate, thereby preventing premature collapse of the model probabilities and concentrating computation in the most likely region of the parameter space. Monte Carlo simulations show arcsecond-level misalignment estimation and sub-degree attitude errors for both estimation problems, with estimation errors remaining well-bounded, proving robustness and consistency. These results indicate that the proposed MEKF--MMAE architecture enables accurate, autonomous, and computationally efficient in-flight calibration for resource-constrained spacecraft, and establishes dual star-tracker misalignment estimation as a practical option for deep-space CubeSat missions.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02296v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We identify and correct for small but coherent instrumental drifts in seven years of radial velocity data from the EXtreme PREcision Spectrograph (EXPRES). The systematics are most notable for the six months before and after 2022 January, when EXPRES experienced larger temperature variations, and we see a systematic trough-to-peak amplitude of 2.8 m/s in the radial velocities. This is large enough to mimic or obscure planetary signatures. To isolate and correct these effects, we develop a suite of diagnostics that track two-dimensional \\'echellogram shifts, scalings, and rotation, as well as line bisector spans (LBS) derived from laser frequency comb (LFC) lines. By combining these empirical tracers with instrument telemetry in a multi-dimensional regression, we reduce the EXPRES instrument trend traced with solar RVs from an RMS of 1.32 m/s to 0.43 m/s, a 67% improvement, and the aggregate of twelve chromospherically quiet stars show a 26% reduction in velocity scatter. Our injection-recovery simulations further demonstrate a doubling in sensitivity to low-amplitude planetary signals after correction. When applied to the stellar time series of $\\rho$ Coronae Borealis ($\\rho$CrB), the correction removes a spurious planet d signal, restoring the integrity of the data. These results highlight the need for long-term monitoring and multi-dimensional calibration diagnostics on the path toward true centimeter-per-second precision in next-generation EPRV instruments.",

While cometary comae have been studied thoroughly in the pertinent literature, cometary tails have remained less explored. Comparing these regions can reveal differences in the size, structure, and composition of their dust. The goal of this study is to examine the size, structure and composition of the dust particles in the coma and in particular in the tail of the bright comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) and to infer possible differences. For this purpose, we rely on the method of telescopic wide-field polarimetric imaging of the comet in the visible to near-infrared domain in order to obtain the dependence of the degree of linear polarization (DoLP) of the coma and tail on the phase angle across a broad range. An off-the-shelf industrial grade polarization camera was used in combination with a telescope of short aperture ratio. These observations are complemented by T-matrix and Discrete Dipole Approximation modeling using the MSTM5 and DDSCAT software framework, respectively, for simulation of light scattering by dust particles of fractal agglomerate and agglomerate debris morphology. Our observations indicate that the coma exhibits a high maximum DoLP of 0.34, which is further exceeded by a factor of about two by the DoLP of the comet's tail. Our modeling results suggest a 50:50 olivine-carbon composition. The fraction of agglomerate debris was found to be 50% in the coma and possibly higher in the tail. The differences between coma and tail in the observed maximum DoLP and the phase angle at which it occurs can be explained by a predominance of particles with radii larger than 0.6 micrometer in the coma vs. smaller sub-micrometer particles close to the Rayleigh limit in the tail [...]",

    "title": "Orbit dissimilarity criteria in meteor showers: a comparative review",
    "summary": "arXiv:2507.19075v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: In meteor science, the identification of meteor showers is a crucial and complex problem. The most common method is to perform a systematic search of a database of observed orbits using an orbit dissimilarity criterion (D-criterion) and an algorithm. D-criteria compare the result of an orbit dissimilarity function (D-function) and a threshold. These D-functions associate one value to two meteoroids orbits. If this value is lower than the threshold, the meteoroids' orbits are considered similar. Group of meteors are thus formed. However, not all D-criteria have been evaluated, and their high number makes it hard to know which should be prioritised. This paper presents a review of each D-function, the tests they passed, the threshold choice, and the algorithms they are used with. We show what methods are currently used in the search for meteor showers, presenting statistics based on papers justifying the existence of established meteor showers. We review D-functions from eight different papers. We describe how thresholds and clustering algorithms are usually chosen. We also analyse tests that were performed on D-criteria. We discover that most of those criteria were not properly tested, and that some have been criticised for their theoretical background. Thus, we recommend performing a post-search analysis of the groups found, both in a statistical sense (to make sure the groups formed could not have been formed randomly) and an orbital dynamics sense (to check whether the group could indeed come from a singular parent body), to present the findings as potential meteor showers.",

In this paper, we present a dynamical model of bank leverage (the ratio of asset holdings to equity) a quantity that both reflects and drives risk dynamics. We model how banks, constrained by Value-at-Risk (VaR) regulations, adjust their leverage in response to changes in the price of a single asset, assumed to be held in fixed proportion across banks. This leverage-targeting behavior introduces a procyclical feedback loop between asset prices and leverage. In the dynamics, this can manifest as logistic-like behavior with a rich bifurcation structure across model parameters. By analyzing these coupled dynamics in both isolated and interconnected bank models, we outline a framework for understanding how systemic risk can emerge from seemingly rational micro-level behavior.",

Each element is a LaSDI latent ODE surrogate trained from snapshots on a local patch, and neighboring elements are coupled through learned directional interaction terms in latent space, avoiding Schwarz iterations and interface residual evaluations. A smooth window-based blending reconstructs a global field from overlapping element predictions, yielding a scalable assembled latent dynamical system.

Whether or not a system returns to a given stable state after being perturbed away from it depends on the shape and extent of its basin of attraction. In this Letter, we show that basins of attraction in multiscale systems can exhibit special geometric properties in the form of universal singular funnels. We use the term singular basins to refer to basins of attraction with singular funnels. We show that singular basins occur robustly in a range of dynamical systems: the normal form of a pitchfork bifurcation with a slowly changing parameter, an adaptive active rotator, and an adaptive network of phase rotators. Although singular funnels are narrow, they can extend to different parts of the phase space and, unexpectedly, impact the resilience of the system to disturbances. Crucially, the presence of a singular funnel may prevent the usual dimensionality reductions in the limit of large timescale separation, such as quasi-static approximation, adiabatic elimination or time-averaging of the fast variables",

This is proven by first showing, via an order parameter bootstrapping argument, that the pathwise critical coupling strength is upper bounded by a function of the order parameter, and then showing by a volumetric argument that for Lebesgue almost every data the order parameter cannot stay below and be bounded away from 1 for all time; this is a Winfree model counterpart of the analysis of Ha and the author (2020) performed for the Kuramoto model. Using concentration of measure and the aforementioned volumetric argument, we show that, except possibly on a set of very small measure, oscillator death is observed in finite time; this rigorously demonstrates the existence of the oscillator death regime numerically observed by Ariaratnam and Strogatz (2001). These results are robust under many other choices of interaction functions often considered for the Winfree model. We demonstrate that the asymptotic dynamics described in this paper are sharp by analyzing the equilibria of the Winfree model, and we bound the total number of equilibria using a polynomial description.

We demonstrate that the maximum energy shapeability enables a systematic procedure for the IDA-PBC design by transforming the matching equation into a set of easier-to-solve PDEs. Sufficient conditions for maximum energy shapeability are also provided. It is shown that some existing constructive IDA-PBC designs actually implicitly exploit the maximum energy shapeability. The proposed procedure for the IDA-PBC design is illustrated with the magnetic levitation system.",

A quasi-static one-dimensional model of SFRJ with a variable geometry inlet is developed to compute thrust. An adaptive tracking controller is then designed using the DMAC framework, which leverages dynamic mode decomposition to approximate the local system behavior, followed by a tracking controller designed around the identified model. Simulation results demonstrate that DMAC achieves accurate thrust regulation across a range of commanded profiles and operating conditions, without requiring an analytical model of the SFRJ. These findings indicate that DMAC provides a reliable and effective approach for model-free thrust regulation in an SFRJ with variable-geometry inlets as the control input.",

Here we show that this view is incomplete. Using a stochastic model of allosteric regulation combined with an information-theoretic analysis, we quantify the mutual information between an enzyme's regulatory state and the states of downstream signaling components. Beyond controlling steady-state production levels, allostery also regulates the timing and duration over which information is transmitted. By tuning the temporal operating regime of signaling pathways, allosteric regulation enables distinct dynamical outcomes from identical molecular components, providing a physical mechanism for temporal information flow, signaling specificity, and coordination without changes in metabolic pathways.",

These systems are similar in being comprised of a large number of microscopic subsystems, each with complex nonlinear dynamics and interactions, that collectively give rise to different forms of macroscopic dynamics. Despite significant research, why and how various forms of macroscopic dynamics emerge from underlying micro-dynamics remains largely unknown. In this work we focus on linearity as one of the most fundamental aspects of system dynamics. By extending the theory of mixing sequences, we show that \\textit{in a broad class of autonomous nonlinear networked systems, the dynamics of the average of all subsystems' states becomes asymptotically linear as the number of subsystems grows to infinity, provided that, in addition to technical assumptions, pairwise correlations between subsystems decay to 0 as their pairwise distance grows to infinity}. We prove this result when the latter distance is between subsystems' linear indices or spatial locations, and provide extensions to linear time-invariant (LTI) limit dynamics, finite-sample analysis of rates of convergence, and networks of spatially-embedded subsystems with random locations. To our knowledge, this work is the first rigorous analysis of macroscopic linearity in large-scale heterogeneous networked dynamical systems, and provides a solid foundation for further theoretical and empirical analyses in various domains of science and engineering.",

The presence of such connecting orbits also reveals the unstable nature of those invariant measures appearing as their backward limits, a dynamical feature that has remained largely unexplored in stochastic equations. The framework applies to a wide range of classical models, including granular media equations in double-well and multi-well confining potentials with quadratic interaction, perturbed double-well landscapes, and interacting multi-species population models.

Phase-resolved analysis using a probabilistic segmentation method shows that this scaling arises from the fundamentally intermittent, two-dimensional, and directionally correlated nature of soaring transport, in which successive ballistic segments do not add coherently. We find that learning, in the sense of experience-driven improvements in exploration and decision-making, manifests primarily in the search phase, enhancing the ability to efficiently probe the air mass and locate the next thermal.

However, prior to absorption, the particle may undergo several rounds of surface attachment (adsorption), detachment (desorption) and diffusion. Alternatively, the surface may be stochastically gated so that absorption can only occur when the gate is open. In both cases one can view each return to the surface as a renewal event. In this paper we develop a renewal theory for stochastically gated FTP problems along analogous lines to previous work on adsorption/desorption processes. We proceed by constructing a renewal equation that relates the joint probability density for particle position and the state of a gate (or multiple gates) to the probability density and FPT density for a totally absorbing (non-gated) boundary. This essentially decomposes sample paths into an alternating sequence of bulk diffusion and instantaneous adsorption/desorption events, which is terminated when adsorption coincides with an open gate. Through a variety of examples, we show how renewal theory provides a general mathematical framework for incorporating stochastic gating into FTP problems.",

For vacancy-interstitial pairs, the log term of the direct Coulomb attraction and the elastic displacement energy cancel exactly at long distances, resulting in a defect energy of O(1). The numerical results confirm the predicted asymptotic behavior but also identify critical distances below which pairs evolve to different forms. We have found that bound pairs of dislocations - created by adding or removing 120 degree zig-zags of particles - have a dependence on their preparation history which is not accounted for in the usual starting point of the KTHNY theory. Furthermore, isolated dislocations, whose presence disrupts crystalline order, have energies of O(1) at some values of N, the number of particles in the system, and therefore will be thermally excited, raising questions about the applicability of standard KTHNY theory to the OCP, and supporting older suggestions that there are no phase transitions at all in the two-dimensional OCP.",

In order to analyze the TF-driven phase transition, we applied the longitudinal-field fidelity susceptibility $\\chi^{(h)}_F$, which is readily evaluated via the ED scheme. Here, the longitudinal field couples with the absolute value of the magnetic moment $|M|$ rather than the raw $M$ so that the remedied fidelity susceptibility exhibits a peak around the critical point; note that the spontaneous magnetization does not appear for the finite-size systems. As a preliminary survey, the modified fidelity susceptibility $\\chi^{(h)}_F$ is applied to the analysis of criticality for $J_2=0$, where a number of preceding results are available. Thereby, properly scaling the distance from the multi-criticality, $\\eta=0.5-J_2$, the $\\chi^{(h)}_F$ data were cast into the crossover-scaling formula, and the multi-critical exponent for $\\chi_F^{(h)}$ is estimated.

Using finite-size scaling and extreme value theory, we analyze the statistical properties of the cover time. Our results show power-law scaling with system size for the mean, variance, mode, and peak probability.

As a consequence of PHS, the topological phase transition point of a finite open chain coincides with that of the periodic (infinite) system. By explicitly constructing the zero-energy wave functions (Majorana modes), we show that Majorana modes necessarily occur as reciprocal localization pairs accumulating on opposite boundaries, whose combined probability density exhibits an exact cancellation of the non-Hermitian skin effect for the zero energy modes. Excited states, by contrast, generically display skin-effect localization, with particle and hole components accumulating at opposite ends of the system.

Achieving controllable stability and transitions between distinct topological structures is crucial for practical implementations. In this work, we investigate the effect of uniaxial mechanical strain on a magnetic model on the kagome lattice, focusing on skyrmion stability and emergent topological phases. To this end, we consider a Heisenberg model that includes exchange interactions and both in-plane and out-of-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Using a combination of Spin-Lattice Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations, we explore uniaxial strain variations in the range of $-10\\%$ to $10\\%$, showing important effects on the phase diagram. For compressive strain, we find that the density of skyrmions in the skyrmion gas (SkG) phase can be tuned and that the stability of this phase extends to higher temperatures. Tensile strain, in contrast, reduces the number of skyrmions and promotes transitions to other magnetic states. Within this regime, strain levels of about ($\\sim4-6\\%$) lead to a change in topological charge, turning skyrmions ($Q=-1$) into antiskyrmions ($Q=+1$). We also examine how strain affects other phases commonly appearing in skyrmion-hosting systems, such as the helical and fully polarized states, showing that mechanical deformation alters their stability and characteristic properties. Finally, we compare these results with the strain response of a more conventional skyrmion model, in order to clarify the role of the different interactions involved. Our results identify strain as an experimentally accessible route for engineering topological spin textures.",

Despite extensive empirical observations, it remains unclear which features of degenerate ground states are preferentially sampled and why by QA. Here we analyze the final states using degenerate perturbation theory to characterize the preference among them. In this analysis, the adjacency matrix of the graph composed by the ground states naturally emerges, and we can predict the eigenvector centralities (one of the node centralities) are related to the probabilities of these states. We verify this prediction on toy models where degeneracy is lifted at first and second order, and we show that second-order weights encode local barrier information, relating sampling fairness to the flatness of the local energy landscape. Finally, this perspective suggests two practical routes toward fair sampling -- promoting connectivity of the graph and reducing heterogeneity of centralities -- and we illustrate consistency with higher-order drivers and minor-embedding transformations.",

The family is indexed by the parameter $\\zeta \\in (0,1]$, which determines the range of the theory via the kinetic term constructed from the graph Laplacian raised to the power $\\zeta$. Specifically, $\\zeta=1$ is the short-range theory, while $0<\\zeta<1$ defines the long-range model. Due to the hyperbolic nature of Bethe lattices, the Laplacian lacks a zero mode and exhibits a spectral gap. We find that upon closing this spectral gap by a modification of the Laplacian, the scalar field theories exhibit novel critical behavior in the form of non-trivial fixed points with critical exponents governed by $\\zeta$ and the spectral dimension $d_s=3$. In particular, our analysis indicates the presence of a Wilson-Fisher fixed point for the short range $\\zeta =1$ theory. In contrast, the nearest-neighbor Ising model on the Bethe lattice is known to exhibit mean-field critical exponents.

This diversity, while indicative of the field's relevance, has inadvertently led to a fragmentation that hinders cohesive advances and their effective cross-community application to current problems for complex systems.

Recently, they have been established as a platform to study the nontrivial renormalization-group (RG) scenario of fixed-point annihilation, in which two intermediate-coupling RG fixed points collide and generate an extremely slow RG flow near the collision. For the Bose Kondo model, a single $S=1/2$ spin where each spin component couples to an independent bosonic bath with power-law spectrum $\\propto \\omega^s$ via dissipation strengths $\\alpha_i$, $i\\in\\{x,y,z\\}$, such phenomena occur sequentially for the U(1)-symmetric model at $\\alpha_z=0$ and the SU(2)-symmetric case at $\\alpha_z = \\alpha_{xy}$, as the bath exponent $s<1$ is tuned. Here we use an exact wormhole quantum Monte Carlo method for retarded interactions to explore how this nontrivial fixed-point structure affects the phase diagram and phase transitions of the anisotropic model. In particular, we show how fixed-point annihilation within a symmetry-enhanced critical manifold leads to (i) a continuous order-to-order transition beyond the Landau paradigm, (ii) a symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, and (iii) pseudocriticality, which can be tuned into each other via the bath exponent $s$. We extract critical exponents at the continuous transition, but also find scaling behavior at the symmetry-enhanced first-order transition, for which the inverse correlation-length exponent is given by the bath exponent $s$. Moreover, we provide direct numerical evidence for pseudocritical scaling on both sides of the fixed-point collision, which manifests in an extremely slow drift of the correlation-length exponent.

    "summary": "arXiv:2403.09314v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We study Onsager vortex clustered states in a shell-shaped superfluid containing a large number of quantum vortices. In the incompressible limit and at low temperatures, the relevant problem can be boiled down to the statistical mechanics of neutral point vortices confined on a sphere. We analyze rotation free vortex clustered states within the mean field theory in the microcanonical ensemble. We find that the sandwich state, which involves the separating of vortices with opposite circulation and the clustering of vortices with the same circulation around the poles and the equator, is the maximum entropy vortex distribution, subject to zero angular momentum constraint. The dipole momentum vanishes for the sandwich state and the quadrupole tensor serves as an order parameter to characterize the vortex cluster structure. For given finite angular momentum, the equilibrium vortex distribution forms a dipole structure, i.e., vortices with opposite sign are separated and are accumulated around the south and north pole, respectively. The conditions for the onset of clustering, and the exponents associated with the quadrupole moment and the dipole moment as functions of energy, are obtained within the mean field theory. At large energies,\n  we obtain asymptotically exact vortex density distributions using the stereographic projection method, giving rise to the parameter bounds for the vortex clustered states. The analytical predictions are in excellent agreement with microcanonical Monte Carlo simulations.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.11296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: One of the fundamental questions in population dynamics is how biological populations respond to environmental perturbations. In population dynamics, the mean fitness and the fraction of a trait in the steady state are important because they indicate how well the trait and the population adapt to the environment. In this study, we examine the parallel mutation-reproduction model, which is one of the simplest models of an evolvable population. As an extension of the Markov chain tree theorem, we derive diagrammatic expressions for the static responses of mean fitness and the steady-state distribution of the population. For the parallel mutation-reproduction model, we consider self-loops, which represent trait reproduction and are excluded from the Markov chain tree theorem for the linear master equation. To generalize the theorem, we introduce the concept of rooted $0$/$1$ loop forests, which generalize spanning trees with loops. We demonstrate that the weights of rooted $0$/$1$ loop forests yield the static responses of mean fitness and the steady-state distribution. Our results provide exact expressions for the static responses and the steady-state distribution. Additionally, we discuss approximations of these expressions in cases where reproduction or mutation is dominant. We provide numerical examples to illustrate these approximations and exact expressions.",

We calculate the anomalous dimensions of a large set of operators in any scalar $\\phi^4$ theory in $d=4-\\varepsilon$ dimensions, up to five loops in most cases. The results have applications in both effective field theory (EFT) and conformal field theory (CFT).

Additionally, for CFT, by resumming the $\\varepsilon$-expanded results at the fixed-point, we determine the entire low-lying spectrum (i.e. up to dimension six and Lorentz rank two) of the Ising, $O(n)$ and hypercubic scalar CFTs. Our work enables future conformal bootstrap studies for numerous theories of interest. We include introductions to EFT and CFT, and we illustrate our method and the structure in RG mixing matrices in several illuminating examples, which may also be of general interest.

Building on recent algorithmic advances that enable the stable calculation of EE as an exponential observable~\\cite{zhouIncremental2024,zhangIntegral2024,liaoExtracting2024}, we develop a {\\it bubble basis} projector quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to precisely and efficiently compute the universal corner of EE at QCPs in a (2+1)d square-lattice transverse-field Ising model augmented with a four-body interaction. Turning on this interaction allows us to trace an Ising critical line, reaching the tricritical point, and then a line of first-order phase transition. In (2+1)d, the tricritical point is described by the Gaussian theory, where a theoretical calculation of the corner logarithmic term in the 2nd R\\'enyi entropy term is available~\\cite{UniversalCasini2007}. Our QMC results are in quantitative agreement with this theoretical value, providing a highly nontrivial benchmark of the algorithm. Furthermore, we also study the R\\'enyi EE at the Ising critical line and on the first-order transition line, obtaining results consistent with theoretical expectations. These findings establish the long-sought connection between the universal values of an exactly solvable limit and those of a strongly correlated regime at (2+1)d.",

In this article, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative phase rigidity supercurrents, a mapping we confirm empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity. Generalizing this framework to three dimensions ($S^1\\to S^2$), we show that polar alignment on the unit sphere is geometrically equivalent to the Gilbert damping term in spintronics, and that the two-dimensional Kuramoto coupling term naturally appears in the tangent-plane projection of spin relaxation. This constraint generates inertial spin waves (ferromagnetic magnons) from the overdamped active bath, recovering the macroscopic transport predicted by Toner-Tu theory without invoking microscopic inertia. Our results show that all polar chiral agents who seek to align on the unit sphere strictly constitute a dissipative spintronic fluid, where phase gradient transport is ensured by the Goldstone modes of the underlying broken symmetry.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.01497v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: R\\'enyi transfer entropy (RTE) is a generalization of classical transfer entropy that replaces Shannon's entropy with R\\'enyi's information measure. This, in turn, introduces a new tunable parameter $\\alpha$, which accounts for sensitivity to low- or high-probability events. Although RTE shows strong potential for analyzing causal relations in complex, non-Gaussian systems, its practical use is limited, primarily due to challenges related to its accurate estimation and interpretation. These difficulties are especially pronounced when working with finite, high-dimensional, or heterogeneous datasets. In this paper, we systematically study the performance of a k-nearest neighbor estimator for both R\\'enyi entropy (RE) and RTE using various synthetic data sets with clear cause-and-effect relationships inherent to their construction. We test the estimator across a broad range of parameters, including sample size, dimensionality, memory length, and R\\'enyi order $\\alpha$. In particular, we apply the estimator to a set of simulated processes with increasing structural complexity, ranging from linear dynamics to nonlinear systems with multi-source couplings. To address interpretational challenges arising from potentially negative RE and RTE values, we introduce three reliability conditions and formulate practical guidelines for tuning the estimator parameters. We show that when the reliability conditions are met and the parameters are calibrated accordingly, the resulting effective RTE estimates accurately capture directional information flow across a broad range of scenarios. Results obtained show that the explanatory power of RTE depends sensitively on the choice of the R\\'{e}nyi parameter $\\alpha$. This highlights the usefulness of the RTE framework for identifying the drivers of extreme behavior in complex systems.",

This apparent equilibrium is shown in this work to correspond to a fixed point solution of the Navier-Stokes equations expressed in the statistical state dynamics (SSD) framework. Moreover, this fixed point solution is found to be rank-three, consisting of one analytically identified roll-streak structure (RSS) constituting the first cumulant of the SSD, and two analytically determined eigenmodes supporting the second cumulant. This minimal representation captures both the structure and the dynamics of WCC turbulence, while the remaining spectral components contribute negligibly to the equilibrium dynamics. Turbulent Couette flows other than WCC can be understood to be limit cycle and chaotic extensions supported by the same underlying mechanism as the fixed point WCC turbulence except for the two eigenmodes supporting WCC turbulence being replaced by two Floquet modes and two Lyapunov vectors, respectively.

However, existing computational methods often rely on single biological networks or population-level mutation patterns, limiting their ability to identify patient-specific drivers and leverage the complementary information from multiple network types. Here, we present HyperNetWalk, a novel computational framework that integrates multiple biological networks and hypergraph diffusion to identify driver genes at both personalized and cohort levels. In the first stage, HyperNetWalk integrates protein-protein interaction networks, gene regulatory networks, and dynamic co-expression networks through sample-independent random walks on patient-specific subnetworks to capture topological importance and expression perturbation effects. In the second stage, it refines predictions through hypergraph-based random walks that leverage cross-sample information while preserving individual mutational contexts. Comprehensive evaluation on 12 TCGA cancer types demonstrates that HyperNetWalk achieves superior or competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both personalized and cohort-level predictions. Notably, HyperNetWalk successfully identifies known driver genes with high precision while revealing cancer type-specific drivers that reflect distinct biological mechanisms.

    "summary": "Optical photothermal infrared (O-PTIR) microspectroscopy is an emerging label-free technique that achieves infrared super-resolution and has found widespread applications, primarily in soft materials. While the photothermal effect underlying O-PTIR has been extensively studied at room temperature, there was an open question whether the signal itself would benefit from a lower temperature, as the photoinduced heating could be more localized, thus increasing the signal. In this work, we integrated a temperature-controlled stage into an O-PTIR microscope, enabling the first spectroscopic measurements and imaging of samples at subzero temperatures down to -100 \u00b0C. Using tristearin, biological tissue, and polymer samples, we demonstrated that cooling significantly enhances the O-PTIR signal up to three times, with a maximum observed in the -20 to -40 \u00b0C range. This enhancement leads to an improved analytical sensitivity, reducing the limit of detection for a thin protein film from ca. 400 nm to ca. 300 nm. We further discuss the underlying physical mechanism with theoretical modeling, including thermal conductivity and heat dissipation effects, that contribute to the observed temperature-dependent signal amplification. Overall, this study establishes temperature-controlled O-PTIR as a powerful new approach for high-sensitivity, high-resolution infrared analysis, thereby expanding its applicability to a broader range of materials and experimental conditions.",

Docking studies were performed on the deacetylated (active) form of the ligand, revealing favorable binding to \u03bc-opioid receptor residues critical for activation, including hydrophobic contacts with TRP242, ILE245, VAL249, and key hydrogen bonds and a stabilizing salt bridge with HIS246 [1,2]. Interaction profiling against a voltage-gated calcium channel (8IF3) showed multiple hydrophobic and hydrogen-bond contacts, suggesting potential dual-target engagement [3,4]. Physicochemical and ADMET analysis identified limited lipophilicity, raising concerns for blood\u2013brain barrier penetration [5]. To address this, a prodrug approach via selective acetylation of hydroxyl groups is proposed to enhance CNS penetration; enzymatic hydrolysis in situ is expected to release the active, deacetylated ligand capable of receptor engagement [5,6]. These results establish a foundation for further computational and experimental studies toward multifunctional analgesic agents [1,2,3].",

The core of the proposed methodology is the generation of a novel dataset using specially designed body force fields with compact support (BFCS), enabling a new RVE concept that reduces the infinite periodic medium to a finite domain without boundary artifacts. This functionally reduced RVE is used for translated averaging of direct numerical simulations (DNS) results, efficiently computed via a newly developed FFT-based solver for BFCS loading. The resulting dataset captures localized field responses and is used to train machine learning (ML) and neural networks (NN) models to learn effective nonlocal surrogate operators. These operators accurately predict macroscopic responses while reflecting microstructural features and nonlocal interactions. By accounting for field localization while simultaneously eliminating influences from finite sample size and boundary effects, it provides a physically grounded and data-driven framework for constructing accurate surrogate models for the homogenization of complex materials.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.01185v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Machine-learning potentials (MLIPs) have been a breakthrough for computational physics in bringing the accuracy of quantum mechanics to atomistic modeling. To achieve near-quantum accuracy, it is necessary that neighborhoods contained in the training set are rather close to the ones encountered during a simulation. Yet, constructing a single training set that works well for all applications is, and likely will remain, infeasible, so, one strategy is to supplement training protocols for MLIPs with additional learning methods, such as active learning, or fine-tuning. This strategy, however, yields very complex training protocols that are difficult to implement efficiently, and cumbersome to interpret, analyze, and reproduce.\n  To address the above difficulties, we propose AutoPot, a software for automating the construction and archiving of MLIPs. AutoPot is based on BlackDynamite, a software operating parametric tasks, e.g., running simulations, or single-point ab initio calculations, in a highly-parallelized fashion, and Motoko, an event-based workflow manager for orchestrating interactions between the tasks. The initial version of AutoPot supports selection of training configurations from large training candidate sets, and on-the-fly selection from molecular dynamics simulations, using Moment Tensor Potentials as implemented in MLIP-2, and single-point calculations of the selected training configurations using VASP. Another strength of AutoPot is its flexibility: BlackDynamite tasks and orchestrators are Python functions to which own existing code can be easily added and manipulated without writing complex parsers. Therefore, it will be straightforward to add other MLIP and ab initio codes, and manipulate the Motoko orchestrators to implement other training protocols.",

Neural operator learning has recently emerged as a promising approach to approximate dynamical generators from data, yet stiffness imposes severe obstacles: training errors concentrate on slow manifold states, collapse of fast dynamics occurs, and the learned operator may fail to reproduce the true eigenstructure.\n  We demonstrate three key advances enabling accurate learning of stiff operators and preserving spectral fidelity: (i) stiffness aware scaling of time derivatives, (ii) fast direction excitation via local trajectory cloud bursts, and (iii) autograd-based Jacobian diagnostics ensuring eigenstructure fidelity. Applied to the Davis-Skodje system, the approach recovers both slow and fast modes across stiffness regimes, reducing fast eigenvalue error by an order of magnitude while improving rollout fidelity.

This paper presents LLMize, an open-source Python framework that enables LLM-driven optimization through iterative prompting and in-context learning. LLMize formulates optimization as a black-box process in which candidate solutions are generated in natural language, evaluated by an external objective function, and refined over successive iterations using solution-score feedback. The framework supports multiple optimization strategies, including Optimization by Prompting (OPRO) and hybrid LLM-based methods inspired by evolutionary algorithms and simulated annealing. A key advantage of LLMize is the ability to inject constraints, rules, and domain knowledge directly through natural language descriptions, allowing practitioners to define complex optimization problems without requiring expertise in mathematical programming or metaheuristic design. LLMize is evaluated on convex optimization, linear programming, the Traveling Salesman Problem, neural network hyperparameter tuning, and nuclear fuel lattice optimization. Results show that while LLM-based optimization is not competitive with classical solvers for simple problems, it provides a practical and accessible approach for complex, domain-specific tasks where constraints and heuristics are difficult to formalize.",

Pressure is a powerful method that can switch a three-dimensional (3D) material between non-superconducting and superconducting states. In the two-dimensional (2D) case, strain engineering plays a similar role to pressure. However, purely strain-induced superconductivity in 2D systems remains exceedingly scarce. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that a superconducting transition can be induced solely by applying biaxial tensile strain in a 2D carbon allotrope, THO-graphene, which is composed of triangles, hexagons, and octagons. Free-standing THO-graphene is non-superconducting. Surprisingly, the electron-phonon coupling in strained THO-graphene is enhanced strong enough to pair electrons and realize superconductivity, with the highest superconducting transition temperature reaching 45 K. This work not only provides a notable example of controlling metal-superconductor transition in 2D system just via strain, but also sets a new record of superconducting transition temperature for 2D elemental superconductors.",

While optical neural networks offer an alternative, their capabilities remain constrained by the lack of efficient optical nonlinearities. To address this, we propose an all-optical deep learning architecture by embedding quantum emitters in inverse-designed nanophotonic structures. Due to their saturability, quantum emitters exhibit exceptionally strong nonlinearity compared with conventional materials. Using physics-aware training, we demonstrate that the proposed architecture can solve complex tasks, including nonlinear classification and reinforcement learning, which have not been realized in all-optical neural networks. To enable fair comparison across different platforms, we introduce a framework that quantitatively links nonlinearity to a network's expressive power. Analysis shows that our quantum activation, operating below nW/{\\mu}m^2 intensity, reduces the power budget by seven orders of magnitude. System-level estimates show that the optical power required for large language models scales sublinearly with model size, enabling watt-level operation.

This study considers a data-driven approach to model droplet dynamics with the thickness of liquid films on the nanometer-micrometer scale in a compact form of a partial differential equation. We examine spatiotemporal film-thickness profiles resolved at the nanometer scale via phase-shifting imaging ellipsometry. For a pure solvent, the present governing equation recovers the classical lubrication physics driven by disjoining pressure and evaporation. In contrast, the nanofluid dynamics necessitates a unique transport term scaling with the gradient of the inverse film thickness. Theoretical analysis suggests this term represents a nanoparticle-induced bias flux, consistent with a hypothesized capillary wicking mechanism within the precursor film. The identification of the current nanofluid-specific term underscores the efficacy of integrating high-precision experimental measurements with data-driven modeling to unravel complex wetting dynamics.",

However, such high-dimensional dynamic PDE-constrained optimization problems are extremely challenging or even intractable. It has been recently shown that inverse problems can be solved by only considering certain robust features. Here we consider the ICF capsule's deuterium-tritium (DT) interface, and construct a causal, dynamic, multifidelity reduced-order surrogate that maps from a time-dependent radiation temperature drive to the interface's radius and velocity dynamics. The surrogate targets an ODE embedding of DT interface dynamics, and is constructed by learning a controller for a base analytical model using low- and high-fidelity simulation training data with respect to radiation energy group structure. After demonstrating excellent accuracy of the surrogate interface model, we use machine learning (ML) models with surrogate-generated data to solve inverse problems optimizing radiation temperature drive to reproduce observed interface dynamics. For sparse snapshots in time, the ML model further characterizes the most informative times at which to sample dynamics. Altogether we demonstrate how operator learning, causal architectures, and physical inductive bias can be integrated to accelerate discovery, design, and diagnostics in high-energy-density systems.",

The proposed sensor leverages the synergy between SPR and PCF technologies to overcome the bulkiness and limited sensitivity of traditional SPR systems. A thin gold (Au) layer, responsible for plasmon excitation, is deposited on the fiber structure, while a nanolayer of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is introduced to enhance adhesion between the gold and the silica background, improving structural stability and field confinement. The sensor is designed to detect refractive index (RI) variations in biological analytes, specifically targeting cancerous cells from skin, blood, and adrenal gland tissues. The optical characteristics and performance of the sensor were thoroughly analyzed using the Finite Element Method (FEM) in COMSOL Multiphysics 6.1, allowing for precise simulation and optimization.

As a prototype conducting X-type antiferromagnet, the Fermi surface of $\\beta-\\mathrm{Fe}_2\\mathrm{PO}_5$ exhibits a distinct $d$-wave altermagnetic characteristic, which compresses into a nearly X-shaped configuration. This results in highly efficient spin currents, achieving a charge-spin conversion efficiency of up to 90%. Moreover, the spin current polarization is controlled by the orientation of the N\\'eel vector. When the N\\'eel vector tilts to the out-of-plane direction, an in-plane injected charge current can generate a special spin current component with both spin polarization and propagation along the out-of-plane direction, whose charge-spin conversion efficiency substantially exceeds that of known ferromagnets, altermagnets, noncollinear antiferromagnets, and low-symmetry materials.

Unlike the traditional Fourier paradigm, it makes decomposition of a signal possible without any predefined function basis, which gives unprecedented flexibilities while handling narrow-banded signals of varieties. However, determining the number and central frequencies of intrinsic mode functions are still open questions in that few studies has been proposed to give a complete method that can theoretically guarantee the global convergence during decomposition. In this article, we propose a globally convergent numerical optimization method based on variational convex optimization to automatically determine the number and central frequency of IMFs without any prior knowledge for narrow banded signals, as long as the spectra of each sub-band are identifiable. Our method focuses on finding the support baseline of the spectral function, and further separating the significant frequency band regions above the support baseline. Unlike pioneer works that focus on optimizations on complex field, our method achieves obtaining the number of decomposed IMFs and center frequencies in real field by combining variational calculus, convex optimization, and numerical solutions of differential equations in real field and theoretical analysis shows our algorithm is guaranteed terminate to one of the optimum as close as possible. Experiments also shows that our algorithm converges quickly and can be used in practical engineering to determine the prior information of the number of intrinsic modes and evaluate initial center frequency as prior information to continue the VMD procedure.",

In the twisted cotangent bundle $(T^*M,\\omega_\\varepsilon)$, with $\\omega_\\varepsilon=\\omega_{\\mathrm{can}}+\\varepsilon\\,\\pi^*\\omega_{\\mathrm{KKS}}$ being the canonical plus Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau (KKS) forms, we build two canonical and commuting families of polynomial first integrals: one pulled back from the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$ via the magnetic moment map $P$, and one pulled back from a $\\mathrm{Ad}(A)$-invariant affine slice of $\\mathfrak{m} \\cong T_{eA}M$, where $eA$ is the identity of $G/A$. Their common image generates a reduced Poisson algebra obtained from a fiber tensor product, and the natural multiplication map into a Poisson subalgebra of polynomial functions $\\mathcal{O}(T^*M) \\subset C^\\infty(T^*M)$ is Poisson and injective. The center of this fiber tensor product is contained in the Poisson center of the symmetric algebra of $\\mathfrak{g}$.

We further probe the origin of these results from the viewpoint of integrability, which is taken here to mean wider classes of recursions and differential equations, and give extensions.

For all feasible initial discontinuous conditions, we delineate a classification of wave structures during the evolutionary process by virtue of the initial distribution of Riemann invariants, including both convex and non-convex cases. In this classification, we find that the evolved wave structures in non-convex cases incorporate an additional and more complex region-contact DSW region, compared with those in convex cases. So we analyze the propagation behavior of this region. Additionally, we also take into account the problem that the initial wave at the instant of wave breaking approximated by the cubic root function, and elaborately analyze the propagation of photons in optical fibers under the effects of high-order dispersion and quintic nonlinearity.",

Here, various non-local interactions are considered, and two features reported. Firstly, it is shown that sufficiently non-local interactions will regulate ultra-violet divergences that perturbative methods with local interactions produce. However, in asymptotic regimes, infra-red divergences persist and ultra-violet divergences can reappear. Renormalisation methods are shown to report the same universal behaviour as local interactions at critical points. Secondly, the renormalisation group can be interpreted as a space-time-field rescaling that preserves action structure. This can be used to extract solutions to Callan-Symanzik equations directly without having to solve (or construct) the equation. These observations are exemplified for two paradigm models; annihilation $A_p+A_q\\rightarrow \\phi$, and this process paired with branching, birth and death.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02169v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We consider here several aspects of the following challenging question: is it possible to use a passive cloak to make invisible a dielectric inclusion on a finite frequency interval in the quasistatic regime of Maxwell's equations for an observer close to the object? In this work, by considering the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map, we not only answer negatively this question, but we go further and provide some quantitative bounds on this map that provide fundamental limits to both cloaking as well as approximate cloaking. These bounds involve the following physical parameters: the length and center of the frequency interval, the volume of the cloaking device, the volume of the obstacle, and the relative permittivity of the object. Our approach is based on two key tools: i) variational principles from the abstract theory of composites and ii) the analytic approach to deriving bounds from sum rules for passive systems. To use i), we prove a new representation theorem for the DtN map which allows us to interpret this map as an effective operator in the abstract theory of composites. One important consequence of this representation is that it allows one to incorporate the broad and deep results from the theory of composites, such as variational principles, and to apply the bounds derived from them to the DtN map. These results could be useful in other contexts other than cloaking. Next, to use ii), we show that the passivity assumption allows us to connect the DtN map (as function of the frequency) with two important classes of analytic functions, namely, Herglotz and Stieltjes functions. The sum rules for these functions, combined with the variational approach, allows us to derive new inequalities on the DtN map which impose fundamental limitations on passive cloaking, both exact and approximate, over a frequency interval. We consider both cases of lossy and lossless cloaks.",

Using only this identity and elementary order-theoretic arguments -- requiring no spectral decomposition or dimension-dependent techniques -- we prove that in any finite composition-closed family of positive subunital maps, defects are eventually annihilated under iteration (Theorem 4.1), with an explicit bound linear in the family size. Under a persistence hypothesis (nonzero positive elements map to nonzero positive elements), we establish that all maps in such families must be unital. For completely positive maps on finite-dimensional matrix algebras, we then prove a sharp dimension-dependent bound: the stabilization index satisfies $n_T \\le d$ where $d$ is the Hilbert space dimension, independent of the family size. This bound is achieved by a shift channel construction.

Linearizing the field equations around this background, we derive the Klein Gordon equation for the curvature perturbation and show that the scalar propagating mode acquires a mass, highlighting how the same scalar degree of freedom governs inflationary dynamics at high curvature and the propagation of gravitational waves in the current accelerating Universe. Using the scalar vector tensor (SVT) decomposition and a decomposition of the perturbed Ricci tensor, we obtain a set of fully gauge invariant propagation equations that isolate the contributions of the scalar, vector, and tensor modes in the presence of matter. We find that the tensor sector retains the two transverse traceless polarizations of General Relativity, while the scalar sector supports a massive breathing-longitudinal mode determined by the massive scalar propagating mode. Through the geodesic deviation equation, computed both in a local Minkowski patch and in fully covariant de Sitter form, we independently recover the same polarization content and identify its tidal signatures. The resulting framework connects the extra scalar polarization to cosmological observables, providing a unified, gauge invariant link between gravitational wave phenomenology and the cosmological implications of metric f(R) gravity.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.01307v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Quantum steering is one of the most intriguing phenomena in quantum mechanics and is essential for understanding correlations in multi-body systems. Despite its importance, analytical results for coupled three-body oscillators remain scarce. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon through a geometrical diagonalization approach, which reduces the degrees of freedom associated with the system's steering properties. Specifically, we derive analytical expressions for quantum steering in all possible directions using the Wigner function framework, as it provides a complete description of the system's quantum state. Our results indicate that excitations significantly enhance quantum steering across the system; this stands in contrast to the ground state $(0,0,0)$, which exhibits no steerable correlations. Furthermore, both the directionality and topology of these correlations are governed by the spatial distribution of the excitations rather than their magnitude. We also observe symmetric steering behavior between oscillators $x$, $y$, and $z$ under equivalent excitation conditions, which can be formalized as $S^{(n,m,l)}_{x\\to z}(\\theta)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{x\\to y}(-\\theta),\\quad S^{(n,m,l)}_{z\\to x}(\\theta)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{y\\to x}(-\\theta)$, and $S^{(n,m,l)}_{y\\to z}(\\theta)=S^{(n,m,l)}_{z\\to y}(-\\theta)$.

In addition, to obtain the general solution of the model, the IHJM have also solved the inverse problem of calculus of variation (IPCV) without resorting to Helmholtz conditions and whether the necessary conditions for the existence of the Lagrangian function are hold or not. The main part of the IHJM is to find the generating function of the canonical transformation (CT) and then extract two independent invariants for the desired model by using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE). This study shows that there is a close relationship between the group of the CTs of the Hamiltonian function of the particle and the one-parameter Lie group of transformations keeping invariant the Einstein-Friedmann dynamical equation (EFDE) \\(\\ddot{a}=F(a,\\dot{a})\\), so that both of them lead to the same result.

Applied to the Davis-Skodje system, the approach recovers both slow and fast modes across stiffness regimes, reducing fast eigenvalue error by an order of magnitude while improving rollout fidelity.

In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon from a function-class perspective. We show that sufficiently expressive, unstructured variational ansatze enter a Haar-like universality class in which both observable expectation values and parameter gradients concentrate exponentially with system size. As a consequence, the hypothesis class induced by such circuits collapses with high probability to a narrow family of near-constant functions, a phenomenon we term simplicity bias, with barren plateaus arising as a consequence rather than the root cause. Using tools from random matrix theory and concentration of measure, we rigorously characterize this universality class and establish uniform hypothesis-class collapse over finite datasets. We further show that this collapse is not unavoidable: tensor-structured VQCs, including tensor-network-based and tensor-hypernetwork parameterizations, lie outside the Haar-like universality class. By restricting the accessible unitary ensemble through bounded tensor rank or bond dimension, these architectures prevent concentration of measure, preserve output variability for local observables, and retain non-degenerate gradient signals even in over-parameterized regimes. Together, our results unify barren plateaus, expressivity limits, and generalization collapse under a single structural mechanism rooted in random-matrix universality, highlighting the central role of architectural inductive bias in variational quantum algorithms.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02001v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Real-world complex systems often evolve on different timescales and possess multiple coexisting stable states. Whether or not a system returns to a given stable state after being perturbed away from it depends on the shape and extent of its basin of attraction. In this Letter, we show that basins of attraction in multiscale systems can exhibit special geometric properties in the form of universal singular funnels. We use the term singular basins to refer to basins of attraction with singular funnels. We show that singular basins occur robustly in a range of dynamical systems: the normal form of a pitchfork bifurcation with a slowly changing parameter, an adaptive active rotator, and an adaptive network of phase rotators. Although singular funnels are narrow, they can extend to different parts of the phase space and, unexpectedly, impact the resilience of the system to disturbances. Crucially, the presence of a singular funnel may prevent the usual dimensionality reductions in the limit of large timescale separation, such as quasi-static approximation, adiabatic elimination or time-averaging of the fast variables",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02187v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We develop a fractional-order Ginzburg-Landau (GL) framework for nonreciprocal superconducting transport in Josephson junctions formed by fractal superconductors or superconducting media with nonlocal correlations, separated by a noncentrosymmetric normal layer. We show that nonreciprocity and the superconducting diode effect arise from the interplay between the Lifshitz invariant and fractional kinetics, with the latter serving as an effective, symmetry-consistent representation of fractal geometry and finite-range memory. Two complementary approaches are pursued. In a fractional integral GL formulation, spatial integration on a fractal space yields analytic solutions and reveals how rectification scales with the dimensionality of the fractal media and the strength of the Lifshitz-like drift. In a fractional derivative-based formulation derived via the Agrawal variational principle with left/right Caputo operators, we obtain a gauge-invariant free energy, the corresponding GL equations, and a current density. We use fractional orders as effective parameters that represent nonlocal and memory effects induced by fractal microstructure. Within a two-mode plane-wave approximation we derive a compact current-phase relation and an expression for the diode efficiency, and we map the rectification amplitude across the fractional kinetic and the Lifshitz/memory order. An exact single-sided solution in terms of Prabhakar functions further confirms robust, tunable nonreciprocity, including a near-ideal diode response. This identifies a pathway to near-perfect superconducting diodes by engineering fractal (fractional-kinetic) transport achieved by tuning the fractional orders and Lifshitz strength without invoking magnetic fields or geometric ratchets. In the integer limit of local kinetics and Lifshitz-like drift, both constructions reduce to the standard $\\varphi_0$ Josephson junction.",

As a corollary, for the almost-Mathieu operator in the supercritical regime the \"all spectral gaps are open\" property is robust under a small trigonometric-polynomial perturbation at any irrational frequency. The proof introduces a geometric, all-frequency approach built from three ingredients: (i) the projective action on the Lagrangian Grassmannian and an associated fibred rotation number, (ii) monotonicity of one-parameter families of (Hermitian) symplectic cocycles, and (iii) a partially hyperbolic splitting with a two-dimensional center together with a global symplectification (holonomy-driven parallel transport).

Although this framework has been highly successful in characterizing macroscopic fluctuations and correlations, a systematic derivation of fluctuating hydrodynamics from underlying stochastic microscopic dynamics remains obscure for broad classes of interacting systems. For stochastic lattice gas models with gradient dynamics and a single conserved density, we develop a path-integral based coarse-graining procedure that recovers fluctuating hydrodynamics in a controlled manner. Our analysis highlights the essential role of local-equilibrium averages, which go beyond na\\\"ive mean-field-type gradient expansions. We further extend this approach to interacting Brownian particles by coarse-graining the Dean-Kawasaki equation, revealing a mobility proportional to the density and a diffusivity determined by the thermodynamic pressure.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02326v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We are interested in how regular a transport velocity field must be in order to control Riesz-type commutators. Estimates for these commutators play a central role in the analysis of the mean-field limit and fluctuations for systems of particles with pairwise Riesz interactions, which we start by reviewing. Our first new result shows that the usual $L^\\infty$ assumption on the gradient of the velocity field cannot, in general, be relaxed to a BMO assumption. We construct counterexamples in all dimensions and all Riesz singularities $-2< s<d$, except for the one-dimensional logarithmic endpoint $s=0$. At this exceptional endpoint, such a relaxation is possible, a fact related to the classical Coifman-Rochberg-Weiss commutator bound for the Hilbert transform. Our second result identifies a trade-off between the singularity of the interaction potential and the required regularity of the velocity field. Roughly speaking, smoother (less singular) interactions require stronger velocity control if one wants a commutator estimate in the natural energy seminorm determined by the potential. We formulate this principle for a broad class of potentials and show that, in the sub-Coulomb Riesz regime, the velocity regularity appearing in the known commutator inequality is sharp. Despite these negative findings, we show as our third result that a defective commutator estimate holds for almost-Lipschitz transport fields. Such a defective estimate, which is a consequence of the celebrated Brezis-Wainger-Hansson inequality, allows us to prove rates of convergence when the mean-field density belongs to the scaling-critical Sobolev space.",

We proceeded from Dyson's time-ordered solutions, and using only generalizations of the well-known Baker-Campbell- Hausdorff (BCH) and Zassenhaus formulae for $t$-dependent operators directly converted them to simple proper operator exponents. The method being explicit both in terms of the operator and in terms of expressing the formal solution as an ordinary exponential, makes it quite easy to calculate analytical expressions to solutions in the form of a Taylor function series in one variable $t$.

The central object describing these properties is the quantum geometric tensor, which unifies the Berry curvature and the quantum metric. In this work, we use the differential-geometric framework of vector bundles to analyze the properties of parameter-dependent quantum states and generalize the quantum geometric tensor to this setting. This construction is based on a general connection on a Hermitian vector bundle, which defines a notion of quantum state transport in parameter space, and a sub-bundle projector, which constrains the set of accessible quantum states. We show that the sub-bundle geometry is similar to that of submanifolds in Riemannian geometry and is described by generalized Gauss-Codazzi-Mainardi equations. This leads to a novel definition of the quantum geometric tensor that contains an additional curvature contribution. To illustrate our results, we describe the sub-bundle geometry arising in the semiclassical treatment of Dirac fields propagating in curved spacetime and show how the quantum geometric tensor, with its additional curvature contributions, is obtained in this case. As a concrete example, we consider Dirac fermions confined to a hyperbolic plane and demonstrate how spatial curvature influences the quantum geometry.

Notably, because the Pedersen--Weibel category depends only on the large-scale (coarse) structure of the metric space, so too does the classification of Clifford QCAs. For Euclidean lattices, the classification reproduces and expands upon known results, while for more general spaces -- including open cones over finite simplicial complexes -- we relate nontrivial QCAs to generalized homology theories with coefficients in the L-theory spectrum.

    "summary": "arXiv:2301.05214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: It was recently shown how to account for all instantons of hermitian matrix models via (anti-) eigenvalue-tunneling -- including both exponentially-suppressed and exponentially-enhanced transseries-transmonomials which are predicted by resurgence. Matrix-model eigenvalue-tunneling corresponds to ZZ-branes. The present work shows how matrix-model anti-eigenvalues correspond to negative-tension ZZ-branes; and how to compute generic nonperturbative sectors -- with both ZZ and negative-tension-ZZ branes -- in the minimal-string free-energy. Negative-tension D-branes are herein a requirement of resurgence. This results in the construction of minimal-string free-energy transseries and the analytic computation of their resurgent Stokes data. Calculations are presented via Liouville boundary conformal field theory and via (matching) matrix model analysis. Minimal-string results are extended to Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Building on the matrix model analysis, one extension towards topological string theory is obtained via the remodeling-conjecture -- which allows for addressing one-cut, toric Calabi-Yau geometries. Building on the Liouville theory calculation, one other extension towards critical string theory is obtained via the H3+ - Liouville correspondence -- which allows for addressing negative-tension D-instantons in AdS spacetime. Throughout, checks of the construction and formulae are made in several examples, against both Borel resurgent analysis and string-equation transseries data.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2401.10507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The construction of non-Abelian Euclidean Yang-Mills theories in dimension four, as scaling limits of lattice Yang-Mills theories or otherwise, is a central open question of mathematical physics. This paper takes the following small step towards this goal. In any dimension $d\\ge 2$, we construct a scaling limit of $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice Yang-Mills theory coupled to a Higgs field (under the degenerate potential) transforming in the fundamental representation of $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$. After unitary gauge fixing and taking the lattice spacing $\\varepsilon\\to 0$, and simultaneously taking the gauge coupling constant $g\\to 0$ and the Higgs length $\\alpha\\to \\infty$ in such a manner that $\\alpha g$ is always equal to $c\\varepsilon$ for some fixed $c$ and $g= O(\\varepsilon^{50d})$, a stereographic projection of the gauge field is shown to converge to a scale-invariant massive Gaussian field. This gives the first construction of a scaling limit of a non-Abelian lattice Yang-Mills theory in a dimension higher than two, as well as the first rigorous proof of mass generation by the Higgs mechanism in such a theory. Analogous results are proved for $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ theory as well. The question of constructing a non-Gaussian scaling limit remains open.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.09885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of a general local gauge theory can be encoded in the structure of a so-called presymplectic gauge PDE -- an almost-$Q$ bundle over the spacetime exterior algebra, equipped with a compatible presymplectic structure. In the case of a trivial bundle and an invertible presymplectic structure, this reduces to the well-known AKSZ sigma model construction. We develop an extension of the presympletic BV-AKSZ approach to describe local gauge theories with background fields. It turns out that such theories correspond to presymplectic gauge PDEs whose base spaces are again gauge PDEs describing background fields. As such, the geometric structure is that of a bundle over a bundle over a given spacetime. Gauge PDEs over backgrounds arise naturally when studying linearisation, coupling (gauge) fields to background geometry, gauging global symmetries, etc. Less obvious examples involve parametrised systems, Fedosov equations, and the so-called homogeneous (presymplectic) gauge PDEs. The latter are the gauge-invariant generalisations of the familiar homogeneous PDEs and they provide a very concise description of gauge fields on homogeneous spaces such as higher spin gauge fields on Minkowski, (A)dS, and conformal spaces. Finally, we briefly discuss how the higher-form symmetries and their gauging fit into the framework using the simplest example of the Maxwell field.",

We introduce and analyze the asymptotic behavior of the volume-distance-ratio (VDR), defined as the ratio of volumes of small chronological diamonds to appropriate powers of distances between their vertices. In $C^0$ and $C^{0,1}$ spacetimes (which are weaker than the classical $C^2$ regularity), we prove that VDR converges to the Minkowski value as chronological diamonds approach accumulation points.\n  The central contribution is the establishment of inextendibility criteria showing that failure of VDR convergence to the Minkowski value implies inextendibility of the spacetime. These criteria apply to spacetime extensions satisfying $C^0$ locally-null-non-accumulating strongly-causal conditions and $C^{0,1}$ strongly-causal conditions, where the locally-null-non-accumulation condition is introduced as a fundamental structural property ensuring the validity of VDR-based inextendibility criteria.\n  Concrete applications demonstrate the power and scope of these methods. We prove that $2$-dimensional Misner spacetime is $C^0$ strongly-causal inextendible and that spatially flat FLRW spacetimes with linear scale factor behavior are $C^0$ locally-null-non-accumulating strongly-causal inextendible.

However, it is unknown how to implement an MPU as a quantum circuit since the individual tensors describing the MPU are not unitary. In this Letter, we show that a large class of MPUs can be implemented with a polynomial-depth quantum circuit. For an $N$-site MPU built from a repeated bulk tensor with open boundary, we explicitly construct a quantum circuit of polynomial depth $T = O(N^{\\alpha})$ realizing the MPU, where the constant $\\alpha$ depends only on the bulk and boundary tensor and not the system size $N$. We show that this class includes nontrivial unitaries that generate long-range entanglement and, in particular, contains a large class of unitaries constructed from representations of $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras. Furthermore, we also adapt our construction to nonuniform translationally-varying MPUs and show that they can be implemented by a circuit of depth $O(N^{\\beta} \\, \\mathrm{poly}\\, D)$ where $\\beta \\le 1 + \\log_2 \\sqrt{D}/ s_{\\min}$, with $D$ being the bond dimension and $s_{\\min}$ the smallest nonzero Schmidt value of the normalized Choi state corresponding to the MPU.",

As the spin increases, both the oscillating frequency of the scalar wave and its damping rate decrease, which indicates progressively longer lived modes in the absence of absorption due to a horizon. We have verified the correspondence in the Eikonal limit, by obtaining the radius of the photon ring, its orbital frequency, and the Lyaponov exponent. Next, we compared the Teo wormhole QNM with that of the Kerr black hole QNM to find that the Kerr QNM is dictated by absorption at the horizon and they also exhibit symmetric pro-grade retrograde mode splitting, whereas the Teo wormhole QNM shows a stronger, and spatially confined response to spin. The Teo wormhole also exhibit partial reflection at the throat and a very distinct one-sided mode splitting which rapidly saturates as the spin increases. Additionally, the rotating Teo wormhole allows an ergoregion with the possibility of frequency kinematics compatible with superradiance. Due to the absence of an event horizon or a dissipative boundary, there is no evidence of classical superradiant amplification that was seen in Kerr. The results we obtained clearly demonstrates how rotation and boundary conditions jointly shape wave propagation in horizonless compact objects. They also provide certain characteristic spectral signatures that can be used to distinguish rotating wormhole spacetimes from rotating black hole spacetimes.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.01549v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We study a well mixed SIR epidemic model with heterogeneous susceptibility and infectivity, allowing for an arbitrary joint distribution of these traits. Using an exact final size formulation and a branching process approximation for early epidemic dynamics, we show that both the final epidemic size and the probability of a major outbreak are monotone with respect to the concordance order of the joint susceptibility infectivity distribution. In particular, among all couplings with fixed marginal trait distributions, comonotonic dependence maximizes epidemic severity, yielding sharp distribution free upper bounds. A key implication is that epidemic outcomes cannot be ordered by susceptibility heterogeneity alone: while increasing susceptibility variance reduces the final size under independence, positive dependence between susceptibility and infectivity can locally increase epidemic size for any basic reproduction number exceeding one. We further show that neither susceptibility variance nor the sign of the covariance suffices to determine epidemic severity under dependence. These findings offer new insights into epidemic risk assessment under limited information.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02308v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major global public health problem, contributing to an estimated 4.95 million deaths in 2019 and projected to cause up to 10 million deaths annually and 100 trillion dollars in cumulative economic losses by 2050. Its emergence and spread result from complex biological, ecological, and socioeconomic interactions. Mathematical modelling is a key tool to study AMR dynamics, yet the literature remains fragmented and methodologically limited. This review synthesizes recent mathematical modelling studies to identify trends, biases, and research gaps. Methods: A scoping review following PRISMA-ScR guidelines was conducted. PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for studies published between 2019 and 2024 that developed mathematical models of AMR. After screening and duplicate removal, 36 studies were included. Data were extracted using a structured framework covering model context, construction and parameters, and outputs and validation. Results: Most studies relied on deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) models and focused on bacterial resistance in human hosts, with only one adopting a One Health perspective. Conjugation and mutation were the most commonly modelled resistance mechanisms, whereas transduction, transformation, host immunity, spatial heterogeneity, and environmental components were rarely included. Few studies incorporated economic impacts, and a strong geographic bias toward high-income countries was observed. Conclusion: Mathematical modelling of AMR is an active field but characterized by limited methodological diversity. While deterministic ODE models have advanced understanding of AMR dynamics, future work should integrate stochasticity, spatial structure, ecological interactions, and One Health perspectives, as well as economic and social variables, to inform global strategies to mitigate AMR.",

Such a state corresponds to a strategy adopted by the population such that a rare mutant strategy cannot invade the population. In parallel, the dynamical formulation of evolutionary game theory -- particularly through replicator dynamics embodying the tenet of survival of the fittest -- provides a framework for modelling frequency-dependent selection over time. While it is well known that an ESS corresponds to stable fixed point in replicator dynamics, the evolutionary game-theoretic characterization of limit cycles is unknown. Here we fill this lacuna by defining oscillatory ESS (OESS) which we prove to be a stable limit cycle. We also show when an OESS is unique and if there are multiple OESSes, then what their locations are in the phase space.",

In population dynamics, the mean fitness and the fraction of a trait in the steady state are important because they indicate how well the trait and the population adapt to the environment. In this study, we examine the parallel mutation-reproduction model, which is one of the simplest models of an evolvable population. As an extension of the Markov chain tree theorem, we derive diagrammatic expressions for the static responses of mean fitness and the steady-state distribution of the population. For the parallel mutation-reproduction model, we consider self-loops, which represent trait reproduction and are excluded from the Markov chain tree theorem for the linear master equation. To generalize the theorem, we introduce the concept of rooted $0$/$1$ loop forests, which generalize spanning trees with loops. We demonstrate that the weights of rooted $0$/$1$ loop forests yield the static responses of mean fitness and the steady-state distribution. Our results provide exact expressions for the static responses and the steady-state distribution. Additionally, we discuss approximations of these expressions in cases where reproduction or mutation is dominant. We provide numerical examples to illustrate these approximations and exact expressions.",

Classical gene-centered models explain adaptation through frequency changes driven by differential fitness, yet they often overlook the higher-order organization and causal closure that characterize living systems. Here we revisit several evolutionary frameworks, from the replicator equation to group selection and holobiont dynamics, and show that evolutionary change in population frequencies can be expressed as a Jeffreys divergence. Building on this foundation, we introduce a categorical model of Information Handlers (IH), entities capable of self-maintenance, mutation, and combination. This abstract architecture illustrates the usefulness of category theory for framing evolutionary processes that range from very simple to highly complex. The same categorical scheme can represent basic allele-frequency change as well as more elaborate scenarios involving reproductive interactions, symbiosis, and other organizational layers. A key feature of the framework is that different levels of evolutionary change can be summarized through a measure that quantifies the information generated, thereby distinguishing diverse types of evolutionary transformation such as individual and sexual selection, mate choice, or even holobiont selection. Finally, we show that the informational partition associated with host-microbiome pairings in holobionts generalizes the information-theoretic structure previously developed for non-random mating, revealing a common underlying architecture across biological scales.",

Here, we focus on modeling fold-switching proteins, which remodel their secondary and/or tertiary structures and change their functions in response to cellular stimuli. These underrepresented members of the protein universe serve as test cases for a method's generalizability.

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02265v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Polymer-based long-acting injectables (LAIs) have transformed the treatment of chronic diseases by enabling controlled drug delivery, thus reducing dosing frequency and extending therapeutic duration. Achieving controlled drug release from LAIs requires extensive optimization of the complex underlying physicochemical properties. Machine learning (ML) can accelerate LAI development by modeling the complex relationships between LAI properties and drug release. However, recent ML studies have provided limited information on key properties that modulate drug release, due to the lack of custom modeling and analysis tailored to LAI data. This paper presents a novel data transformation and explainable ML approach to synthesize actionable information from 321 LAI formulations by predicting early drug release at 24, 48, and 72 hours, classification of release profile types, and prediction of complete release profiles. These three experiments investigate the contribution and control of LAI material characteristics in early and complete drug release profiles. A strong correlation (>0.65) is observed between the true and predicted drug release in 72 hours, while a 0.87 F1-score is obtained in classifying release profile types. A time-independent ML framework predicts delayed biphasic and triphasic curves with better performance than current time-dependent approaches. Shapley additive explanations reveal the relative influence of material characteristics during early and for complete release which fill several gaps in previous in-vitro and ML-based studies. The novel approach and findings can provide a quantitative strategy and recommendations for scientists to optimize the drug-release dynamics of LAI.

Across proteins, spider webs and flame dynamics, vibrational and architectural principles recur as tonal hierarchies, harmonic progressions, and long-range musical form. Using reversible mappings, from molecular spectra to musical tones and from three-dimensional networks to playable instruments, we show how sound functions as a scientific probe, an epistemic inversion where listening becomes a mode of seeing and musical composition becomes a blueprint for matter. These mappings excavate deep time: patterns originating in femtosecond molecular vibrations or billion-year evolutionary histories become audible. We posit that novelty in science and art emerges when constraints cannot be satisfied within existing degrees of freedom, forcing expansion of the space of viable configurations. Selective imperfection provides the mechanism restoring balance between coherence and adaptability. Quantitative support comes from exhaustive enumeration of all 2^12 musical scales, revealing that culturally significant systems cluster in a mid-entropy, mid-defect corridor, directly paralleling the Hall-Petch optimum where intermediate defect densities maximize material strength. Iterating these mappings creates productive collisions between human creativity and physics, generating new information as musical structures encounter evolutionary constraints. We show how swarm-based AI models compose music exhibiting human-like structural signatures such as small-world connectivity, modular integration, long-range coherence, suggesting a route beyond interpolation toward invention.

We analyzed 426,850 bioactive molecules from a rigorously curated intersection of PubChem, ChEMBL, and eMolecules databases, revealing severe heteroskedasticity in linear models predicting computed logP values (XLOGP3): residual variance increases 4.2-fold in lipophilic regions (logP greater than 5) compared to balanced regions (logP 2 to 4). Classical remediation strategies (Weighted Least Squares and Box-Cox transformation) failed to resolve this violation (Breusch-Pagan p-value less than 0.0001 for all variants). Tree-based ensemble methods (Random Forest R-squared of 0.764, XGBoost R-squared of 0.765) proved inherently robust to heteroskedasticity while delivering superior predictive performance. SHAP analysis resolved a critical multicollinearity paradox: despite a weak bivariate correlation of 0.146, molecular weight emerged as the single most important predictor (mean absolute SHAP value of 0.573), with its effect suppressed in simple correlations by confounding with topological polar surface area (TPSA).

In this work, we examine how specific structural features govern charge storage and explain capacitance variations among carbide-derived carbon (CDC) electrodes. Two key methodological and mechanistic advances are introduced. First, we propose a physically motivated, electric-field-based definition of the ion sphere of influence, which avoids the ambiguity of radial distribution function-based cutoffs and enables a more reliable characterization of local ion--electrode interactions. Second, we introduce an ion-resolved channel-width descriptor that quantifies pore accessibility by identifying the narrowest passage a counter-ion must traverse to enter a pore, directly linking accessibility to ion decoordination. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of supercapacitors comprising realistic CDC electrodes and a room-temperature ionic liquid electrolyte under applied potentials, we show that carbon atoms located at the edges of graphitic sheets consistently accumulate higher charge than basal-plane atoms across all electrode types. The fraction of edge atoms increases with structural disorder and correlates with enhanced capacitance, in agreement with recent experimental findings linking disorder to charge storage. Furthermore, analysis of pore size and channel width reveals that ion decoordination is governed primarily by channel width rather than pore size alone. Together, these results establish edge atom concentration and pore channel width as decisive structural descriptors controlling charge accumulation in nanoporous carbon supercapacitors, providing clear design guidelines for optimizing electrode architectures.",

We studied geometry optimizations, relative stability, atomization energies, Fermi energy, energy gap, electronic properties, electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, and thermodynamic analysis, along with IR and NMR spectra. Consistently, our findings revealed distinct properties and characteristics among different C36 fullerene isomers. The energetic order of C36 fullerene isomers was established as C36-D3h < C36-C1 < C36-Cs < C36-C2 < C36-D2, a trend unaffected by the encapsulation of oxygen. Notably, the D2 isomer displayed the smallest energy gap, indicating higher electrical conductivity compared to other isomers, while it exhibited the largest gap after encapsulation. Furthermore, we observed that the C1 (D2) isomer exhibited the largest (smallest) Electric dipole moment among the studied C36 isomers, whereas the C2 (D2) isomer demonstrated the largest Electric dipole moment among the O@C36 isomers studied. The encapsulation of oxygen in C36 isomers influenced their properties, including alterations in electronic properties, IR, and NMR chemical shifts.

However, creating a quantitatively reliable potential energy surface (PES) for this weakly bound system remains a significant computational challenge. In this work, we present a comprehensive, multi-level investigation of the He-Bz interaction, establishing benchmark energies using high-level coupled-cluster singles-and-doubles with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)) methods extrapolated to the complete basis set limit and assessing higher-order (CCSDT(Q)) contributions. We use symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) to benchmark it against CCSD(T) and to decompose the interaction into its physical components-confirming it is dominated by a balance between dispersion and exchange-repulsion. A continuous, three-dimensional PES is constructed from discrete ab initio points using multifidelity Gaussian process regression that combines density functional theory results with sparse coupled-cluster energies. The result is a highly accurate PES with sub-cm-1 accuracy that obeys physical laws. This new PES is applied to path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations to study the solvation of 4He atoms on benzene at low temperatures. Our PIMC results reveal qualitatively different solvation behavior, particularly in the filling of adsorption layers, when compared to simulations using commonly employed empirical Lennard-Jones potentials.

Using canonical and harmonic approximations, the RF rate constants can be determined from the transition dipole moment time autocorrelation functions. Application to the naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene cations is presented based on quantum chemical inputs obtained from time-dependent density-functional theory.

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02294v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We consider the thermochemical impact of post-CCSD(T) contributions to the total atomization energy (TAE, the sum of all bond energies) of first- and second-row molecules, and specifically their coupling with the subvalence correlation contribution. In particular, we find large contributions from (Q) when there are several neighboring second-row atoms. Otherwise, both higher-order triples $T_3$--(T) and connected quadruples (Q) are important in systems with strong static correlation. Reoptimization of the reference geometry for core-valence correlation increases the calculated TAE across the board, most pronouncedly so for second-row compounds with neighboring second-row atoms. %just slightly increases the calculated TAE for all species, but more pronouncedly so if strong static correlation is present, as well as for second-row compounds, again especially with neighboring second-row atoms. We present a first proposal for a `W5 theory' protocol and compare computed TAEs for the W4-08 benchmark with prior reference values. For some key second-row species, the new values represent nontrivial revisions. Our predicted TAE$_0$ values (TAE at 0 K) agree well with the ATcT (active thermochemical tables) values, including for the very recent expansion of the ATcT network to boron, silicon, and sulfur compounds.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.02343v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We have extended the origin-invariant length gauge (LG(OI)) approach -- originally developed by Caricato and co-workers for optical rotation (OR) and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) -- to vibrational circular dichroism (VCD). This approach avoids the need for gauge-including atomic orbitals (GIAOs), which are typically required to circumvent the unphysical dependence of the CD rotatory strengths on the arbitrary choice of coordinate origin for length gauge (LG) computations. Benchmark VCD spectra are presented for (P)-hydrogen peroxide, (S)-methyloxirane, (1R, 5R)-{\\alpha}-pinene, and (1R, 4R)-camphor using Hartree-Fock (HF) theory and density functional theory (DFT) methods across a range of basis sets and compared to those obtained from LG, velocity-gauge (VG), and GIAO computations. These analyses show that for VCD the LG(OI) approach does not converge to the basis-set limit as rapidly as the GIAO approach, but does yield similar quality spectra as GIAO for all major VCD peaks for quadruple-zeta-quality basis sets. The LG(OI) and VG VCD spectra are less reliable compared to GIAOs for smaller basis sets.",

Recent advances in 3D experimental techniques have revealed conflicts between observed GB migration behaviors and classical theoretical models. These contradictions raise two fundamental questions, namely, whether GB migration is linearly related to curvature, and how GB energy affect GB migration? Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of GB migration dynamics in polycrystals and resolve these conflicts within a theoretical framework. Unexpectedly, in a polycrystalline system, the range of GB migration velocities shows little correlation with the magnitude of its curvature. The extent of the influence of GB energy on GB migration is revealed to mostly depend on GB step energy. Finally, a more general GB migration formula is derived to incorporate various driving forces beyond curvature.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.01437v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The variational optimization of high-dimensional neural network models, such as those used in neural quantum states (NQS), presents a significant challenge in machine intelligence. Conventional first-order stochastic methods (e.g., Adam) are plagued by slow convergence, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and numerical instability, preventing NQS from reaching the high accuracy required for fundamental science. We address this fundamental optimization bottleneck by introducing the implicitly restarted Lanczos (IRL) method as the core engine for NQS training. Our key innovation is an inherently stable second-order optimization framework that recasts the ill-conditioned parameter update problem into a small, well-posed Hermitian eigenvalue problem. By solving this problem efficiently and robustly with IRL, our approach automatically determines the optimal descent direction and step size, circumventing the need for demanding hyperparameter tuning and eliminating the numerical instabilities common in standard iterative solvers. We demonstrate that IRL enables shallow NQS architectures (with orders of magnitude fewer parameters) to consistently achieve extreme precision (1e-12 kcal/mol) in just 3 to 5 optimization steps. For the F2 molecule, this translates to an approximate 17,900-fold speed-up in total runtime compared to Adam. This work establishes IRL as a superior, robust, and efficient second-order optimization strategy for variational quantum models, paving the way for the practical, high-fidelity application of neural networks in quantum physics and chemistry.",

Time dependent square displacements are calculated directly from numerical solutions of Pauli master equations, for five different rate kernels: exact Fermi golden rule (FGR) rate expression, stationary phase interpolation (SPI) approximation, semiclassical (SC) approximation, classical Marcus rate expression, and Miller-Abrahams expression. All results demonstrate diffusive behavior in the steady state limit. The results based on the FGR rate expression show that the charge transport in quantum bath can be much more sensitive to the disorder than the prediction from the classical Marcus expression. While the SPI approximation captures this general trend reasonably well, the SC approximation tends to be unreliable at both quantitative and qualitative levels, and becomes even worse than the classical Marcus expression under certain conditions. These results offer useful guidance in the choice of approximate rate kernels for larger scale simulations, and also demonstrate significant but fragile positive effects of quantum environments on the charge hopping dynamics.",

Beyond controlling steady-state production levels, allostery also regulates the timing and duration over which information is transmitted.

In both cases, the \"effective body-orderedness\" of MLIPs remains largely unexplained: how do the models decompose the total energy into body-ordered contributions, and how does their body-orderedness affect the accuracy and learning behavior? In answering these questions, we first discuss the complexities in imposing the many-body expansion on ab initio calculations at the atomic limit. Next, we train a curated set of MLIPs on datasets of hydrogen clusters and reveal the inherent tendency of the ML models to deduce their own, effective body-order trends, which are dependent on the model type and dataset makeup.

During fertilization, deviations from the normal mechanical range can hinder sperm penetration, ultimately reducing fertilization efficiency and compromising embryo quality. However, current methods for measuring oocyte mechanics often suffer from serious cellular damage, low automation levels, and large measurement errors. To address these limitations, we developed an AI-guided micronewton-scale mechanical measurement system for safe and automated oocyte quality assessment. The system integrates voice interaction with automated experimental workflows to control a magnetically actuated microgripper, which applies defined loading forces to induce micron-scale compressive deformation of the oocyte. Combined with AI-assisted object detection and image segmentation algorithms, the system captures cellular deformation in real time, enabling precise calculation of the oocyte's compressive modulus. This measurement system enables automated, quantitative, and non-destructive evaluation of oocyte mechanical properties, providing an effective approach for oocyte quality screening in in vitro fertilization (IVF) and other assisted reproductive technologies (ART).",

    "title": "AI-Assisted Hyperspectral Interferometry and Single-Cell Dispersion Imaging",
    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00997v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Interferometry techniques are essential for extracting phase information from optical systems, enabling precise measurements of dispersion and highly sensitive detection of perturbations. While phase sensing offers enhanced sensitivity compared to conventional spectroscopy methods, this sensitivity often makes systems more vulnerable to external factors such as vibrations, introducing instability and noise. In this work, we demonstrate a broadband and AI-enhanced interferometry method, denoted general polarization common-path interferometry (GPCPI), that relaxes the polarization constraints of traditional common-path interferometry. The polarization decoupling feature enables simultaneous amplitude and phase measurements supplemented with deep neural autoencoders to detect phase anomalies in the spectrum through the analysis of second order derivative mapping of the phase profile, enhancing the accuracy of broadband phase measurements. The approach enables an order of magnitude improvement in phase stability compared to state-of-the-art interferometry techniques, leading to higher accuracy in phase sensing. Plasmonic metasurface phase sensing and hyperspectral single-cell dispersion imaging demonstrate the capability and sensitivity of the method over conventional spectroscopy. Our own adopted version of deep learning model, ConvNeXt V2, enables single-shot and real-time tracking of phase variation with minimized noise. Interference fringes over the cell cultured samples reveal the fingerprints of the normal (CCD-32Sk) vs cancerous (COLO-829) skin cells, enabling robust cell classification and disease diagnosis at single-cell level. The proposed interferometry technique offers a reliable, compact, and stable solution for broadband phase measurements and single-cell dispersion imaging for applications in metrology, molecular diagnostics, drug discovery, and quantum sensing.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.01850v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Allostery is a fundamental mechanism of protein regulation and is commonly interpreted as modulating enzymatic activity or product abundance. Here we show that this view is incomplete. Using a stochastic model of allosteric regulation combined with an information-theoretic analysis, we quantify the mutual information between an enzyme's regulatory state and the states of downstream signaling components. Beyond controlling steady-state production levels, allostery also regulates the timing and duration over which information is transmitted. By tuning the temporal operating regime of signaling pathways, allosteric regulation enables distinct dynamical outcomes from identical molecular components, providing a physical mechanism for temporal information flow, signaling specificity, and coordination without changes in metabolic pathways.",

For instance, the cell cortex is a thin network below the cell membrane ; contraction of the cell cortex allows cells to round up during cell division. Contractile actin-myosin networks are often represented at large scale by continuous theories such as active gel models. However, experimental perturbations are microscopic while parameters in continuous models are macroscopic, thus making those models hard to falsify experimentally. Here we use numerical simulations, in which we can access both microscopic and macroscopic quantities, to show that active gel models can indeed be applied to describe contractile actin. We predict that contractile stress should scale linearly with actin density, which is confirmed by numerical simulations. Moreover, we can accurately predict how the contractile stress depends on motor properties such as unloaded speed and stall force.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2509.11801v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Adhesion-independent migration is a prominent mode of cell motility in confined environments, yet the physical principles that guide such movement remain incompletely understood. We present a phase-field model for simulating the motility of deformable, non-adherent cells driven by contractile surface instabilities of the cell cortex. This model couples surface and bulk hydrodynamics, accommodates large shape deformations and incorporates a diffusible contraction-generating molecule (myosin) that drives cortical flows. These capabilities enable a systematic exploration of how mechanical cues direct cell polarization and migration. We first demonstrate that spontaneous symmetry breaking of cortical activity can lead to persistent and directed movement in channels. We then investigate how various physical cues - including gradients in friction, viscosity, and channel width as well as external flows and hydrodynamic interactions between cells - steer migration. Our results show that active surface dynamics can generate stimulus-specific cell behaviors, such as migration up friction gradients or escape from narrow regions. Beyond cell migration, the model offers a versatile platform for exploring the mechanics of active surfaces in biological systems.",

After sparse seeding, the cells divide and grow into locally ordered, but randomly oriented, domains that then interact with each other and the substrate. Global alignment with the substrate is only achieved above a critical density, suggesting a collective mechanism for the sensing of substrate anisotropy. The system jams at high density, where both reorientation and proliferation stop. Using a continuum model of a proliferating nematic liquid crystal, we examine the competition between growth-driven alignment and substrate-driven alignment in controlling the density and structure of the final jammed state. We propose that anisotropic traction forces and the tendency of cells to align perpendicular to the direction of density gradients act in concert to provide a mechanism for collective cell alignment.",

Here, we introduce a statistics-based group-testing strategy, which we couple with luminescence quenching assays to efficiently identify cooperative molecular interactions. Utilizing the quenching of a photosensitizer as a quick readout for chemical activity, 4,950 substrate pairs were screened in only 504 experiments, enabled through a combinatorial design theory-based pooling approach and iterative deconvolution. Therefore, two algorithms\u2014a greedy algorithm for group design and an iterative sectioning deconvolution method to resolve active pairs\u2014were implemented. Fifteen cooperative pairs were identified, and the nature of their interactions and the resulting electronic perturbations were investigated. In a systematic follow-up screen, it was found that the identified active pairs exhibit high reactivity towards a broad group of reaction partners. One such pair led to the discovery of a bench-stable reagent, enabling efficient and regioselective trifluoromethylthiolation reactions. This work establishes a broadly applicable framework for accelerating the discovery of cooperative reactivity through optimized experimental designs.",

    "title": "The E3 ubiquitin ligase mechanism specifying target-directed microRNA degradation",
    "summary": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) associate with Argonaute (AGO) proteins to form complexes that down-regulate target RNAs, including mRNAs from most human genes. Within each complex, the miRNA pairs to target mRNAs to specify their repression, and AGO provides effector function while also protecting the miRNA from cellular nucleases. Although much has been learned about this mode of posttranscriptional gene regulation, less is known about how the miRNAs themselves are regulated. In one such regulatory pathway, unusual miRNA targets called \"trigger\" RNAs reverse the canonical regulatory logic and instead down-regulate microRNAs. This target-directed miRNA degradation (TDMD) is thought to require a cullin [mdash]RING E3 ligase (CRL) because it depends on the cullin protein CUL3 and other ubiquitylation components, including the BC-box protein ZSWIM8. ZSWIM8 is required for murine perinatal viability and for destabilization of most short-lived miRNAs, but is otherwise poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that a human AGO [mdash]miRNA-- trigger complex selectively binds ZSWIM8 for CUL3-mediated polyubiquitylation of the AGO protein within this complex. Cryogenic electron-microscopy (cryo-EM) analyses show how ZSWIM8 recognizes the distinct AGO2 and miRNA--trigger conformations shaped by pairing of the miRNA to the trigger. For example, this pairing extracts the miRNA from a binding pocket within AGO2, allowing the pocket to be captured by ZSWIM8, and it directs the trigger RNA along a distinct trajectory to be also recognized by ZSWIM8. These results biochemically establish AGO binding and polyubiquitylation as the key regulatory step of TDMD, define a unique CRL class, and reveal generalizable RNA--RNA, RNA--protein, and protein--protein interactions that specify the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of AGO with exquisite selectivity. The substrate features recognized by the E3 ubiquitin ligase do not conform to a conventional degron, but rather establish a two-RNA-factor authentication mechanism specifying a protein ubiquitylation substrate.",

    "title": "TRPV4 Inhibition by a Natural Product Mediates Analgesia",
    "summary": "The transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) channel, a polymodal calcium-permeable cation channel, is activated by diverse stimuli, including hyposmolarity, moderate heat, mechanical stress, and acidic pH. TRPV4 plays a critical role in the onset and progression of pain and is implicated in multiple pathological conditions, positioning it as an attractive therapeutic target. However, the development of TRPV4-targeted therapeutics has been hindered by limited mechanistic understanding of its inhibition. Here, the natural product (R)-1-(3-ethylphenyl)ethane-1,2-diol (AH001) is identified as a potent, subtype-selective TRPV4 inhibitor. A potential gating mechanism of TRPV4 inhibition is proposed through a combination of structural analyses and site-directed mutagenesis. Electrophysiological studies and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) further reveal that AH001's glucuronide metabolite, AHP, retains robust TRPV4 inhibitory activity, providing a critical structural basis for rational optimization of AH001 as a lead compound. Notably, AH001 demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing neuronal hyperexcitability in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and produced pronounced analgesic effects across multiple pain models, highlighting its therapeutic potential in pain relief. This study offers critical structural and mechanistic insights into TRPV4 inhibition and lays the groundwork for the structure-based design of TRPV4-targeted therapeutics.",

    "title": "Nucleotide diversity is a poor predictor of short-term adaptive potential",
    "summary": "A capacity to adapt is essential for a population to avoid extinction in a changing world and is recognised as a global conservation priority. Adaptation requires additive (heritable) genetic variation for traits that influence survival and fecundity, but measuring this variation is difficult, particularly in species of conservation concern. Instead, molecular genetic diversity is often used to infer adaptive potential. However, previous research has cast doubt on the suitability of traditional molecular markers (allozymes and microsatellites) for this purpose given their weak relationship with heritability - a common measure of additive genetic variance. Recent advances in sequencing technology have since shifted focus towards nucleotide diversity and variation in functional regions, but their practicality for predicting adaptive potential remains debated and untested. Furthermore, heritability itself is a poor proxy for adaptive potential because it depends on environmental variance. We collated 2,113 published estimates of evolvability - a measure of additive genetic variance that avoids environmental confounding - across 193 eukaryotic species, and evaluated how well evolvability is predicted by molecular diversity. We find that microsatellite and nucleotide diversity are not significantly correlated to each other, and neither predict evolvability (nucleotide diversity explains 0.7% of interspecific differences in evolvability and doubling nucleotide diversity only corresponds to a 9.2% increase in evolvability). With new theoretical work, we show that such weak associations are expected. Together, our results suggest that simple molecular measures of genetic variation are insufficient for predicting adaptive potential and continued reliance on these metrics risks misinforming conservation management.",

    "title": "CNOT10 is involved in TTP-mediated AU-rich element containing mRNA metabolism, independent of mRNA decay regulation",
    "summary": "Tristetraprolin (TTP)/ ZFP36 is an RNA binding protein that is involved in the turnover regulation of target adenylate-uridylate-rich RNA element (ARE) containing mRNAs. AREs are present in the 3'-untranslated region of transcripts expressed from many immediate-early genes, including cytokines and chemokines. It has been demonstrated that TTP-mediated post-transcriptional mRNA decay regulation is crucial for modulating physiological control, particularly in response to inflammatory stimulation. TTP is associated with the CCR4-NOT deadenylation complex through the TTP C-terminus to promote mRNA decay. However, it is not fully understood whether there are additional sites within TTP that contribute to its function through interacting with other factors. We analyzed the functionality of the unique tryptophan residues located in the TTP N-terminus using a cell-based assay system that consists of a tetracycline-responsive CMV promoter-driven, intron-inserted luciferase (LUC). This system enabled us to analyze TTP activity during both the early phase and the steady-state phase of gene expression, as well as in the post-transcriptional mRNA decay following the treatment of tetracycline analogs. Meanwhile, we identified putative TTP associates using a proximity labeling method. We found that tryptophan residues in the TTP N-terminus together with CNOT10, a component of the CCR4-NOT complex, were involved specifically in the reduction of the ARE-containing LUC mRNA level during the early phase of gene expression. However, they were not involved in the decay of LUC mRNA in the steady-state phase. We propose a novel post-transcriptional TTP functionality in the reduction of ARE-containing mRNA level, which differs from the well-characterized mRNA decay activity.",

    "title": "MCBO: Mammalian Cell Bioprocessing Ontology, A Hub-and-Spoke, IOF-Anchored Application Ontology",
    "summary": "Mammalian cell-based biopharmaceutical manufacturing generates vast, heterogeneous datasets that remain fragmented due to the lack of a standardized metadata framework. A key challenge in biologics manufacturing is linking bioreactor conditions, cell line characteristics and recombinant product production. A datahub for mammalian cell bioprocessing, integrated by semantic technologies, will serve as a tool to understand and query the connections between these complex datasets. While existing ontologies cover general biological and experimental concepts, they often lack the operational specificity required to harmonize bioreactor conditions, cell line engineering, and product quality metrics. To address this specific gap, we present the Mammalian Cell Bioprocessing Ontology (MCBO), a hub-and-spoke application ontology built on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) foundations and anchored to the Industrial Ontology Foundry (IOF) Core. MCBO formalizes the process-participant-quality modeling pattern, enabling precise tracking of culture environmental conditions as qualities of the physical culture system. We demonstrate the utility of MCBO through a central datahub populated with 723 curated cell culture process instances and 325 unique bioprocess samples from published studies. The framework is validated against eight competency questions implemented via SPARQL, demonstrating efficient cross-study querying of culture optimization, cell line engineering, and multi-omics integration. By providing a stable, schema-independent substrate for data harmonization, MCBO enables AI agent-powered, human-in-the-loop workflows and facilitates LLM-assisted extraction of structured metadata from legacy records. MCBO is open-source and designed for deployment behind institutional firewalls to support interoperable biomanufacturing intelligence while maintaining intellectual property sensitivity. MCBO is supported by the International Biomanufacturing Network (IBioNe), which aims to accelerate discoveries and developments by providing a network of biomanufacturing training and workforce development to educate the next generation of biomanufacturing experts.

    "title": "Inversions support both parallel and location-specific adaptations in snail ecotypes",
    "summary": "Replicated hybrid zones between ecotypes established over within shore environmental gradients provide an opportunity to study the genomic architecture of barriers to gene flow. The marine snail Littorina fabalis segregates locally into dwarf and large ecotypes over wave-exposure gradients on northwestern European shores. Previous work focusing on a hybrid zone in Sweden revealed strong genetic differentiation between the ecotypes, concentrated in 12 putative chromosomal inversions. Here we compare the Swedish hybrid zone with samples from France distributed across a similar wave-exposed gradient. Our aims were to test if similar exposure gradients promote parallel ecotype distributions and hybrid zones, and if similar genomic architectures contribute to divergence and adaptation across the gradients. Unpredictably, we found that the shell size cline was reversed in France compared to Sweden, with small individuals occupying the more-sheltered end of the environmental gradient in Sweden but the more-exposed end in France. We also observed a cline in shell colour in France, whereas nearly all Swedish snails were yellow. Using whole-genome sequencing, we found similar levels of genetic differentiation between ecotypes in both places. Most of the differences were accounted for by the same 15 inversions, and the arrangement clines showed similar associations to the wave-exposure gradient in both hybrid zones. These inversions were enriched in SNPs differentiating the ecotypes that were either specific to one hybrid zone or showed reversed cline patterns between zones. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) detected significant associations between genomic regions within inversions and shell size in Sweden, while one inversion was associated with colour in France. Our results show that the same inversions play a dual role: they support ecotype differences across similar environmental gradients in distant locations, while also contribute site-specific variation contributing to local adaptation.",

    "title": "Predicting TCR-pMHC Binding by Reinforcement Learning",
    "summary": "The binding between T cell receptors (TCRs) and peptide-major histocompatibility complexes (pMHCs) is fundamental to the immune system ability to recognize and eliminate pathogens. Accurate prediction of TCR-pMHC interactions holds significant promise for advancing cancer immunotherapy, vaccine design, and autoimmune disease research. However, existing approaches often treat the sequences, structures, and functions of TCRs, peptides, and MHC molecules in isolation, neglecting their interdependencies and hence limiting the prediction accuracy. In this study, we present ProTCR, a novel approach that integrates sequence, structural, and functional information within a reinforcement learning framework, offering a new paradigm for predicting TCR-pMHC binding. The reinforcement learning optimization enables ProTCR to generate TCR-pMHC sequences with enhanced binding propensity, thereby improving prediction accuracy. On benchmark datasets such as IEDB and VDJdb, ProTCR achieves an AUROC of 0.75, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 32.7%, while offering interpretable insights into the structural and sequence determinants of binding. We further validate ProTCR using TCRs and neoantigens derived from a cervical cancer patient via proteogenomic profiling. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between T cell clonal expansion and ProTCR-predicted TCR-peptide binding scores, supporting the biological relevance of the model. Additionally, ProTCR demonstrates robust performance in predicting SARS-CoV-2 TCR-pMHC complexes and generating MHC-specific peptides with potential applications in peptide-based immunotherapies. Collectively, these findings establish ProTCR as a powerful and interpretable tool for TCR-pMHC binding prediction, with broad utility across immunology research and translational applications.",

    "title": "Most disease gene variants show minimal population differentiation despite incomplete coverage",
    "summary": "Background Underrepresentation of non-European populations in genomic databases creates challenges for ancestry-matched variant interpretation, particularly when population frequency data are incomplete. Current approaches either assume missing populations have reference allele fixation (naive zero-imputation) or restrict analyses to observed populations (missingness-aware), but the clinical impact of these methodological choices remains unquantified. Methods We compared naive and missingness-aware differentiation metrics across 72,915 variants in 17 African-relevant disease genes with documented selection or clinical significance, using 10-population data from the 1000 Genomes Project Phase 3. Genome-wide validation employed 1,102,375 chromosome 22 variants with complete 26-population coverage. Population differentiation was quantified as maximum absolute reference allele frequency difference (max--{Delta}p--). Highdifferentiation variants (max--{Delta}p-- [&ge;] 0.5) were compared between disease genes and chromosomal background using Fishers exact tests with bootstrap confidence intervals. Results Methods showed high overall correlation (Spearman {rho} = 0.9969) with only 0.71% disagreement (518/72,915 variants), concentrated among variants with incomplete population coverage. However, 350 variants (0.48%) exceeded the high-differentiation threshold, including wellcharacterized ancestry-informative markers under documented selection. Disease genes showed 4.75fold depletion of highly differentiated variants relative to genome-wide background (Fishers exact test OR = 0.210, 95% CI [0.188, 0.233], p < 10-316), indicating that functional constraint limits frequency divergence except at sites under positive selection. Complete population coverage eliminated method disagreement (chromosome 22: Spearman {rho} = 1.0000, zero disagreements). Conclusions Ancestry-matched variant interpretation is not universally required but becomes critical for a small, clinically enriched subset (0.48%) showing substantial population differentiation. Functional constraint in disease genes concentrates extreme differentiation at specific adaptive sites rather than distributing it across functionally important regions. These findings provide empirical guidance for resource allocation in equitable variant interpretation frameworks.",

    "title": "Prebiotic aqueous reactions catalyzed by native nickel without hydrogen",
    "summary": "Compared to iron, nickel is comparatively rare as a transition metal in enzymes. But it is essential in several enzymes of carbon and energy metabolism in acetogens (bacteria) and methanogens (archaea), which use the acetyl-CoA pathway of H2-dependent CO2 fixation. Nickel containing enzymes of acetogens and methanogens include FeNi hydrogenase, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, acetyl-CoA synthase and, in methanogens, methyl-CoM reductase in the last step of methane synthesis. Several lines of evidence implicate the acetyl-CoA pathway as the most ancient pathway of CO2 fixation, most notably recent findings that the overall reaction of the enzymatic pathway from H2 (E0' = -414 mV) and CO2 to pyruvate can be replaced by Ni0 alone in water as the lone catalyst. Here we studied the ability of Ni0 to serve as catalyst and reductant for nonenzymatic redox reactions that require only a mild reductant, as the midpoint potential of Ni0 oxidation to Ni2+ is E0' = -260 mV. We show that Ni0 in water can convert 2-oxo acids to 2-hydroxy acids and, in the presence of NH3, to amino acids at 25-100C without addition of H2, and that it will function as catalyst and reductant for the fumarate reductase reaction. The findings expand the repertoire of ancient metabolic reactions that Ni0 can catalyze without proteins, cofactors, or sulfur, shedding light on the broad catalytic activity and substrate specificity of Ni0 at metabolic origin.",

    "title": "Atlas-Based Spatio-temporal MRI Phenotyping of 3D Fungal Spread in Grapevine Wood",
    "summary": "In perennial crops, inner wood degradation often escapes detection until irreversible damage has occurred. Grapevine trunk disease (GTD) is a well-known example in viticulture that alters plants from within, years before foliar symptoms arise, making early assessment difficult. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel non-destructive 3D + t pipeline for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) spatial quantification and monitoring of early internal tissue degradation resulting from fungal colonization. This pipeline integrates (i) anatomical alignment and rigid time-series registration of volumetric MRI scans, (ii) a generalized cylindrical coordinate transformation for cross-sectional trunk anatomy normalization, (iii) supervised classification to segment water-depleted (diseased/non-functional) regions, and (iv) population-level statistical analyses including construction of population mean images, probabilistic atlases of lesions, and 3D lesion descriptors. Applied to multiple Vitis vinifera cultivars inoculated with a fungal trunk pathogen, our approach enables time-lapse comparisons of cultivar and treatment in vivo. The results reveal consistent early degradation signals across individuals and cultivar-dependent lesion differences. By combining high-resolution MRI with advanced image processing and statistical atlas tools, this method provides a new paradigm for 3D plant phenotyping of internal disease progression. This methodological innovation allows non-invasive quantification of disease development and comparative assessment of host responses in woody plants, demonstrating its potential to advance understanding and management of GTDs.",

    "summary": "Obligate intracellular pathogenic bacteria belonging to the order Rickettsiales include several important emerging pathogens causing major health and economic impact to people, companion animals, and agricultural animals. Despite some recent progress, the lack of well-established genetic manipulation methods for diverse research applications remains a challenge. We recently reported the establishment of targeted mutagenesis methods to disrupt genes in Ehrlichia and Anaplasma species. Many essential genes in Ehrlichia chaffeensis are likely refractory to targeted mutagenesis, thus we developed a novel targeted mutational approach leading to the expression of antisense RNA to facilitate the knockdown of p28-Omp19 protein expression from ECH_1143. This gene was selected as its encoded protein is among the highly immunogenic proteins of E. chaffeensis and is likely essential for the pathogen. This method involved introducing a mutation at a distal genomic location within the E. chaffeensis genome to allow for generation of a 209 nucleotide-long antisense RNA segment complementary to ECH_1143 coding mRNA from the same gene promoter which was duplicated as part of the mutagenesis. The mutational strategy was designed to retain the surrounding genomic regions unaltered. The antisense knockdown version of E. chaffeensis resulted in a reduction of p28-Omp19 expression when compared to wild-type E. chaffeensis during its replication in a macrophage cell line, where the gene expression is known to occur. We anticipate that the antisense mutational strategy will be broadly applicable to facilitate investigating essential genes of obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens.",

    "title": "Structural basis of HSP90C, a highly active chloroplastic HSP90 chaperone from A. thaliana",
    "summary": "Chloroplasts are the main energy organelles in plants, primary through photosynthesis. Thereby, they are responsible for CO2 fixation and dioxygen production, which are essential for living species on Earth. To ensure these processes, numerous proteins encoded from the nuclear DNA need to be imported inside the chloroplast, and eventually to the thylakoids. Whereas the translocation systems from both chloroplastic and thylakoids membranes have been studied in recent years, the stromal route between these two membranes is largely unknown. Notably, the chloroplastic HSP90 (HSP90C) is likely to play an important role in this process, but its structure and molecular mechanisms remain to be unveiled. In this study, we used a combination of structural and biophysical approaches to elucidate the features of Arabidopsis thaliana's HSP90C. Principally, we found that HSP90C has a remarkably high ATPase activity among the HSP90 family proteins. Further investigation allowed us to pinpoint atypical mechanisms responsible for this high activity. First, the N-terminal cap is involved in a disulfide bond that accelerates the ATPase activity of HSP90C. Second, its C-terminal domain features an extension that is mandatory for its dimerization. Third, our crystal structures reveal a wide opening of the HSP90C's dimer with reduced intermonomeric interfaces. Lastly, we identified a helical switch which is required for HSP90C's high activity. Three of these four features are due to sequence signatures of HSP90C, which we found to be shared by most of green plants representatives. Our study provides first insights of HSP90C's non-canonical mechanisms, which will help in the understanding of processes related to protein import in the chloroplast.",

    "title": "High Recovery Stop-and-Go Extraction Tips Using Polytetrafluoroethylene Disks Embedded with Poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) Particles for Proteomics",
    "summary": "The stop-and-go extraction tip (StageTip) is widely used for peptide purification in bottom-up proteomics, yet the original 3M EmporeTM disk is no longer available, prompting the need to evaluate current alternatives. Two types of commercially available poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) (SDB)-containing polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) disks were used to fabricate StageTips. Desalting was performed on 500 ng and 20 ng of HeLa tryptic peptides, and the nanoLC/MS/MS results were compared. Both StageTips demonstrated equivalent performance for the 500 ng sample, but for the 20 ng sample, one StageTip identified 1.8 times more peptides, particularly longer and more hydrophobic peptides. Physical characterization and scanning electron microscope imaging of these disks revealed that the high-performing disk contains more PTFE fibers, partially covering the SDB particle surface. This likely prevents hydrophobic peptides from being trapped in small mesopores, improving recovery from low-input samples. These findings demonstrate that disk material properties critically influence performance in trace proteomics.",

    "title": "Invertebrate FAXC and Metaxin Proteins: Related Proteins with Distinct Features",
    "summary": "Structural features of FAXC proteins of invertebrates are examined in this report to further establish that invertebrate FAXCs are metaxin-like proteins. Invertebrate phyla that receive the most attention are Mollusca, Cnidaria, and Arthropoda. The results demonstrate that invertebrate FAXC proteins have structural homology to vertebrate and invertebrate metaxin proteins. However, pairwise alignments of amino acid sequences revealed only low percentages of amino acid identities, indicating that FAXC and metaxin proteins are distinct categories of proteins. Among the important criteria in identifying invertebrate FAXC proteins as metaxin-like was the presence of conserved protein domains: GST_N_Metaxin, GST_C_Metaxin, and Tom37. Another metaxin-like feature found with invertebrate FAXC proteins is a characteristic pattern of -helical and {beta}-strand segments. The four {beta}-strand segments form, in three dimensions, a planar {beta}-sheet motif that is a distinguishing characteristic of FAXC and metaxin proteins. Evolutionary relationships between FAXCs and metaxins were uncovered by phylogenetic analysis. Distinct but related evolutionary groups were found for invertebrate FAXCs and metaxins, as well as vertebrate FAXCs and metaxins. Invertebrate species can have multiple FAXC genes, and more than ten FAXC genes is not uncommon. The genes that are adjacent to different FAXC genes in the same invertebrate are typically not the same. Therefore, the genomic regions are generally not highly conserved for multiple FAXC genes. But, for invertebrates with a single FAXC gene, the same neighboring genes may be found for the FAXC genes of different but taxonomically related invertebrates. Honey bees and bumblebees are examples. For invertebrates with multiple FAXC genes, several of the genes may be in close proximity in the same genomic region, forming a cluster of FAXC genes.",

    "title": "Salmonella exploits USP32 to coordinate Rab14 and Rab11 recycling pathways for intracellular survival",
    "summary": "Many intracellular bacterial pathogens establish membrane-bound niches derived from host material to survive and replicate within host cells. These compartments are carved through subversion of host intracellular trafficking pathways to modulate the composition of the vacuolar membrane. Although recycling-associated small Rab GTPases are frequently observed at infection sites, their role in membrane remodeling and cargo sorting has remained poorly understood. Here, we leverage the extensive early membrane remodeling occurring during Salmonella infection to dissect this process. Using endogenously tagged cell lines, we characterize the dynamics of the recycling small GTPases Rab14 and Rab11 at Salmonella intracellular infection sites. We report that Rab14 recruits its effector Rufy1, which mediates sorting of CI-M6PR through recycling tubules. Subsequently, Rab11 disperses the newly formed recycling endosomes by interacting with its effector Fip3 for retrograde transport. This pathway is controlled by the deubiquitinating enzyme USP32, which targets both Rab14 and Rab11, enhancing their interactions with Rufy1 and Fip3, respectively. We further show that USP32 is recruited to the infection site via local enrichment of phosphatidylserine-positive membranes, a process triggered by the Salmonella effector proteins SopE/E2. Importantly, silencing USP32 significantly impairs intracellular bacterial survival. Our findings reveal a remarkable exploitation of host signaling and trafficking pathways by Salmonella to construct a pro-replicative niche. Targeting these pathways may offer new strategies for therapeutic intervention against intracellular bacterial infections.",

    "title": "First-in-Class Small Molecule ROBO2 Binders Identified through Integrated Virtual Screening and Biophysical Validation",
    "summary": "Roundabout homolog 2 (ROBO2) is a transmembrane receptor implicated in glioblastoma progression through its interaction with Slit2-mediated signaling pathways. Dysregulated Slit2-ROBO2 signaling enhances tumor cell migration, invasion, and tissue infiltration, while elevated ROBO2 levels contribute to an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment supporting GBM aggressiveness and highlighting ROBO2 as a therapeutic target. Despite its therapeutic relevance, no ROBO2-targeted small molecules have been reported. To address this gap, we performed a structure-based virtual screening campaign targeting ROBO2, followed by experimental validation with Dianthus TRIC platform and microscale thermophoresis (MST). Fifteen compounds were screened for ROBO2 binding, from which four candidates exhibited robust TRIC signals. Subsequent affinity measurements revealed that two small molecules, Z1334432986 and Z1692774161, bind ROBO2 in a reproducible concentration-dependent manner, with dissociation constants (Kd) of 40.8 M and 25.8 M, respectively. Molecular docking with validated hits revealed a shared ROBO2 binding pocket defined by conserved anchor residues (ASN354, SER366, ASP385) and accommodation of distinct ligand conformations within the ROBO2 binding pocket. This work establishes a screening pipeline for identifying ROBO2-targeted small molecules and lays the foundation for developing therapeutics aimed at disrupting Slit-ROBO2 signaling in GBM.",

Reaction of pyrrole-2-aldehyde with electron-deficient 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-meso-pentafluorophenyl and 1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-meso-4-nitrophenyl BODIPYs yields double condensation at the 1,7-methyl positions to give the corresponding bis(pyrrole) derivatives, whereas the electron-rich meso-tolyl analogue selectively undergoes single condensation at only one of the \u03b1-methyl groups under identical conditions. This substituent-dependent divergence extends to reactions with 1,9-diformyl-meso-aryl dipyrromethanes, enabling access to structurally distinct BODIPY\u2013DPM conjugates. Reaction of 1,9-diformyl-DPM with meso-tolyl BODIPY selectively yields acyclic monosubstituted BODIPY\u2013DPM conjugates, whereas the higher reactivity of meso-pentafluorophenyl BODIPY enables condensation between both 1,7-methyl groups and the two aldehyde functionalities of the diformyl-DPM scaffold, affording cyclic, porphyrin-like BODIPY\u2013DPM frameworks. Notably, meso-pentafluorophenyl BODIPYs also undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the para-fluorine atom by piperidine under the condensation conditions, as confirmed unambiguously by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The resulting BODIPY\u2013DPM and BODIPY\u2013pyrrole conjugates exhibit pronounced bathochromic shifts (90\u2013180 nm relative to parent BODIPYs), deep-red to near-infrared absorption (~670 nm) and emission (~750 nm), enlarged Stokes shifts, and strong intramolecular charge-transfer character. These features translate into efficient heavy-atom-free triplet formation, with singlet-oxygen quantum yields reaching up to 0.45.

    "title": "Efflux pump regulation and metabolic rewiring define the ceiling of efflux-mediated drug resistance in Mycobacteria",
    "summary": "Multidrug-resistant efflux pumps play a critical role in antimicrobial resistance, yet the physiological limits of their overexpression remain poorly understood. While gene amplifications and regulatory mutations commonly drive this overexpression, these pumps remain transcriptionally inactive under normal cellular conditions due to their high energetic cost, making it challenging to assess their full impact on resistance evolution and the maximum attainable minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). To delineate the extent and spectrum of efflux-based resistance, we subjected Mycobacterium smegmatis mc{superscript 2}155(Msm) wild-type and efflux pump-deleted strains ({Delta}lfrA and {Delta}efpA) to adaptive laboratory evolution in the presence of a broad-spectrum efflux substrate ethidium bromide (EtBr). Despite prolonged selection, resistance plateaued at 8-16x MIC, revealing an intrinsic ceiling to efflux-based adaptation. Evolved populations integrated multiple layers of adaptation: enhanced efflux kinetics, reduced intracellular EtBr accumulation, and mutations spanning global regulators, ribosomal genes, and membrane components. Notably, deletion of specific pumps ({Delta}lfrA) triggered compensatory upregulation of alternative efflux systems, highlighting functional redundancy. Beyond efflux activation, evolved strains exhibited metabolic reprogramming, including downregulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and upregulation of lipid biosynthesis and {beta}-oxidation, which altered NAD+/NADH homeostasis and membrane potential. Extending this adaptive evolution approach to Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra (Mtb)demonstrated that these adaptive constraints and metabolic alterations are conserved across mycobacterial species. Together, these results uncover fundamental limits to efflux evolution and reveal how bacteria integrate regulatory and metabolic plasticity to maximize drug resistance. Targeting these interconnected networks may offer a powerful strategy to contain the rise of multidrug resistance.",

    "summary": "Introduction: Affordable tools for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection could support drug development and early intervention. Subtle motor changes may indicate preclinical AD, but hand response selection and initiation speeds are understudied. This study assessed whether unsupervised, online visuomotor reaction time (RT) tests relate to subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), a validated high risk state for future conversion to AD Methods: A total of 910 participants (age 66.3 +/- 7.5, 70.8% female) completed assessments of simple and choice visuomotor RT tests at home as part of the online TAS Test protocol; they also completed the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) episodic memory and executive function tests. Among them, 142 participants reported SCI. Results: On the TAS Test visuomotor tests, SCI was associated with 8.4% [1.4%, 15.4%] longer RT ( (p = .008; adjusted for task complexity), greater odds of time-out failure (OR = 1.35 [1.01, 1.81]; p = .037), and greater variance in RT (log-variance (SCI - comparison) = .094 [.028, .159]; p < .001). There were no significant differences between the SCI and comparison groups on any of the CANTAB tests. After adjusting for SCI status, none of the CANTAB tests were significantly associated with RT. Discussion: SCI was associated with longer and more variable visuomotor RT, and greater odds of time-out failure, while not being associated with tests of memory and executive function. Cognitive test scores did not explain a significant amount of variance in visuomotor RT. Taken together, these results support a hypothesis that people with SCI may be experiencing earlier visuomotor deficits that are distinct from (or precede) decline in episodic memory and executive function. Visuomotor tasks that record RT may be more sensitive to preclinical manifestations of cognitive decline than more traditional tests of cognitive function.",

This limits our ability to gain a thorough view of how the microbiome impacts health and disease. Here we introduce BiomeGPT, a transformer-based foundation model pretrained on over 13,300 human gut metagenomes spanning 32 phenotypes, including healthy and 31 diverse diseases, to learn context-aware, species-level gut microbiome representations. The model captures quantitative compositional structure and intricate cross-species dependencies embedded within community profiles. When fine-tuned for predicting host health status, BiomeGPT accurately distinguishes healthy from diseased microbiomes and resolves individual disease states across a broad clinical spectrum. Furthermore, its attention patterns reveal biologically plausible microbial signatures, highlighting both shared and disease-specific microbial species linked to host phenotypes. By providing a unified, scalable framework for species-level gut microbiome representation learning and prediction, BiomeGPT enables new avenues for biomarker discovery, disease stratification, and microbiome-driven precision medicine.",

    "title": "PRADA-DTI: A Prototype-Retrieval Augmented Domain-Adaptation Framework for Drug-Target Interaction Prediction",
    "summary": "Drug target interaction (DTl) prediction is a fundamental task in computational drug discovery. However, most existing DTI models assume a static learning environment, whereas real-world biomedical data are dynamic, characterized by the continuous emergence of new protein families and interaction patterns. This poses major challenges for model generalization and continual adaptation, especially under privacy and data-access constraints. To address these issues, we introduce PRADA-DTI, a retrieval-augmented, parameter-efficient framework for domain-incremental DTI learning. Built on a shared physicochemical backbone, PRADADTI learns domain-specialized prompts for representation-level modulation, coupled with LowRank Adaptation (LoRA) modules for parameter-space adaptation. At inference, protein embeddings query a compact prototype memory without storing raw molecular data, retrieving similar domains to dynamically compose the relevant prompts and LoRA parameters without requiring domain labels. This retrieval-guided composition enables continual learning from new protein domains while mitigating catastrophic forgetting on previous ones. On BindingDB and BIOSNAP benchmarks, PRADA-DTI substantially outperforms state-of-the-art continual learning and parameter-efficient baselines in both predictive accuracy and forgetting mitigation with minimal parameter updates. Interpretability analysis through residue-level attribution visualization demonstrates that the model correctly attends to binding pocket regions across different protein domains, confirming that the retrieval-guided adaptation mechanism captures biologically relevant structural patterns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of retrieval augmented parameter adaptation for continual drug discovery.",

    "summary": "Insects rely on plants\u2019 visual, chemical, tactile, and electrical cues when making various decisions. A recent study demonstrated that dehydrated plants emit ultrasonic sounds within the auditory sensitivity range of many moth species. In this study, we sought to determine whether insects also rely on plant acoustic signals when making decisions. We investigated whether female moths rely on ultrasonic clicks which are typically produced by dehydrated plants when deciding where to oviposit. In the absence of an actual plant, the moths indeed preferred to lay their eggs in proximity to acoustic signals which represent dehydrating plants. Tracking the moths\u2019 behavior prior to the decision showed that they examined both sides of the arena and gradually spent more time on the acoustic-playback side. Interestingly, when actual plants were added to the arena, the oviposition preference was reversed and the moths preferred silent plants, which is in accordance with their a priori preference for hydrated plants. Deafening the moths eliminated their preference, confirming that the choice was based on hearing. Moreover, the presence of male moths, including their auditory signals, did not affect their oviposition decision, suggesting that the response was specific to plant sound emissions. We reveal evidence for a first acoustic interaction between moths and plants, but as plants emit various sounds, our findings hint at the existence of more currently unknown insect-plant acoustic interactions.",

    "title": "Population analyses reveal heterogenous encoding in the medial prefrontal cortex during naturalistic foraging",
    "summary": "Foraging in the wild requires coordinated switching of critical functions, including goal-oriented navigation and context-appropriate action selection. Nevertheless, few studies have examined how different functions are represented in the brain during naturalistic foraging. To address this question, we recorded multiple single-unit activities from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats seeking a sucrose reward in the presence of an unpredictable attack posed by a robotic predator (Lobsterbot). Simultaneously recorded ensemble activities from neurons were analyzed in reference to various behavioral indices as the animal moved freely across the foraging area (F) between the nest (N) and the goal (E) area. An artificial neural network, trained with simultaneously recorded neural activity, estimated the rat\u2019s current distance from the Lobsterbot. The accuracy of distance estimation was the highest in the middle F-zone in which the dominant behavior was active navigation. The spatial encoding persisted in the N-zone when non-navigational behaviors such as grooming, rearing, and sniffing were excluded. In contrast, the accuracy decreased as the animal approached the E-zone, when the activity of the same neuronal ensembles was more correlated with events related to dynamic decision-making between food procurement and Lobsterbot evasion. A population-wide analysis confirmed highly heterogeneous encoding by the region. To further assess the decision-related activity in the E-zone, a naive Bayesian classifier was trained to predict the success and failure of avoidance behavior. The classifier predicted the avoidance outcome as much as 6 s before the head withdrawal. In addition, two sub-populations of recorded units with distinct temporal dynamics contributed differently to the prediction. These findings suggest that an overlapping population of mPFC neurons may switch between two heterogeneous modes, encoding relevant locations for goal-directed navigation or an imminent situational challenge.",

    "title": "Synaptation - a missing concept in the science of evolved complexity",
    "summary": "The concept of synaptation is introduced to explain how natural selection can generate complex, higher-level traits in collectives that lack a shared inheritance mechanism. The traditional approach, based on Lewontin's \"recipe\" for natural selection, excludes such emergent traits from the adaptation-exaptation taxonomy. Yet individual organism fitness is often mediated by collective, non-linear interactions within systems that cannot themselves sustain heredity. To address this, multilevel selection (MLS) theory is extended in the form of synaptive MLS, a process through which heterogeneous task groups evolve emergent traits, called synaptations, via irreducible, non-additive cross-level selective covariance. Synaptive MLS differs from trait-group selection because collective function depends on causal entanglement among heterogenous entities with diverse fates, rather than a common trait that links entities to a shared fate. This framework applies to conspecific divisions of labor, multi-species consortia and holobiont integration, where coordination of distinct roles yields emergent fitness effects. Synaptation recognizes how natural selection can contribute to emergent functions by coordinating adaptive, exaptive, and neutral organism-level traits whose lower-level roles scaffold higher-level selected effects. Synaptation and adaptation define the endpoints of a continuum of selected-effect complexity. Recognition of this continuum extends the Darwinian paradigm to adaptive complexity in systems that fail classical heredity requirements and offers an evolutionary lens for understanding relational phenomena such as eubiosis, dysbiosis, and rebiosis in holobionts.",

    "title": "Learning a PRECISE language for small-molecule binding",
    "summary": "Virtual screening of billion-scale compound libraries has become feasible through machine learning approaches. In particular, CoNCISE (RECOMB 2025) introduced drug quantization via codebooks, achieving highly scalable and accurate binary predictions. However, drug discovery requires understanding not just whether molecules bind, but where they bind and how to target specific sites. Here, we present PRECISE which leverages CoNCISE's quantized small-molecule representations while operating on the target's 3D structure as its input. The key innovation of PRECISE is reimagining drug-target interaction as compatibility between quantized drug embeddings and a latent representation of the target's surface mesh, enriched with electrostatic and geometric features. PRECISE designs a novel surface representation, interpreted through a geometric deep learning architecture, enabling it to identify binding sites more accurately than state-of-the-art methods (DiffDock-L, Chai, and Boltz-2) while the codebook ensures billion-scale screening capability. Our formulation unlocks zero-shot generalization to complex targets such as metalloproteins and multi-chain complexes. To enable efficient integration with downstream docking workflows, we introduce PRECISE-MCTS, which combines fast PRECISE-based screening with selective Vina docking through an iterative Monte Carlo Tree Search approach. By providing both mechanistic understanding and massive scalability, PRECISE delivers capabilities that were previously mutually exclusive in virtual screening.",

    "title": "Proteins as Statistical Languages: Information-Theoretic Signatures of Proteomes Across the Tree of Life",
    "summary": "Protein sequences are commonly interpreted through biochemical and evolutionary lenses, emphasizing structure-function relationships and selection in sequence space. Here we develop a complementary viewpoint: proteins as statistical languages, strings over a finite alphabet generated by constrained stochastic processes. We formalize intrinsic informational descriptors of protein ensembles, including composition entropy H1, adjacent mutual information I1, and separation-dependent information profiles Id. A null-model ladder (uniform, composition-matched i.i.d., and Markov-1) separates compositional effects from genuine positional dependence. We then evaluate these descriptors empirically across 20 UniProt reference proteomes spanning major clades, using protein-level bootstrap resampling and matched synthetic controls. Real proteomes consistently depart from composition-matched i.i.d. baselines and exhibit information profiles that remain elevated beyond the decay expected under first-order Markov surrogates, indicating dependencies beyond local transition statistics. Finally, a compressibility proxy (gzip) provides an orthogonal signature of redundancy relative to i.i.d. controls at matched composition. Together, these results support the view of proteomes as constrained statistical languages and provide model-agnostic fingerprints for comparing sequence ensembles. These signatures provide a lightweight diagnostic layer for comparing proteomes prior to mechanistic modeling.",

    "title": "Distinct mechanisms drive post-antibiotic Tuberculosis relapse post-cure versus post-treatment-failure",
    "summary": "Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health concern, as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infects a quarter of the world's population. Though many TB patients sterilize infection with treatment regimens including the current standard, incomplete sterilization leads to post-treatment relapse and development of drug resistance. Two mechanisms have been hypothesized as driving relapse: persistence, where treatment kills all replicating Mtb, and relapse follows once non-replicating Mtb return to a replicative niche; and threshold, where replicating Mtb remain alive, yet below detectable levels. Relapse is often detected through a combination of clinical and bacteriological testing, often clinically described as recurrence of TB <2 years after a \"cure\" diagnosis, while many experimental studies examine relapse ~2-months after treatment completion. Our capacity to untangle these considerations and identify mechanisms driving relapse in vivo are limited. Here, we examine the impact of both threshold and persistence mechanisms on relapse post-treatment completion and post-cure diagnosis using our computational model capturing whole-host Mtb infection dynamics. Simulations show that erroneous TB-negative diagnosis post-treatment (false cure) rates are regimen-specific, specifically, the historic standard HRZE is more likely to result in false cure than the contemporary regimens RMZE or BPaL. We also identify how threshold-driven or persistence-driven relapse correlates with both pre-treatment bacterial burden and diagnostic tests used at treatment completion. Simulations show that post-cure relapse is almost exclusively persistence driven, while threshold-driven relapse is most common without a \"cured\" inclusion criterion. Thus, for patients with negative bacteriological diagnostic results at treatment completion, subsequent relapse may best be personalized by targeting non-replicating Mtb.",

    "title": "Operational Accessibility Isomorphism Between Spectral Damping and Neuromodulatory Gating",
    "summary": "This paper formally defines an operational isomorphism between spectral damping in molecular vibronic systems and neuromodulatory control in biological sensory systems. Without asserting causal continuity or physical identity across scales, we show that both domains instantiate the same class of output-selective control structures, characterized by non-monotonic modulation and bounded state accessibility. Within a minimal operational framework, damping is shown to function not as loss or noise, but as a selector of accessible outputs, leading to effective reductions in observable state spaces under parametric control. This perspective clarifies how neuromodulatory phenomena commonly described as gain modulation cannot, in general, be reduced to monotonic gain models, but instead reflect accessibility-based control. The proposed isomorphism is explicitly limited, falsifiable, and non-metaphorical, establishing a principled bridge between molecular spectroscopy and perceptual neuroscience without invoking consciousness, representation, or subjective experience.",

    "title": "Molecular Selectivity of Damping-Induced Spectral Amplification",
    "summary": "Environmental damping in molecular spectroscopy is commonly treated as a phenomenological source of decoherence and spectral broadening, leading to a monotonic reduction of spectral intensity. Here we show that this assumption is not generally valid. Using a vibronically resolved response-function framework, we demonstrate that for certain molecular vibronic structures, intermediate damping can enhance observable spectral intensity through redistribution of vibronic interference, without any increase in total oscillator strength. The peak intensity exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on damping strength, characterized by a finite optimal value. This behavior is not universal. Weakly coupled systems lack sufficient spectral overlap to support redistribution, whereas strongly coupled systems exhibit destructive interference due to excessive vibronic density, leading to monotonic suppression. These results indicate that damping can act as a structural selector of spectral accessibility rather than as a purely degradative loss mechanism and clarify the molecular conditions under which environmental coupling reshapes spectroscopic observables.",

    "title": "Theoretical Framework for Absolute Quantification in Digital Immunoassays and Advancements in Microfluidic-Free Droplet-Based Digital Immunoassay Methodologies",
    "summary": "Current single-molecule immunoassays primarily rely on Poisson distribution models, which have limitations in achieving absolute quantification of target proteins. To address this, we developed a novel mathematical model that treats the capture of target proteins by magnetic beads as a discrete Poisson process, while the subsequent washing and secondary sampling steps are modeled using a hypergeometric distribution. Based on this combined distribution model, we constructed a new theoretical framework for digital immunoassays and proposed a calibration\u2011curve\u2011free absolute quantification method based on micro\u2011volume calculation. To validate the feasibility of this model, we established a digital immunoassay platform using a water\u2011in\u2011oil magnetic bead system without the need for complex microfluidic devices. This approach not only eliminates reliance on traditional calibration curves but also demonstrates enhanced feasibility and a broader dynamic range compared to existing methods such as Single Molecule Immunoassays and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassays. Additionally, it allows for the determination of the binding efficiency and accurate blank coefficients of the detection system. Furthermore, the potential application of an internal calibration method within this system is explored. The proposed theoretical framework offers a new strategy to address the challenge of absolute quantification in protein immunoassays, provides important insights for advancing protein quantification methodologies, and supports the development of more precise detection techniques. It is expected to expand the application of digital immunoassays in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",

We identify Src-like adaptor protein (SLAP), a negative regulator of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, as a key suppressor of SFK activity in the colon. Constitutive and inducible epithelial-specific Slap deletion using a villin-CreERT2 model increases CEC proliferation and accelerates tumorigenesis in the azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS) model. Slap deficiency also enhances SFK-dependent expansion of normal and tumor-derived colonic organoids. Mechanistically, we identify the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB2, an upstream activator of SFKs and CEC proliferation, as an additional SLAP-regulated target. Together, these findings reveal a non-genetic mechanism by which SFKs drive colonic transformation and establish SLAP as a tumor suppressor that constrains oncogenic SFK signaling in the colonic epithelium.",

    "summary": "The yeast cell wall is a highly dynamic and multifunctional structure that is essential for maintaining cellular integrity, protecting against environmental stresses, and enabling adhesion, signaling, and interactions with the surrounding environment. Its chemical composition and organization are strongly influenced by external factors such as temperature, pH, nutrient availability and their delivery mode. In batch culture systems, yeast cells grow in a closed environment with limited nutrients, leading to well-defined growth phases that reflect major metabolic transitions. While global proteomic changes during these phases have been described, the temporal regulation of cell wall protein (CWP) expression remains insufficiently characterized. In this study, the temporal remodeling of the cell wall proteome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288c was examined during batch cultivation in rich medium over 24 hours. A classical proteomics workflow was applied to analyze CWPs from samples collected at multiple time points over the cultivation period. The analysis revealed substantial qualitative and quantitative changes in CWPs expression linked to metabolic shifts between growth phases. Proteins involved in cell wall remodeling and glycoprotein biosynthesis were particularly enriched at the initial sampling point (b-T0h), corresponding to the transition from flask cultivation to bioreactor conditions, and overall CWP abundance was highest during this early growth stage. Time-resolved quantitative, transcription factor, and functional enrichment analyses revealed coordinated regulation of cell wall adaptation. Stationary-phase specific protein markers linked to glucose depletion were identified, offering insight into nutrient-limited remodeling. Comparisons with previous studies showed variability driven by strain differences, culture conditions, and methodological approaches.",

    "title": "Fluorescence based microviscosity mapping in membraneless organelles",
    "summary": "Membraneless organelles (MLOs) are cellular biomolecular condensates formed by liquid-liquid phase separation. Their biological functions are intimately linked to their material properties including viscosity. Condensate viscosity is determined by the size, shape, concentration and molecular interactions between MLOs components. It impacts the diffusion of MLOs constituents and the selective permeability of the condensate, thereby regulating the rate of biochemical reactions. Viscosity modifications associated with liquid-to-gel transition of the condensates are related to pathologies. Current experimental approaches for characterizing the material properties of cellular condensates remain limited. In this study, we report the use of BODIPY-based molecular rotors, in combination with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), to monitor the microviscosity of cellular MLOs directly in living cells. The fluorescence lifetime of BODIPY derivatives increases with the viscosity of their microenvironment, enabling quantitative assessment of microviscosity within condensates. HaloTag technology was employed to specifically label MLO components. Our findings reveal that the nucleolus exhibits higher viscosity than the surrounding nucleoplasm and that microviscosity varies across nucleolar sub-compartments. Furthermore, nucleolar reorganization induced by inhibition of rRNA synthesis results in a measurable increase in microviscosity. Finally, we demonstrate that the microviscosity of stress granules is lower than that of the nucleolus. Overall, presented results demonstrate the strong potential of the BODIPY based molecular rotors as a versatile and powerful tools for probing the material properties of cellular MLOs.",

    "title": "Basement membrane turnover drives filopodial protease-independent invasion",
    "summary": "The basement membrane is a specialised nanoporous extracellular matrix mainly composed of collagen IV fibres and laminins. As collagen IV fibres form covalent cross-links, cells cannot freely cross it. Basement membrane breaching marks the transition from in situ to invasive carcinoma, commonly attributed to protease activity. Yet, recent data show that tumour cells can cross basement membranes through protease-independent mechanisms. Experimental evidence suggests that filopodia can play an active role in pore enlargement in extracellular matrices by generating plastic mechanical deformation. Moreover, plasticity can be regulated by covalent cross-link concentration, which we hypothesise can be responsive to collagen IV turnover, thus generating transient weak spots. To test this, we developed a quantitative, biophysical mathematical model describing the interaction between a tumour-cell cluster and a basement membrane using relevant biological assumptions and parameters. The cluster is represented as an evolving, energetic surface and the basement membrane is described as a set of points representing active and inactive links. Simulations show that synchronisation of collagen IV turnover coupled with filopodium extension drives pore enlargement, providing a mechanistic basis for protease-independent invasion. Consistent with experiments, simulations identify two complementary filopodium groups: one driving global degradation and the other promoting local pore enlargement.",

    "title": "A Genome-Wide Genetic Screen Identifies a Novel kDNA Replication Protein in Trypanosomes",
    "summary": "Trypanosomatid parasites cause diverse diseases in humans and their livestock, but share a unique biological feature, the organization of mitochondrial DNA into a complex structure, named kinetoplast (kDNA), which is crucial for the survival of the parasites. Replication, segregation and expression of kDNA are highly complex processes that involve an estimated ~300 proteins, only a fraction of which have been identified and characterized. Here, we report the development of an unbiased genetic screen in the experimental model Trypanosoma brucei to identify novel factors involved in kDNA maintenance. Our approach uses a combination of genome-wide RNA interference, a novel kDNA staining protocol, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Of the 20 highest-ranked genes identified, six are known kDNA maintenance factors. One hit, Tb927.8.4240, a gene of previously unknown function, was selected for experimental validation and follow-up. Ultrastructure expansion microscopy using a tagged version of the protein reveals a dynamic localization during the cell cycle. RNAi-mediated ablation of Tb927.8.4240 results in the progressive but incomplete loss of kDNA, with only a minor effect on the tripartite attachment complex, suggesting the protein is involved in kDNA replication but not segregation. The growth phenotype of Tb927.8.4240 ablation is fully rescued in a kDNA-independent genetic background, confirming a specific role in kDNA replication.",

    "title": "Mechanistic insights into chromatin modulation by the orphan remodeler ATRX",
    "summary": "Alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked protein (ATRX) is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler that performs diverse functions, including spacing nucleosomes, facilitating the deposition of histone variant H3.3, and preventing replication stress. The mechanism by which ATRX modulates chromatin is unknown. Here, our cryo-EM structure revealed that ATRX recognizes and modulates the nucleosome through its C-terminal regions by embracing and unwrapping ~18 base-pair nucleosomal DNA near the entry/exit sites in the presence of ADP-BeF3. Strikingly, the DNA minor groove between SHL6 and SHL7 is profoundly deformed by a pin-like structure in ATRX, which uniquely intercalates the aromatic side chain of a phenylalanine into the base stackings. Biochemical assays revealed the crucial role of this phenylalanine in sliding the nucleosome without affecting the ATPase activity. Such a pin-like structure mimics a foot-step on the DNA ladder, which differentiates ATRX from other remodelers. To translocate the DNA on the nucleosome, two more features, including a disordered insertion that contacts the histone surface and a positively charged loop bridging the cross-gyre interactions, serve as essential anchors for the nucleosome modulation by ATRX. Together, we propose a climbing model for how ATRX mobilizes the DNA upon ATP hydrolysis.",

    "title": "CCDC32 stabilizes clathrin-coated pits and drives their invagination",
    "summary": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is essential for maintaining homeostasis in mammalian cells. Previous studies have reported more than 50 CME accessory proteins; however, the mechanism driving the invagination of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) remains elusive. We show by quantitative live cell imaging that siRNA-mediated knockdown of CCDC32, a poorly characterized endocytic accessory protein, leads to the accumulation of unstable flat clathrin assemblies. CCDC32 interacts with the \u03b1-appendage domain (AD) of AP2 in vitro and with full-length AP2 complexes in cells. Deletion of aa78-98 in CCDC32, corresponding to a predicted \u03b1-helix, abrogates AP2 binding and CCDC32\u2019s early function in CME. Furthermore, clinically observed nonsense mutations in CCDC32, which result in C-terminal truncations that lack aa78-98, are linked to the development of cardio-facio-neuro-developmental syndrome (CFNDS). Overall, our data demonstrate the function of a novel endocytic accessory protein, CCDC32, in regulating CCP stabilization and invagination, critical early stages of CME.",

    "summary": "Halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) possess outstanding optical properties for display technologies, but their commercial use is limited by surface defects and poor environmental stability. In this work, we introduce hydroxyl-terminated polystyrene (PS\u2013OH) as a bifunctional ligand incorporated directly during CsPbBr3 PQD synthesis. The terminal -OH groups provide strong coordination to under-coordinated Pb2+ sites, suppressing non-radiative recombination, while the polystyrene backbone forms a protective hydrophobic shell. This dual action leads to substantially enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield and substantially improved resistance to moisture-induced degradation. When used as a color-conversion layer on top of blue LEDs, the PS\u2013OH modified PQDs enable more efficient photon down-conversion and improved device-level performance. These results demonstrate that functionalized polymers, employed as in-situ ligands, offer a powerful approach for stabilizing and enhancing brightness of perovskite quantum dots for advanced optoelectronic applications.",

    "summary": "Light-driven hydrogen evolution is a promising strategy for solar fuel production. While numerous systems for molecular photocatalysis exist, their implementation into reusable soft materials remains challenging due to catalyst leaching, solubility issues, and limited structural integration. Here, we report the first hydrogel system in which a molecular photocatalyst is covalently embedded as crosslinker. Using a bipyridine- annulated perylene dye bearing terminal alkene groups, we employ thiol-ene click chemistry to incorporate the dye into a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based hydrogel network. Post-synthetic platinum coordination yields \u201cDyedrogels\u201d \u2013 mechanically robust hydrogels of varying shape that retain their photocatalytic functionality under visible-light irradiation in pure water, without any solubilizing additives. Structural and optical characterization confirms a homogeneous distribution of the catalyst, while indicating only negligible platinum leaching. Despite moderate hydrogen evolution turnover numbers (TON = 0.03), the stability, modularity, and reusability of this platform underscore its value as a device-like material for future flow-reactor designs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a photocatalytically active hydrogel in which the molecular catalyst itself constitutes a covalent crosslink within the polymer network.",

    "title": "Red-Emitting NDI-Embedded Nanohoop as a Solution-Processable Emitter for Mechanically Reconfigurable Inorganic EL Devices",
    "summary": "Nanohoops with radial \u03c0-conjugation, such as cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs), exhibit intrinsically large Stokes shifts arising from excited-state symmetry breaking. However, their integration into functional electroluminescent platforms has remained virtually unexplored. Herein, we report the synthesis of a three-fold symmetric naphthalenediimide (NDI)-embedded CPP analogue and its application in inorganic powder electroluminescence (iEL) devices. The incorporation of electron-accepting NDI units extends the emission into the red region (\u03bbem = 632 nm, \u03a6F = 22%, in CHCl\u2083) with a large Stokes shift of 138 nm (4420 cm\u207b\u00b9), which is advantageous for suppressing self-absorption.

    "summary": "Ternary transition metal oxides (TTMOs) have emerged as a new class of electrode materials for high-performance energy storage systems, particularly supercapacitors (SCs) and hybrid battery-capacitor devices. This comprehensive review aims to comprehensively survey recent advances in the design, synthesis, and analysis of TTMOs-based nanostructures for supercapacitor (SC) electrodes. It begins by outlining the key concepts related to charge storage mechanisms in SC electrodes, electric double-layer capacitance (EDL), pseudocapacitive (PC), and battery-type (BT) behavior, followed by a clarification of device configurations, including symmetric SC (SSC), asymmetric SC (ASC), and hybrid SC (HSC) devices. This review then examines the fabrication strategies for TTMOs, emphasizing the impact of synthetic approaches on material morphology, crystallinity, and electrochemical performance. Special attention is given to the structure-property relationships that govern ion transport and charge storage dynamics in these materials. The influence of morphological features, including dimensionality, porosity, and hierarchical architecture, on electrochemical behavior is critically analyzed. A comparative evaluation of electrochemical matrices across various TTMO electrodes is presented, highlighting key performance and challenges. Ultimately, the review highlights emerging trends, current limitations, and future research directions that are poised to accelerate the development of next-generation TTMO materials for advanced energy storage technologies.",

    "summary": "Nanohoops with radial \u03c0-conjugation, such as cycloparaphenylenes (CPPs), exhibit intrinsically large Stokes shifts arising from excited-state symmetry breaking. However, their integration into functional electroluminescent platforms has remained virtually unexplored. Herein, we report the synthesis of a three-fold symmetric naphthalenediimide (NDI)-embedded CPP analogue and its application in inorganic powder electroluminescence (iEL) devices. The incorporation of electron-accepting NDI units extends the emission into the red region (\u03bbem = 632 nm, \u03a6F = 22%, in CHCl\u2083) with a large Stokes shift of 138 nm (4420 cm\u207b\u00b9), which is advantageous for suppressing self-absorption.

    "title": "Tunable Gelation and Viscoelasticity of Lung-Tissue\u2013Mimetic Sealant: Linking Shear History to In Situ Mechanical Performance through Physics-Informed Machine Learning",
    "summary": "Hydrogel-based lung sealants are optimized largely based on formulation and post-cure mechanics, even though deformation history during delivery and placement plays a critical, yet under-characterized, role in determining in situ performance. This disconnect is particularly consequential on the application of lung sealants, where excessive stiffness promotes delamination while insufficient stiffness compromises airtight sealing. Here, we establish a quantitative process\u2013structure\u2013property framework for a gelatin\u2013tannic acid\u2013transglutaminase lung-mimetic sealant by integrating time-resolved rheology with physics-informed machine learning.\n\nUsing small-amplitude oscillatory shear and steady torsional flow at 37 \u00b0C, we show that gelation follows a reproducible kinetic clock (storage modulus, G\u2032\u2013 loss modulus, G\u2033, crossover at ~100 s; modulus plateau by ~600 s), while the attainable viscoelastic state is strongly governed by deformation history. Increasing oscillatory strain amplitude from 0.1 % to 50 % suppresses network maturation, reducing the post-gelation storage modulus, G\u2032,  from ~10\u2076 to ~10\u2074 Pa, whereas sustained steady shear (0.01\u20131 s\u207b\u00b9) decreases magnitude of complex viscosity by 2\u20133 orders of magnitude and permanently downshifts elastic moduli, G\u2032\u2013, from \u22483.5\u00d710\u00b3 to \u22484\u00d710\u00b2 Pa. These modulus ranges span the effective compliance of lung parenchyma under physiological tidal strain, delineating mechanical regimes associated with airtight sealing, strain accommodation, or premature interfacial failure. Controlled aeration during the processing of the sealant further decreases stiffness by ~30 % without altering gelation kinetics, providing an additional, physically interpretable compliance-tuning mechanism.\n\nTo unify these effects, we introduce a dimensionless Degree of Gelation (DoG), serving as a rheological state variable that collapses oscillatory and steady-shear histories into a single, time-resolved descriptor of network evolution. Machine-learning models trained on experimentally accessible inputs (time, strain amplitude, shear rate, frequency, aeration) accurately predict DoG (R\u00b2 \u2248 0.9) and, in inverse mode, identify handling conditions required to achieve targeted in situ mechanical states.\n\nThis rheology\u2013machine-learning framework reframes lung sealant development from a static materials optimization problem to a controllable, process-driven design strategy. By quantitatively linking applicator-level parameters to failure-relevant mechanical outcomes\u2014airtightness, compliance, and resistance to delamination\u2014it provides a mechanistic and generalizable foundation for the design of injectable hydrogels, bioadhesives, and tissue-interfacing",

    "title": "Blue amine hydrates as a novel strategy for partitioning CO2",
    "summary": "We report a novel CO2 capture and separation principle based on the unexpected formation of CO2-loaded amine hydrates. Unlike conventional amine scrubbing, which relies on energy-intensive thermal regeneration, our approach utilizes a phase change driven by cooling. We discovered that various bifunctional amines, upon capturing CO2 in aqueous solutions containing tetrahydrofuran (THF), are structurally incorporated into the hydrate crystal lattice. This phenomenon was unequivocally confirmed via solid-state NMR and FTIR spectroscopy, with some hydrates exhibiting a distinct blue coloration. This phase separation facilitates partial dehydration and the partitioning of CO2-loaded amines into the solid phase, effectively reducing the working solution\u2019s heat capacity. Scalability was successfully demonstrated in a 150-mL system under ambient pressure. These findings establish a new regime in amine-CO2-water chemistry, offering a \u201ccooling-based\u201d fractionation strategy to significantly lower the energy penalty of carbon capture processes.",

    "title": "TubercuProbe: A Cross-Attention Graph-Sequence Model for Cross-Species Chemoproteomic Discovery in Mycobacterium tuberculosis",
    "summary": "Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) and residue-specific chemoproteomics have transformed human chemical biology, yet applying these approaches to pathogens remains limited by biosafety constraints, low throughput, and the absence of reusable atlases. We present TubercuProbe, a cross-species machine learning framework that leverages large-scale human chemoproteomic knowledge to prioritize compound-protein interactions in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and other pathogens. Our model integrates a graph isomorphism network (GINE) for ligand encoding with frozen ESM-C (600M) protein embeddings via bidirectional cross-attention. Trained on >2M ChEMBL compound-protein pairs (predominantly human targets), TubercuProbe achieves R2=0.77 (MSE=0.45) for continuous affinity prediction and transfers effectively to binary cysteine reactivity prediction (CysDB AUPRC=0.63). Ablation studies reveal that pretrained features are highly transferable across freezing strategies ({triangleup}AUPRC<0.03), suggesting the model captures fundamental protein-molecule interaction patterns. As a case study, we prioritize cysteine-reactive electrophiles and molecular glues for three Mtb virulence proteins (PtpB, SapM, Rv3671c), providing candidate probes for prospective ABPP validation. Orthogonal comparison with Boltz-2 structure predictions shows moderate correlation (Pearson r{approx}0.69). TubercuProbe provides a lightweight, sequence-driven first-pass ranker that enables pre-experimental prioritization - reducing the time, cost, and experimental burden of chemoproteomic discovery in biosafety-restricted systems. We discuss extensions toward multitask learning that jointly predicts non-covalent binding and covalent reactivity, recognizing that effective covalent probes must both reach their target and react once there.",

    "title": "Discovery of \u03b2-Sheet Peptide Assembly Codes via an Experimentally Validated Predictive Computational Platform",
    "summary": "Deciphering the sequence codes governing ordered peptide assemblies remains challenging due to the need to explore vast sequence space with atomic resolution. Here, we present an experimentally validated computational framework combining hybrid-resolution molecular dynamics and machine learning for the discovery of \u03b2-sheet-rich amyloid-forming peptides. Through exhaustive simulations of all 8,000 tripeptides, we demonstrate that the widely used aggregation propensity (AP) is not effective in predicting \u03b2-sheet assembly. We introduce Amyloid-Like Tendency (ALT), a metric enabled by our hybrid-resolution simulations that effectively identifies cross-\u03b2 architectures. Leveraging this physics-informed dataset, we further fine-tuned the Uni-Mol model to efficiently screen 160,000 tetrapeptides. Experimental validation of 46 candidates confirmed a predictive accuracy of ~85%, yielding 26 novel amyloid-forming peptides, including multiple hydrogelators. Mechanistic analysis reveals that specific sidechain stacking and central amino acid identity, beyond generic hydrophobicity, dictate ordered assembly. This establishes a scalable pipeline for the targeted design of functional peptide materials.",

    "summary": "Aggregate science, which studies how molecular aggregates exhibit properties distinct from those of individual molecules, is fundamental to understanding molecular interactions in various fields, including chemistry, physics, and the life sciences. However, precisely controlling aggregate structures and their properties without altering intrinsic molecular properties remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a versatile platform built on a unique mesoionic luminogens TPO (thiazolo[3,2-a]pyridin-4-ium-3-olate), to systematically investigate and modulate structure-property relationships in aggregates. By introducing alkyl chains of varying lengths, three TPO derivatives (TPO-X, X = 2, 8, or 12) enable fine-tuning of aggregate morphologies and photophysical behaviors. Mechanistic studies reveal that intermolecular interactions between the TPO core govern excited-state energy pathways, leading to distinct emission properties and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation abilities. Moreover, TPO-X showed distinct organelle targeting abilities: TPO-2 for mitochondria, TPO-8 for endoplasmic reticulum, and TPO-12 for cell membrane, respectively, and further achieved excellent tumor cell killing effect via different cell death pathways. This platform demonstrates strong adaptability for the study of aggregate science, enabling the design and regulation of novel aggregate materials in various research fields.Aggregate science, which studies how molecular aggregates exhibit properties distinct from those of individual molecules, is fundamental to understanding molecular interactions in various fields, including chemistry, physics, and the life sciences.

    "title": "Diverse bacterial pattern recognition receptors sense the conserved phage proteome",
    "summary": "Recognition of foreign molecules inside cells is critical for immunity in all domains of life. Proteins of the STAND NTPase superfamily, including eukaryotic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), play a central role in this process. In bacteria and archaea, although several STAND NTPase families have been reported to sense phage proteins, their functional diversity remains largely unexplored. Here, we conducted a systematic phylogenetic analysis of prokaryotic STAND NTPases and identified at least 90 structurally distinct families associated with antiviral defense. We first show that the uncharacterized Avs7 family recognizes the major capsid protein (MCP) of tailed phages. Three cryo-EM structures of Salmonella enterica Avs7 reveal an asymmetric, butterfly-shaped tetramer that assembles stepwise via large, MCP-induced conformational changes, incorporating bacterial translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) as a scaffold that is required for full defense activity. Using highly parallel genetic screens, we further show that 13 additional STAND families sense 12 conserved phage protein folds, encompassing most of the core structural and replicative components of tailed phages. These include two structurally distinct families--Avs8 (PD-{lambda}-4) and Avs10 (Erebus/Hypnos/bNACHT64)--that also recognize MCP, as well as 11 other families (Avs11-21) that recognize the portal, portal adaptor, tail nozzle, head-tail connector, tail terminator, tail tube protein, tail assembly chaperone, tape measure protein, DNA polymerase, helicase/RecA-type ATPase, and single-stranded DNA annealing protein (SSAP), respectively. Together, our findings highlight structure-based pattern recognition and host factor repurposing as fundamental strategies of bacterial immunity.",

    "summary": "The stringent response has far-reaching consequences, with links to antimicrobial resistance, stress and virulence. This study assessed the role of relA in nutritional, environmental and antimicrobial stress in Klebsiella pneumoniae, the extent of polysaccharide capsule and biofilm formation, and the pathogenic effect on Drosophila melanogaster. Two single mutants (KP03DrelA and KPPR1DrelA) obtained using the Lambda Red Recombinase Technique were the focus of analyses. We assessed environmental (ethanol, osmotic, heat) and nutritional stress (carbon, phosphate, amino acid) tolerance, capsule formation, and cell size determination in wild-type (WT) and mutant bacteria. Biofilm and agar plate susceptibility assays were performed on both starved and non-starved strains using gentamicin and ceftazidime, and stress response genes were analyzed. Drosophila melanogaster was used to examine the pathogenic effect of the presence or deletion of relA on fly survival. DrelA mutants had reduced fitness to environmental and nutritional stress compared to WT strains. Mutant strains' cell lengths were elongated and lacked a capsule versus WT and non-starved strains, and mutant strains exhibited enhanced biofilm formation or survival in the presence of ceftazidime and gentamicin. Stress response genes rpoD, phoR, phoU and pstB were absent during starvation, but rpoS was detected in C-, C+PO+ and serine hydroxamate (SHX) media; mrkA gene was not detected during starvation. Lastly, the animal model proved to be effective in showing infection levels associated with the presence of the relA gene.",

    "title": "Continued Challenges in High-Throughput Materials Predictions: MatterGen predicts compounds from the training dataset.",
    "summary": "High-throughput computational tools and generative AI models aim to revolutionise materials discovery by enabling the rapid prediction of novel inorganic compounds. However, these tools face persistent challenges with modelling compounds where multiple elements occupy the same crystallographic site, often leading to misclassification of known disordered phases as new ordered compounds. Recently, Microsoft revealed MatterGen as a tool for predicting new materials. As a proof of concept, MatterGen was used to predict the novel compound TaCr2O6, which was subsequently synthesised in a disordered form as Ta1/3Cr2/3O2. However, detailed crystallographic analysis, presented in this paper, reveals that this is not a novel compound but is identical to the already known compound Ta1/2Cr1/2O2 reported in 1972 and actually included in MatterGen\u2019s training dataset. These findings underscore the necessity of rigorous human verification in AI-assisted materials research, limiting their use for rapid and large-scale prediction of new materials. While generative models hold great promise, their effectiveness is currently limited by unresolved issues with disorder prediction and dataset validation. Improved integration with crystallographic expertise is essential to realise their full potential.",

    "summary": "Atomic-scale manipulation of chemical bond cleavage and formation offers significant advantages of extending the reaction controllability to the single-molecule regime and enabling the elucidation of fundamental reaction mechanisms. Herein, we drive reactions between two chemical species, open-shell monomeric radicals and closed-shell dimers in single-molecule junctions. Both monomers and dimers form a C-Au covalently-linked highly conducting junction in situ, with the conductance about 100 \u0301 higher than that of the dimer junction. First- principles calculations suggest that the substitution groups on the carbon in the C(sp3)-Au linkage bond effectively tunes the molecular junction conductance. Notably, captodative radicals enable the formation of weakly bonded spin-spin interactions in solution, yielding diamagnetic dimers, and we can reversibly switch between the dimer and the weakly- bonded radical pair by mechanically controlling the gap between the two electrodes.",

We demonstrate that imine groups work as chemical anchors for reliable formation of single-molecule junctions with gold electrodes. Scanning tunneling microscope-based break junction measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal that imine-terminated wires exhibit slightly higher conductance than amine-terminated analogs. Critically, in the presence of a nearby phenyl ring substituent, junction formation is suppressed with amine anchors but not with imines, indicating expanded molecular designs attained with imine linkers. We further find that in addition to the structures terminated with one imine and one thiomethyl linkers, dual-imine terminated molecules can also form stable molecular junctions. Our findings highlight that imines can be used as linkers with slightly reduced contact resistance than commonly used amines, offering new molecular designs for constructing molecular devices.",

    "title": "Accurate and Robust Prediction of Vertical Excitation Energies  with XYG3-Type Doubly Hybrid Density Functionals",
    "summary": "The XYG3-type doubly hybrid density functionals (xDHs) have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting ground-state energies and properties. However, until now, no method has been available to compute excited states with xDHs. In this work, we propose a method that combines the second order constricted variational density functional theory [CV(2)-DFT] within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA) and the configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles correction [CIS(D)] method to predict vertical excitation energies using xDHs. This new black-box method, dubbed TDA-xDH, has been benchmarked against a collective dataset of 410 excitation energies. The results demonstrate the high accuracy and robustness of xDHs. For local valence and Rydberg excitations represented by 352 benchmark data points, XYGJ-OS achieves a mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 0.08 eV, outperforming the more expensive coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) method (MAD = 0.11 eV). For 30 intramolecular charge-transfer (CT) excitations, XYGJ-OS also emerges as the best performer among tested functionals, with an MAD of 0.14 eV. Furthermore, XYGJ-OS exhibits excellent performance in predicting the 1La-1Lb gap for six linear polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), achieving an MAD of merely 0.01 eV. A case study on HAP-3MF further reveals that xDHs are able to correctly predict the inverted singlet-triplet gap. These results highlight the great promise of xDHs for accurately predicting a wide range of molecular excitation energies.",

    "summary": "Given that Mexico is one of the world's leading consumers of bottled water per capita, this study provides the first evidence of microplastic contamination across ten widely consumed commercial brands in the country. A total of 2,358 MP particles were detected with an average concentration of 39.3 \u00b1 14.6 particles/L. Statistical analysis (ANOVA, p = 0.0008) confirmed significant differences in MP levels between brands, likely attributed to variations in the production process and packaging quality. Fibers were the predominant shape of the detected MPs (72.2 %), and transparent particles were the most frequent color (57.7 %). Crucially, most detected MPs were smaller than 500 \u00b5m (80.3 %), raising toxicological concerns due to the high probability of systemic translocation in human tissues. Furthermore, FTIR spectroscopy confirmed that PET (66 %) and PP (18 %) were the dominant polymers, indicating that fragmentation and abrasion of the bottle and caps are the primary sources of MPs. The estimated intake assessment revealed that children are the most vulnerable population segment (228.2 particles/kg/year), exhibiting the highest relative MP dose normalized by body weight. Given the global evidence of adverse health effects from these polymers and their leached chemical additives, these findings underscore the urgent need to implement effective strategies to minimize MP exposure in bottled water.",

By monitoring pH, we gain simultaneous real-time insights into direct and mediated water splitting, direct and mediated dioxygen reduction, oxidation-statedependent pyridinium pKa effects, and trans-membrane OH\u2013 transport. These insights inform the development of a global regulation strategy, based on a single radical dependent dimensionless parameter, towards complete suppression of parasitic processes under practical battery cycling conditions. We also clarify the nature of the reaction between dioxygen and reduced viologen towards improved system engineering for long duration energy storage applications.",

    "summary": "Antibiotic resistance poses a critical global health threat, necessitating new strategies to address multidrug-resistant bacteria. This study presents the in silico design and evaluation of five novel benzimidazole derivatives (B1\u2013B5) as dual-action inhibitors targeting both the AcrB efflux pump and NDM-1 carbapenemase two major contributors to antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative pathogens. Computational tools, including Chemdraw, Spartan14, Chimera, Autodock Vina, and Biovia Discovery Studio, were employed for molecular modeling, docking, and visualization of key molecular interactions. All compounds satisfied Lipinski\u2019s rule of five, exhibited high predicted gastrointestinal absorption, and demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic profiles. Toxicity assessments indicated low to moderate risk, with B4 identified as the safest candidate (LD50: 3420 mg/kg). Molecular docking revealed that B1 and B5 displayed superior binding affinities to NDM-1 (-6.9 and -7.0 kcal/mol, respectively), outperforming the native ligand, while B3 and B4 matched or exceeded the native ligand\u2019s binding to AcrB (-11.1 and -11.0 kcal/mol). Detailed interaction analysis highlighted the importance of hydrogen bonds, pi-alkyl, and pi-pi stacking in stabilizing these complexes. These findings suggest that the designed benzimidazole derivatives hold promise as dual-target inhibitors, offering a potential pathway for developing new therapeutics to combat antibiotic resistance. Further experimental validation is recommended to confirm these computational results and advance these candidates toward clinical application.",

Additionally, short distances between the bridging biphenylene and metal atoms suggest arylene metal interactions.  Bimetallic Cu, Ag, and Au complexes of the ligand incorporating a carbazole donor and pyridyl acceptor (N2R22-) show absorption and emission energies that trend with the ionization potential of each metal, indicating metal character in the excited state. These properties contrast with our previously reported mononuclear Zn complex of N2R22-The structural and photophysical properties of five bimetallic d10 coinage metal complexes were presented.  The M M distances observed in the crystal structures of the bimetallic complexes are shorter than the sum of the metals\u2019 Van der Waals radii, suggesting attractive interactions between the d10 metal centers.  Additionally, short distances between the bridging biphenylene and metal atoms suggest arylene metal interactions.  The absorption and emission spectra of the bimetallic complexes redshift based on the oxidation potential of the metal ion.  This suggests involvement of metal based orbitals in the excited state transitions of the bimetallic complexes, which was corroborated by molecular modeling.  High photoluminescent quantum yields were observed in solution and in rigid media (up to PL = 0.75), and the excited state lifetimes in solution were found to exceed several microseconds.",

    "summary": "Nanocrystal (NC)\u2013derived solid electrolytes provide access to compositionally complex and metastable ion conductors, yet their measured transport properties are often dominated by extrinsic contact effects. We probe the coupled roles of temperature, uniaxial pressure, pellet microstructure, and electrode material on the electrochemical impedance response of Ag\u2084Zr\u2083S\u2088 NC pellets. Ag\u2084Zr\u2083S\u2088 NCs were synthesized via colloidal routes using distinct sulfur sources and consolidated into pellets with controlled surface chemistry. EIS was performed over 298\u2013393 K and 0.43\u20138.67 MPa using blocking and non-blocking electrodes. Pressure-dependent Nyquist analysis shows impedance is overwhelmingly dominated by interfacial and constriction resistances, with pressure primarily reducing contact limitations rather than altering intrinsic ion transport. Temperature\u2013pressure heat maps of the high-frequency resistance reveal thermally activated transport strongly modulated by mechanical contact and electrode compatibility. These results establish pressure-resolved impedance spectroscopy as a diagnostic framework for separating intrinsic and extrinsic transport contributions in NC-based solid electrolytes.",

    "summary": "Due to their low manufacturing cost and versatility in delivering diverse nucleic acid payloads such as plasmids (pDNA) and genome editor proteins, polymers have emerged as promising vectors in gene therapy. To encapsulate and deliver anionic nucleic acids, researchers add cationic polymers to payloads (e.g., pDNA), forming\nhighly fragile, complex, and heterogeneous polyplex assemblies. Large stoichiometric excesses of protonotable amine groups (in the polymers) over the phosphate groups\n(in the pDNA) are typical of polyplexes, which are frequently formed at nitrogen-to\u0002 phosphorous ratios between 5\u2013100 . Rather than binding irreversibly to pDNA pay\u0002loads, polymers predominantly exist as \u201cfree polymers\u201d which dynamically exchange with pDNA-bound polymers. Analogous to empty lipid nanoparticles and empty viral capsids, free polymers pose complex characterization, quality control, and regulatory challenges that may hinder clinical translation. We urgently need to quantify how free polymers modify critical polyplex properties (e.g., pDNA loading per polyplex) as well as biological outcomes (e.g., immunogenicity, pDNA delivery efficiency, and toxicity). We developed a unique analytical approach that unveils hitherto unsuspected roles\nplayed by free polymers during the complexation and intracellular delivery of pDNA. Applying asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4), we gently separated free\npolymers from crude polyplexes while conserving polyplex integrity. Unlike batch light scattering analysis of   fractionated crude polyplexes, which severely  underestimate polyplex size and pDNA loading per polyplex, AF4 sharpened measurements of poly\u0002plex molecular weight, pDNA loading, and radius of gyration by removing free poly\u0002mers and their background scattering contributions. Comparing solution properties\nvia light scattering, we discovered that AF4-purified polyplexes appeared over twice as large, loading twice as much pDNA as crude polyplexes. AF4 uncovered contrasts\nin the biological performance of crude and purified polyplexes. Free polymers aggra\u0002vated inflammatory responses in macrophages by up to 22%. Removing free polymers depressed transfection efficiency by 50% while improving cell viability by 30%; reintro\u0002ducing free polymers abrogated these contrasts. By separating and quantifying free polymers in polyplexes, AF4 illuminated a far more complex portrait of polyplex so\u0002lution properties that has hitherto remained elusive to conventional characterization\nmethods. Our work has revealed pathways to ameliorate polymer-associated toxicity and inflammation during pDNA delivery.",

This paper presents a novel alternative approach designed to achieve the same outcomes as manual inspection but with enhanced clarity.

The primary beneficiaries of this study are instructors at the introductory level of chemistry, where manual inspection is inevitable. This article serves to contribute to the ongoing discussions surrounding issues with manual inspection, suitable introductory alternatives, and the overall comprehension of the somewhat unteachable and abstract process of balancing chemical equations.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces Post-Inspection Analysis (PIA), a concept for understanding and reverse engineering balanced equations of similar reactions. Here we explore the idea that balanced equations contain useable information observed by grouping and analysing similar equations, allowing us to uncover observations that support the teaching of the balancing process and aid the formalisation of algorithms or methods applicable to families of equations. Through this framework, logical relationships and proportional consistencies that define entire families of reactions are revealed. Applied to acidic redox and acid\u2013base neutralisation (ABN) systems, the concept generalises established methods (such as the oxidation-number (ON) method for certain redox systems and the ionic half-reaction/equation method for ABN reactions) and provides a foundation for deriving new methods and procedures (such as the Poly-Var Algorithm for the core ABN reaction). PIA therefore offers a conceptual lens for analysing balanced equations distinct from existing generalised approaches. This study contributes to the understanding and overall teaching of the balancing process.",

    "title": "Multiscale modelling of the electrocatalysis of enzymes: Insights into the performance of microperoxidase at an aqueous/graphene interface and their exploitation to improve performance",
    "summary": "There is great interest in systems where enzymes are adsorbed on and act at electrode surfaces \u2013 enzymatic biofuel cells, bioreactors and biosensors are just three examples. Whilst such systems have been the subject of extensive study and development since the 1960s, the rate of progress in this research is hindered by a lack of molecular-level understanding of the enzyme adsorption process and adsorbed states, and the associated electron transfer processes. Herein, we present and then demonstrate a multiscale approach that combines molecular dynamics simulation to elucidate the former and density functional theory (MD/DFT) for the latter. The demonstration of the new approach focused on a system involving the microperoxidase-11 (MP-11) enzyme, a microenzyme made up of a Fe-containing heme ring attached to an 11-residue scaffold, a graphene electrode, and a neutral-pH saline solution. For this system, the adsorbed MP-11 was found to adopt six possible heme configurations, where the configurations are defined by the distance of the iron from the graphene and the angle between the normals of the heme ring and graphene electrode. The rate constant for electron transfer between the MP-11 and graphene evaluated through combining the MD and DFT results and their variation with overpotential are comparable to the limited experimental data.  The results were used to illustrate how the new multiscale approach could be used to improve electrocatalytic performance of the system.",

    "title": "Photocatalytic Conversion of Carbon Dioxide Over Silver-Modified Lanthanide Titanate Under Photoirradiation Exceeding 300 nm",
    "summary": "The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 into valuable chemicals is a promising approach for artificial photosynthesis. The photocatalytic conversion of CO2 over Ag-modified lanthanide titanates (Ln2Ti2O7) was investigated in this study under photoirradiation with wavelengths longer than 300 nm using 2-propanol as a hole scavenger. Among the various Ln2Ti2O7 materials tested, La2Ti2O7 exhibited superior photocatalytic performance. The activity was strongly dependent on the crystallinity and surface area of the La2Ti2O7 host, with the optimal sample obtained by calcination at 1423 K for 2 h. Furthermore, the Ag cocatalyst loading method significantly affected the CO production rate. Chemical reduction facilitated the formation of highly dispersed, small metallic Ag nanoparticles (2\u201310 nm), which were essential for efficient CO2 reduction. In contrast, the photodeposition and impregnation methods resulted in the formation of larger, aggregated Ag particles (20\u201350 nm), leading to lower photocatalytic activity. The optimised Ag/La2Ti2O7 photocatalyst achieved a CO formation rate of approximately 120 \u00b5mol h\u22121 with high selectivity (>90%). The stoichiometric formation of acetone and isotopic labelling experiments using 13CO2 confirmed that the reaction proceeded via the reduction of CO2 to CO, coupled with the oxidation of 2-propanol.",

While CTB primarily recognizes GM1 glycosphingolipid or galactose ligands, GM1 is undetectable in the human SI, and fucose ligands are a key alternative binding target. Previously, we developed linear norbornenyl glycopolymers as biomimetic inhibitors that block CTB binding through interchain crosslinking, forming CTB-glycopolymer aggregates. To assess the polymers\u2019 potential efficacy under flow conditions, we evaluated CTB-glycopolymer binding kinetics under dynamic conditions using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Copolymer with a random display of galactose and fucose (pGal50Fuc50) showed nanomolar avidity with stable complex formation driven primarily by a slow dissociation rate in the multivalent phase (kd1). In contrast, an equimolar mixture of homopolymers (pGal100 + pFuc100) exhibited similar binding avidity and comparable inhibitory efficacy but did not display slow-dissociation. Moreover, random copolymer pGal25Fuc75 dissociated slowly even from low-CTB-density surfaces. These results highlight the superior stability of copolymers in forming CTB\u2013copolymer aggregates under low CTB abundance and flow conditions. These findings underscore the importance of co-displaying galactose and fucose for complex formation and for developing clinically-useful therapies.",

    "title": "Aqueous Dispersion of Carbon Nanotubes by Chlorine Dioxide Oxidation",
    "summary": "The poor solubility and dispersibility of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in aqueous media remain critical limitations for their practical application because conventional oxidative treatments typically require harsh conditions that degrade the nanotube structure. Here, we report a simple and scalable method for dispersing SWCNTs in water via chlorine dioxide (ClO\u2082\u2022)-mediated oxidation under ambient conditions. The treatment selectively introduced oxygenated functionalities\u2014including hydroxy, carbonyl, and carboxy groups\u2014onto the CNT surface while preserving the tubular framework, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The resulting dispersions exhibited long-term colloidal stability without the need for surfactants, supported by a strongly negative \u03b6 potential (\u221241.6 mV). Importantly, electronic conductivity was largely maintained: the resistivity of oxidized CNT films was only threefold higher than that of sodium cholate\u2013dispersed CNTs (0.045 vs 0.016 \u03a9\u00b7cm at 25 \u00b0C), with <10% variation between 25 and 50 \u00b0C. This unique balance between enhanced aqueous dispersibility and preserved charge transport underscores ClO\u2082\u2022 oxidation as a green and effective strategy for producing water-processable CNTs, showing promise for applications in pharmaceutical drugs, printable electronics, functional composites, energy storage, and sensing.",

    "summary": "Computational toxicology plays a pivotal role in modern drug discovery and environmental risk assessment; however, the reliability of predictive models on unseen chemical scaffolds remains a critical bottleneck. Deep learning architectures, despite their prevalence, are susceptible to \u2019silent failures\u2019\u2014yielding high-confidence errors on out-of-distribution data\u2014which poses significant risks in safety-critical applications. In this study, we propose a \u2019Safe-byDesign\u2019 hybrid framework to mitigate this epistemic uncertainty. Rather than relying on a single algorithmic paradigm, we integrate the explicit structural \u2019memory\u2019 of classical Random Forests with the topological \u2019intuition\u2019 of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) via a transparent Stacking Ensemble (Logistic Regression) functioning as a Mixture of Experts (MoE). Evaluated across 12 Tox21 endpoints using a rigorous 5-seed benchmarking protocol under Nested Scaffold Split, our analysis demonstrates that classical models serve as an essential robustness layer in data-scarce regimes. Crucially, the Hybrid MoE functions as a fail-safe mechanism, preventing performance degradation in tasks where pure GNNs struggle to generalize (e.g., NR-AR-LBD), while leveraging complementary strengths in others (e.g., SR-MMP). Benchmarking against the industry-standard DeepChem GraphConv model reveals statistical equivalence (p > 0.05) in overall performance, with the Hybrid framework exhibiting superior predictive stability in 7 out of 12 assays, particularly in complex endpoints such as SR-p53 and Androgen Receptor targets. These findings suggest that the proposed architecture offers a viable pathway toward achieving state-of-the-art predictive power without compromising the interpretability required for regulatory acceptance.",

    "summary": "Manganese is perhaps the most electronically versatile element, accessing eleven different formal oxidation states (-3 to +7). However, the redox properties and reactivities of low valent monometallic Mn(0) and Mn(-I) systems remain severely underexplored due to the propensity of Mn0 to dimerize and quench high-energy metalloradicals. We report a new series of redox active monometallic Mn(I), Mn(0) and Mn(-I) complexes containing a BH2-bridged dicarbene ligand coordinated to Mn, all which have been characterized using a suite of experimental and cutting-edge computational (DFT) methods. Slow electron transfer kinetics at Mn(I/0) are observed, with computations and electrochemical simulations in excellent agreement with experiment. Despite the lack of steric bulk at the BH2-bridged Mn(0), the tBu groups at the dicarbene provide sufficient steric protection to prevent dimerization, with percent buried volume (%V_bur) serving as a steric ranking tool for to predict whether Mn(0) complexes will remain monometallic in solution. We show that when %V_bur > 83% prevents dimerization for a diverse array of of Mn(0) complexes from the literature. Ligand sterics of the BPh2-bridged and BH2 bridged complexes dictate reaction outcomes when Mn(I) and Mn(-I) are exposed to nucleophiles and electrophiles, respectively, while the Mn(0) metalloradicals facilitate radical cycloisomerization catalysis of 6-iodo-1-hexene at room temperature. This work underscores the importance of ligand sterics in rationalizing reactivity patterns at Mn and offers valuable insights for designing chelating ligands that can selectively leverage  Mn(I/0/-I) states in redox-mediated reactions.",

    "summary": "Breaking the long-standing permeability\u2013selectivity trade-off remains a central challenge in membrane-based carbon dioxide separations. Here we report a heteroatom-engineering strategy that leverages structurally precise covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to transcend this limitation in mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). Two isostructural, \u03c0-conjugated two-dimensional COFs, TUS-621 and TUS-622, were rationally designed through symmetry-guided reticulation of a hexatopic triphenylene node with oxygen- and sulfur-containing diamine linkers, respectively, enabling systematic modulation of pore surface chemistry without altering topology. When incorporated into a Pebax polymer matrix, these COFs function as CO2-philic, molecularly defined transport domains that synergistically couple preferential CO2 sorption with ordered and fast diffusion channels. The optimized TUS-621/Pebax-10% membrane exhibits a CO2 permeability of 433 Barrer with a CO2/CH4 selectivity of 55.3 under mixed-gas conditions, decisively surpassing the 2008 Robeson upper bound for CO2/CH4 separation, while simultaneously achieving high CO2/H2 separation performance (CO2 permeability of 407 Barrer and selectivity of 25.2). Comprehensive pressure- and temperature-dependent permeation studies reveal that selectivity remains remarkably stable over 2\u201310 bar and 25\u2013100 \u00b0C, underscoring the robustness of the COF-enabled transport pathways. Long-term operation over 30 days shows negligible performance decay, highlighting excellent resistance to physical aging and interfacial degradation. Comparative analysis establishes that oxygen-rich pore environments in TUS-621 impart stronger CO2 affinity and higher accessible surface area than the sulfur-containing analogue, directly translating molecular-level design into macroscopic separation performance. This work demonstrates that heteroatom-engineered COFs provide a powerful platform for overcoming fundamental transport trade-offs and advancing MMMs toward practical, high-efficiency CO2 separations.",

    "summary": "Cellulose-based fluorescent materials enjoy advantages such as excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability, and environmental friendliness, making them potentially useful for chemical sensing, bioimaging, and information encryption. However, traditional cellulose-based fluorescent materials face issues of single functionality and aggregation-caused quenching, making the development of multifunctional fluorescent cellulose materials applicable in aggregated states desirable but challenging. Herein, we innovatively endowed fluorescent cellulose materials with an aggregation-induced emission characteristic through hydroxyl-yne click reaction. The developed ECTPEs exhibit breakthrough performance with high transparency (>95%), full ultraviolet (UV)-shielding efficiency (>99.9%), accompanied by fluorescence characteristics, thereby achieving simultaneous UV blocking and indicating functions for UV-sensitive materials. Additionally, ECTPEs demonstrate grafting ratio-dependent multicolor fluorescence, enabling their application in high-resolution fluorescent QR codes. The further development of acid-responsive ECTPE-MTPAPs through secondary grafting realizes fluorescence color switching under acidic stimulation and enables the creation of dynamic multicolor coding devices with enhanced data storage density and sophisticated encryption capabilities. Significantly, an amine exchange strategy based on dynamic enol ether bonds effectively resolves the inherent conflict between material functionalization and degradability. This work provides an innovative methodology for developing reversible multifunctional fluorescent cellulose materials, offering crucial guidance for advancing the development of sustainable fluorescent materials.",

Existing diagnostics typically analyze ARs in isolation, despite the frequent coexistence and interaction of multiple filaments. We introduce a topological framework for AR analysis based on framed braids and framed braidoids, which encodes both the geometric interaction of AR centroids and the internal evolution of moisture transport.\n  In this approach, AR filaments are represented as strands whose time-ordered crossings form braid words, while moisture-based framing captures internal intensification or weakening along each filament. Applying this framework to reanalysis-derived Atmospheric River track data, we construct braid and framed braid representations over sliding time windows and analyze a strongly interacting multi-filament AR episode in the North Pacific. The results show that braid-based indicators capture structural reorganizations and moisture intensification episodes that are not apparent from centroid geometry or IVT magnitude alone, offering a complementary structural perspective on atmospheric moisture transport.",

In the thermodynamic limit ($N\\to\\infty$), a mean-field treatment yields classical equations of motion, whose dynamics are characterized via the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE). Focusing on the thermodynamic limit, we map out chaotic, quasiperiodic, and periodic phases via bifurcation diagrams, MLEs, and Fourier spectra of evolved observables, identifying classic period-doubling bifurcations and fractal boundaries in the regions of attractors. Finite-size quantum simulations in the Dicke basis reveal that while both quantum and classical systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases, finite-size effects suppress some behaviors present in the thermodynamic limit. The sign of $\\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}}$ serves as a key indicator of convergence between quantum and classical dynamics, which agree over timescales up to the Lyapunov time. Analysis of the density matrix shows that convergence occurs only when its nonzero elements are sharply localized. However, the nonconvergence does not imply a fundamental difference between quantum and classical dynamics: in chaotic regimes, although the evolution orbits of quantum and classical systems show significant differences, quantum evolution becomes mixed and diffusively explores the Hilbert space, signaling quantum chaos, which can be confirmed by the delocalized nature of the density matrix.",

By systematically varying particle geometry -- from spheres to strongly non-convex polypods -- as well as frictional properties and the number of branches, we explore how these parameters, together with the preparation protocol, shape the internal structure of the system. Using X-ray tomography combined with a dedicated image-analysis pipeline, we accurately extract the position, orientation, and contacts of every particle in each pile. This allows us to quantify the evolution of key structural observables as a function of particle geometry and preparation method. In particular, we measure the distributions of local packing fraction, coordination number, number of neighbors, and contact locations, along with particle-particle positional and orientational correlations. More importantly, we construct a new stability indicator that correlates perfectly with the observed pile stabilities, enabling us to identify the fundamental mechanisms responsible for \\textit{geometrically induced cohesion} in granular systems composed of non-interlocking particle shapes: interdigitation, rotational constraint, friction-mediated cohesion, and the ability of a pile to re-stabilize.",

    "title": "Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy without a matrix",
    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00102v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) is a highly effective optimization technique. A primary challenge when applying CMA-ES in high dimensionality is sampling from a multivariate normal distribution with an arbitrary covariance matrix, which involves its decomposition. The cubic complexity of this process is the main obstacle to applying CMA-ES in highdimensional spaces. We introduce a version of CMA-ES that uses no covariance matrix at all. In the proposed matrix-free CMA-ES, an archive stores the vectors of differences between individuals and the midpoint, normalized by the step size. New individuals are generated as the weighted combinations of the vectors from the archive. We prove that the probability distribution of individuals generated by the proposed method is identical to that of the standard CMA-ES. Experimental results show that reducing the archive size to store only a fixed number of the most recent populations is sufficient, without compromising optimization efficiency. The matrix-free and matrix-based CMA-ES achieve comparable results on the quadratic function when the step-size adaptation is turned off. When coupled with the step-size adaptation method, the matrix-free CMA-ES converges faster than the matrix-based, and usually yields the results of a comparable or superior quality, according to the results obtained for the CEC'2017 benchmark suite. Presented approach simplifies the algorithm, offers a novel perspective on covariance matrix adaptation, and serves as a stepping stone toward even more efficient methods.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00059v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We explore the evolution of sub-Neptune (radii between $\\sim$1.5 and 4 R$_\\oplus$) exoplanet interior structures using our upgraded planetary evolution code, \\texttt{APPLE}, which self-consistently couples the thermal and compositional evolution of the whole structure. We incorporate stably stratified regions with convective mixing and, for the first time, ab initio results on the phase separation of silicate-hydrogen mixtures to model silicate rain in sub-Neptune envelopes. We demonstrate that inefficient mantle cooling can retain sufficient heat to Gyr ages: inefficient heat transport from mantle to envelope alone keeps radii $\\sim$10\\% larger than predicted by adiabatic models at late times. Silicate rain can contribute an additional $\\sim$5\\% to the radius, depending on envelope mass and initial metal abundance. The silicate-hydrogen immiscibility region may lie in the middle or even upper envelope, far above the envelope-mantle boundary layer, and bifurcates the envelope into two an upper, hydrogen-rich region and a lower, metal-rich region above the mantle. If silicate rain occurs, atmospheres should appear depleted of silicates while radii remain inflated at late ages. To demonstrate this, we present interior evolution models for GJ 1214 b, K2-18 b, TOI-270 d, and TOI-1801 b, showing that hot, liquid silicate mantles with thin envelopes reproduce their radii and mean densities, providing an alternative to water-world interpretations. These results imply that bulk compositions inferred from mean density must account for mantle thermal state and envelope mixing/phase separation history; such thermal ``memories'' may constrain formation entropies and temperatures when metallicities are better measured.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.11930v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Mechanical lattices support topological wave phenomena governed by geometric phases. We develop a compact Hilbert space description for one-dimensional elastic chains, expressing intra-cell motion as a normalized superposition of orthogonal eigenstates and tracking complex amplitudes as trajectories on a Bloch sphere. For diatomic lattices, this framework makes inversion symmetry protection explicit: the relative phase between in-phase and out-of-phase modes is piecewise locked, and the Zak phase is quantized with band-dependent jumps at symmetry points. Extending the analysis to triatomic lattices shows that restoring inversion retains quantization, whereas breaking it dequantizes the geometric phase while leaving the spectral origin invariant. Viewing norm-preserving transformations of the modal coefficient pair as Bloch sphere rotations, we demonstrate classical analogues of single-qubit logic gates. A pi-phase rotation about a transverse axis swaps the modal poles, and a longitudinal-axis phase flip maps balanced superpositions to their conjugates. These gate-like operations are realized by controlled evolution across wavenumber space and can be driven or reprogrammed through spatiotemporal stiffness modulation. Introducing space-time modulation hybridizes carrier and sideband harmonics, producing continuous phase winding and open-path geometric phases accumulated along the Floquet trajectory. Across static and modulated regimes, the framework unifies algebraic and geometric viewpoints, remains robust to gauge and basis choices, and operates directly on amplitude-phase data. The results clarify how symmetry, modulation, and topology jointly govern dispersion, modal mixing, and phase accumulation, providing tools to analyze and design vibration and acoustic functionalities in engineered structures.",

Culture evolves as these entities interact, generating path dependence, attractor states and tension, with long-term stability punctuated by rapid systemic transformations. Cultural learning and creativity is modelled as coherence-seeking information processing: individuals filter, transform and recombine input in light of prior acquisitions and dissonance reduction, thereby creating increasingly structured worldviews. Higher-order traits such as goals, skills, norms and cognitive gadgets act as emergent metafilters that regulate subsequent selection by defining what counts as coherent. Together, these filtering processes self-organise into epistemic niches, echo chambers, polarised groups and institutions that channel information flows and constrain future evolution. In this view, LLMs and recommender algorithms are products of cultural embeddings that now act back on cultural systems by automated filtering and recombination of information, reshaping future dynamics of cultural systems.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00640v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: WASP-107~b is an extremely low-density super-puff exoplanet whose inflated radius and evidence of strong internal heating make it a key target for understanding planetary structure and evolution. Its orbital eccentricity is a critical parameter for testing mechanisms such as tidal heating and high-eccentricity migration, yet previous measurements have remained inconclusive. Due to the large radial velocity jitter caused by stellar activity, and the presence of at least one additional planet in the system, previous radial velocity measurements could not robustly determine the eccentricity of WASP-107~b. Here we combine the new JWST secondary eclipse data with transit timing data from HST, TESS, and JWST to measure the eccentricity of WASP-107~b. Our joint analysis shows that WASP-107~b has an eccentricity of $0.09\\pm0.02$, a mass of $0.096\\pm0.005 \\, M_J$, and an orbital period of $5.721487\\pm0.000001$~days. We find the $99.7\\%$ lower limit of the eccentricity is about 0.04. These new measurements are consistent with the scenario in which WASP-107~b is in the final stage of high-eccentricity migration. Preliminary estimate shows that eccentricity-driven tidal dissipation can provide a significant contribution to the energy required to sustain the observed radius inflation of WASP-107~b. Our results establish the dynamical status of one of the most intriguing low-density exoplanets known, and offer new insights into its formation and evolution history.",

In response, the UE is transitioning from a passive transceiver into an active entity that directly contributes to system-level performance. In this context, this article examines the evolving role of the UE in mMIMO systems during the transition from fifth-generation (5G) to sixth-generation (6G), bridging third generation partnership project (3GPP) standardization, device implementation, and architectural innovation. Through a chronological review of 3GPP Releases 15 to 19, we highlight the progression of UE functionalities from basic channel state information (CSI) reporting to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based CSI enhancement and UE-initiated beam management. We further examine key implementation challenges, including multi-panel UE (MPUE) architectures, on-device intelligent processing, and energy-efficient operation, and then discuss corresponding architectural innovations under practical constraints. Using digital-twin-based evaluations, we validate the impact of emerging UE-centric functionalities, illustrating that UE-initiated beam reporting improves throughput in realistic mobility scenarios, while a multi-panel architecture enhances link robustness compared with a single-panel UE.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00735v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Nielsen's geometric approach to quantum circuit complexity provides a Riemannian framework for quantifying the cost of implementing unitary (closed--system) dynamics. For open dynamics, however, the reduced evolution is described by quantum channels and admits many inequivalent Stinespring realizations, so any meaningful complexity notion must specify which microscopic resources are counted as accessible and which transformations are regarded as gauge. We introduce and analyze a geometric complexity functional for families of quantum channels based on unitary dilations. We distinguish an implementation-dependent complexity, defined relative to explicit dilation data, from an intrinsic channel complexity obtained by minimizing over a physically motivated class of admissible dilations (e.g. bounded environment dimension, energy or norm constraints, and penalty structures). The functional has a subtractive form: it compares the geometric cost of the total unitary realization with a canonical surrogate term that removes purely environmental contributions. We justify this subtraction from concise postulates, including closed-system consistency, environment-only neutrality, and invariance under dilation gauge transformations that leave the channel unchanged. This leads to a companion quantity, noise complexity, quantifying the loss of geometric complexity relative to a prescribed ideal closed evolution. We establish a coherence-based lower bound for unitary geometric complexity, derive structural properties such as linear time scaling under time-homogeneous dilations, and obtain dissipator--controlled bounds in the Markovian (GKSL/Lindblad) regime under a standard dilation construction. Finally, we illustrate the framework on canonical benchmark noise models, including dephasing, amplitude damping, and depolarizing (Pauli) channels.",

Reservoir Computing (RC) mitigates these challenges by replacing backpropagation with fixed recurrent layers and a convex readout optimization, yet conventional RC architectures still scale poorly with input dimensionality. We introduce a Sequential Reservoir Computing (Sequential RC) architecture that decomposes a large reservoir into a series of smaller, interconnected reservoirs. This design reduces memory and computational costs while preserving long-term temporal dependencies. Using both low-dimensional chaotic systems (Lorenz63) and high-dimensional physical simulations (2D vorticity and shallow-water equations), Sequential RC achieves 15-25% longer valid forecast horizons, 20-30% lower error metrics (SSIM, RMSE), and up to three orders of magnitude lower training cost compared to LSTM and standard RNN baselines. The results demonstrate that Sequential RC maintains the simplicity and efficiency of conventional RC while achieving superior scalability for high-dimensional dynamical systems.

    "title": "Evolutionary Optimization of Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Advancing Generalizability by the Baldwin Effect",
    "summary": "arXiv:2312.03243v4 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are at the forefront of scientific machine learning, making possible the creation of machine intelligence that is cognizant of physical laws and able to accurately simulate them. However, today's PINNs are often trained for a single physics task and require computationally expensive re-training for each new task, even for tasks from similar physics domains. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a pioneering approach to advance the generalizability of PINNs through the framework of Baldwinian evolution. Drawing inspiration from the neurodevelopment of precocial species that have evolved to learn, predict and react quickly to their environment, we envision PINNs that are pre-wired with connection strengths inducing strong biases towards efficient learning of physics. A novel two-stage stochastic programming formulation coupling evolutionary selection pressure (based on proficiency over a distribution of physics tasks) with lifetime learning (to specialize on a sampled subset of those tasks) is proposed to instantiate the Baldwin effect. The evolved Baldwinian-PINNs demonstrate fast and physics-compliant prediction capabilities across a range of empirically challenging problem instances with more than an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy at a fraction of the computation cost compared to state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning methods. For example, when solving the diffusion-reaction equation, a 70x improvement in accuracy was obtained while taking 700x less computational time. This paper thus marks a leap forward in the meta-learning of PINNs as generalizable physics solvers. Sample codes are available at https://github.com/chiuph/Baldwinian-PINN.",

    "title": "The Solar Neighborhood LV: Spectral Characterization of an Equatorial Sample of 580 K Dwarfs",
    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00462v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We present a spectroscopic characterization of 580 K dwarfs within 33 pc, observed with the CHIRON echelle spectrograph (R=80,000) on the SMARTS 1.5m telescope. This volume-limited sample is part of the RKSTAR survey of $\\sim$4400 K dwarf primaries within 50 pc. Using Empirical SpecMatch and the diagnostic lines H-alpha (6562.8 Angstrom) and Li I (6707.8 Angstrom), we derive stellar properties, activity status, and age indicators calibrated against 35 benchmark K dwarfs with ages from 20 Myr to 5 Gyr. We find that 7.4% (43 stars) exhibit signatures of youth and/or chromospheric activity: 19 stars show lithium absorption indicating ages $<$1 Gyr, and 36 display H$\\alpha$ emission. Kinematic analysis using BANYAN $\\Sigma$ identifies 8 additional young stars through membership in the AB Doradus moving group and the Hyades cluster, bringing the total young/active population to 8.8% (51 stars). Stellar parameters span 3600--5500 K in \\teff, $-$0.60 to $+$0.55 dex in [Fe/H], and $<$10 to $>$25 km s$^{-1}$ in $v\\sin i$. A metal-poor population ([Fe/H] $\\leq -$0.50 dex) comprises 4\\% of the sample. Galactic kinematics place 80% in the thin disk and 18.4% in the thick disk, with one halo member (HD 134439). Young and active stars are predominantly thin disk members, with two thick disk exceptions. Cross-matching with NASA's Exoplanet Archive reveals only 7.5% (44 stars) host confirmed planets as of July 2025. Our results identify 529 mature, inactive K dwarfs as prime targets for terrestrial planet searches, providing a crucial resource for exoplanet habitability studies in the solar neighborhood.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2508.21755v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: This work presents an analysis of semantic communication in the context of First-Order Logic (FOL)-based deduction. Specifically, the receiver holds a set of hypotheses about the State of the World (SotW), while the transmitter has incomplete evidence about the true SotW but lacks access to the ground truth. The transmitter aims to communicate limited information to help the receiver identify the hypothesis most consistent with true SotW. We formulate the objective as approximating the posterior distribution of the transmitter at the receiver. Using Stirling's approximation, this reduces to a constrained, finite-horizon resource allocation problem. Applying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions yields a truncated water-filling solution. Despite the problem's non-convexity, symmetry and permutation invariance ensure global optimality. Based on this, we design message selection strategies, both for single- and multi- round communication, and model the receiver's inference as an $m$-ary Bayesian hypothesis testing problem. Under the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) rule, our communication strategy achieves optimal performance within budget constraints. We further analyze convergence rates and validate the theoretical findings through experiments, demonstrating reduced error over random selection and prior methods.",

We present a consistent derivation of reaction-diffusion equations from systems of suitably rescaled kinetic Boltzmann equations for distribution functions of cell populations interacting in a host medium. We show at first that the classical diffusive limit of kinetic equations leads to linear diffusion terms only. Then, we show possible strategies in order to obtain, from the kinetic level, macroscopic systems with nonlinear diffusion and also with cross-diffusion effects. The derivation from a kinetic description has the advantage of relating reaction and diffusion coefficients to the microscopic parameters of the interactions. We present an application of our approach to the study of the evolution of different bacterial populations on a leaf surface. Turing instability properties of the relevant macroscopic systems are investigated by analytical methods and numerical tools, with particular emphasis on pattern formation for varying parameters in two-dimensional space domains.",

    "title": "The Physics of Causation",
    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00515v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Assembly theory (AT) introduces a concept of causation as a material property, constitutive of a metrology of evolution and selection. The physical scale for causation is quantified with the assembly index, defined as the minimum number of steps necessary for a distinguishable object to exist, where steps are assembled recursively. Observing countable copies of high assembly index objects indicates that a mechanism to produce them is persistent, such that the object's environment builds a memory that traps causation within a contingent chain. Copy number and assembly index underlie the standardized metrology for detecting causation (assembly index), and evidence of contingency (copy number). Together, these allow the precise definition of a selective threshold in assembly space, understood as the set of all causal possibilities. This threshold demarcates life (and its derivative agential, intelligent and technological forms) as structures with persistent copies beyond the threshold. In introducing a fundamental concept of material causation to explain and measure life, AT represents a departure from prior theories of causation, such as interventional ones, which have so far proven incompatible with fundamental physics. We discuss how AT's concept of causation provides the foundation for a theory of physics where novelty, contingency and the potential for open-endedness are fundamental, and determinism is emergent along assembled lineages.",

This study presents an experimental and computational investigation of the plastic deformation behavior of a non-equatomic CrMnFeNi alloy, designed to maintain a stability of fcc phase in a large domain of temperatures and to balance stacking fault (SF) energies for enhanced strain hardening and ductility. Tensile tests reveal a temperature-dependent reduction in mechanical strength, attributed to thermally activated deformation mechanisms and microstructural evolution. Molecular dynamics simulations of single- and polycrystals capture dislocation activity, SF formation, and twin nucleation as a function of strain and temperature. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) confirms twin formation and grain boundary activity. The Schmid factor mapping is drawn to interpret local slip activity and anisotropic deformation behavior. The absence of Co leads to enhanced high-temperature strength compared to the Cantor alloy.",

Building on the recently introduced ESP framework, this work focuses on rigorous and thermodynamically consistent pressure/stress evaluation in the isothermal--isobaric ensemble. ESP employs prolate spheroidal wave functions as both splitting and spreading kernels, reducing the Fourier grid size needed to reach a prescribed pressure accuracy compared with current widely used mesh-Ewald methods based on Gaussian splitting and B-spline spreading. We derive a unified pressure-tensor formulation applicable to isotropic, semi-isotropic, anisotropic, and fully flexible cells, and show that the long-range pressure can be evaluated with a single forward FFT followed by diagonal scaling, whereas force evaluation requires both forward and inverse transforms. We provide production implementations in LAMMPS and GROMACS and validate pressure and force accuracy on bulk water, LiTFSI ionic liquids, and a transmembrane system. Benchmarks on up to $3\\times 10^3$ CPU cores demonstrate strong scaling and reduced communication cost at matched accuracy, particularly for NPT pressure evaluation.",

To address this gap, we develop an extended SIRS model that distinguishes infections with the original strain and a mutant strain, and explicitly introduces a vaccinated compartment state. At the behavioral level, we employ evolutionary game theory to model individual vaccination decisions, where strategies are determined by both neighbors' choices and the current epidemiological situation. This process corresponds to the time-varying vaccination rate of susceptible individuals transitioning to vaccinated individuals at the epidemic spreading level. We then couple the epidemic and vaccination behavioral processes through the microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA) and finally investigate the evolutionary dynamics via numerical simulations. The results show that our framework can effectively mitigate outbreaks across different disease scenarios. Sensitivity analysis further reveals that vaccination uptake is most strongly influenced by vaccine cost, efficacy, and perceived risk of side effects. Overall, this behavior-aware modeling framework captures the co-evolution of viral mutation and vaccination behavior, providing quantitative and theoretical support for designing effective public health vaccination policies.",

For more general cases of system-bath coupling, the quantum master equation (QME) approach is employed for the derivation of multistep time evolution equations for Green function-like operators.

Populations evolve over time according to a piecewise linear system of ordinary differential equations subject to a non-negativity constraint resulting in discrete time extinction and revival events. The dynamics are generated by a random elliptic community matrix with tunable correlation strength. We show that, independent of the correlation strength, solutions of the system are confined to subsets of the phase space that can be cast as time-varying Gardner volumes from the theory of learning in neural networks. These volumes decrease with the diversity (i.e. the fraction of extant species) and become exponentially small in the long-time limit. Using standard results from random matrix theory, the changing diversity is then linked to a sequence of contractions and expansions in the spectrum of the community matrix over time, resulting in a sequence of May-type stability problems determining whether the total population evolves toward complete extinction or unbounded growth. In the case of unbounded growth, we show the model allows for a particularly simple nonlinear extension in which the solutions instead evolve towards a new attractor.",

While recent work has proposed practical measures to detect emergence, these approaches tend to double-count the contribution of shared components, which substantially hinders their capability to effectively study large systems. In this work, we introduce a family of improved information-theoretic measures of emergence that iteratively correct for double-counted terms. Our approach is computationally efficient and provides a controllable trade-off between computational load and sensitivity, leading to more accurate and versatile estimates of emergence. The benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated by successfully detecting emergence in both simulated and real-world data related to flocking behaviour.",

It is characterized by a high mortality rate and a poor prognosis. In this work, we explore how a clinical oncologist can apply a Stackelberg game-theoretic framework to prolong metastatic prostate cancer survival, or even make it chronic in duration. We utilize a Bayesian optimization approach to identify the optimal adaptive chemotherapeutic treatment policy for a single drug (Abiraterone) to maximize the time before the patient begins to show symptoms. We show that, with precise adaptive optimization of drug delivery, it is possible to significantly prolong the cancer suppression period, potentially converting metastatic prostate cancer from a terminal disease to a chronic disease for most patients, as supported by clinical and analytical evidence. We suggest that clinicians might explore the possibility of implementing a high-level tight control (HLTC) treatment, in which the trigger signals (i.e. biomarker levels) for drug administration and cessation are both high and close together, typically yield the best outcomes, as demonstrated through both computation and theoretical analysis. This simple insight could serve as a valuable guide for improving current adaptive chemotherapy treatments in other hormone-sensitive cancers.",

We propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for continuous-time synchronization regulation, in which system trajectories and control inputs are jointly parameterized and constrained by the governing dynamics. Macroscopic synchronization objectives are imposed directly at the trajectory level by enforcing persistence conditions on the order parameter after a prescribed target time. This formulation enables simultaneous control of synchronization time and coherence level without assuming any explicit feedback law or solving a strict optimal control problem. Numerical studies on networked Kuramoto oscillators demonstrate smooth synchronization with reduced transient control effort and competitive cumulative cost relative to analytical baselines. The framework remains effective in non-gradient and frustrated dynamics, highlighting physics-informed neural control as a flexible trajectory-level approach to synchronization regulation.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00149v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Given a 4D symplectic map $F_0$ that has a normally hyperbolic invariant cylinder foliated by invariant tori, those with rational rotation numbers are themselves foliated by subharmonic periodic orbits (SPOs). If $F_0$ is part of a perturbative family $F_\\varepsilon$, one is often interested in computing those SPOs which persist for $\\varepsilon >0$. Assuming that a persisting SPO of $F_0$ has been identified, in this paper, we develop a quasi-Newton method which solves for the SPO simultaneously with its Floquet vectors and multipliers. This in turn enables continuation by the perturbation parameter $\\varepsilon$. The resulting SPO and Floquet vectors are then used to compute Taylor parameterizations of the SPO's weak stable and unstable manifolds, if they exist. Our quasi-Newton method is based on an adaptation of the parameterization method for invariant tori, with this paper being the first-ever to apply such a framework to directly compute periodic orbit points themselves. The new algorithm improves on efficiency compared to prior multi-shooting methods for SPOs, and notably applies to the case of stroboscopic maps of 2.5 DOF Hamiltonian flows resulting from periodic perturbations of 2 DOF systems. The tools have been successfully used for studies of resonant orbits in perturbed real-life celestial systems, the results of which are summarized as a demonstration of the methods' utility.",

A critical feature of this setting is the \"zero-mode singularity,\" where the Laplacian operator possesses a trivial zero eigenvalue ($\\lambda_0=0$), providing no linear dissipation for the spatial mean. We rigorously prove the global well-posedness of the system and the existence of a compact global attractor $\\mathcal{A}$ in the phase space $\\mathbb{H}=(L^2(\\Omega))^N$. Utilizing the Moser-Alikakos iteration technique, we establish uniform $L^\\infty(\\Omega)$ bounds, overcoming the lack of Sobolev embedding from $H^1$ into $L^\\infty$ in three dimensions. These bounds enable the derivation of explicit upper estimates for the fractal dimension of the attractor via the Kaplan-Yorke trace formula.

This yields a probabilistic CSG framework in which the planner first estimates a sparse value function from \\(T\\) episodes, then runs a CSG solver on the inferred coalition set.

Under a coherence condition and a minimum signal assumption, BGCP recovers the true set of profitable coalitions with high probability once \\(T \\gtrsim K \\log m\\), and hence yields welfare-optimal structures.

We present a formal model of CoinAlgs, with definitions of privacy (incomplete algorithm disclosure) and economic fairness (value extraction by an adversarial insider). We prove two complementary results that together demonstrate the CoinAlg Bind. First, privacy in a CoinAlg is a precondition for insider attacks on economic fairness. Conversely, in a game-theoretic model, lack of privacy, i.e., transparency, enables arbitrageurs to erode the profitability of a CoinAlg. Using data from Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, we empirically study both sides of the CoinAlg Bind. We quantify the impact of arbitrage against transparent CoinAlgs.

We design a computationally efficient algorithm derived from the MinScore algorithm, leveraging dynamic pruning and pattern caching to exactly calculate this metric during play. Opponent hand-modeling is also incorporated within a two-player zero-sum simulation framework, and the resulting strategies are evaluated using statistical hypothesis testing. Empirical results show significant improvement in win rates for MinDist-based agents over traditional heuristics, providing a formal and interpretable step toward algorithmic Rummy strategy design.",

    "title": "Bayesian Inverse Games with High-Dimensional Multi-Modal Observations",
    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00696v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Many multi-agent interaction scenarios can be naturally modeled as noncooperative games, where each agent's decisions depend on others' future actions. However, deploying game-theoretic planners for autonomous decision-making requires a specification of all agents' objectives. To circumvent this practical difficulty, recent work develops maximum likelihood techniques for solving inverse games that can identify unknown agent objectives from interaction data. Unfortunately, these methods only infer point estimates and do not quantify estimator uncertainty; correspondingly, downstream planning decisions can overconfidently commit to unsafe actions. We present an approximate Bayesian inference approach for solving the inverse game problem, which can incorporate observation data from multiple modalities and be used to generate samples from the Bayesian posterior over the hidden agent objectives given limited sensor observations in real time. Concretely, the proposed Bayesian inverse game framework trains a structured variational autoencoder with an embedded differentiable Nash game solver on interaction datasets and does not require labels of agents' true objectives. Extensive experiments show that our framework successfully learns prior and posterior distributions, improves inference quality over maximum likelihood estimation-based inverse game approaches, and enables safer downstream decision-making without sacrificing efficiency. When trajectory information is uninformative or unavailable, multimodal inference further reduces uncertainty by exploiting additional observation modalities.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2509.18673v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The existence of allocations that are fair and efficient, simultaneously, is a central inquiry in fair division literature. A prominent result in discrete fair division shows that the complementary desiderata of fairness and efficiency can be achieved together when allocating indivisible items with nonnegative values; specifically, for indivisible goods and among agents with additive valuations, there always exists an allocation that is both envy-free up to one item (EF1) and Pareto efficient (PO). While a recent breakthrough extends the EF1 and PO guarantee to indivisible chores (items with negative values), the question remains open for indivisible mixed manna, i.e., for indivisible items whose values can be positive, negative, or zero. The current work makes notable progress in resolving this central question.\n  For indivisible mixed manna and additive valuations, we establish the existence of allocations that are PO and introspectively envy-free up to one item (IEF1). In an IEF1 allocation, each agent can eliminate its envy towards all the other agents by either adding an item or removing an item from its own bundle. The notion of IEF1 coincides with EF1 for indivisible chores, and hence, our result generalizes the aforementioned existence guarantee for chores. Our techniques can be adopted to obtain an alternative proof for the existence of EF1 and PO allocations of indivisible goods. Hence, along with the result for mixed manna, we provide a unified approach for establishing the EF1 and PO guarantee for indivisible goods and indivisible chores. We also utilize our result for indivisible items to develop a distinct proof of the noted EF and PO guarantee for divisible mixed manna. Our work highlights an interesting application of the Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz (KKM) Theorem in discrete fair division and develops multiple, novel structural insights and algorithmic ideas.",

To this end, we introduce a class of models that interpolate between the short-range Anderson model on a random regular graph and fully connected models with statistically uniform hopping, by embedding a random regular graph into a complete graph and allowing hopping amplitudes to decay exponentially with graph distance. The competition between the exponentially growing number of neighbours with graph distance and the exponentially decaying hopping amplitude positions our models effectively as power-law hopping generalisation of the Anderson model on random regular graphs. Using a combination of numerical exact diagonalisation and analytical renormalised perturbation theory, we establish the resulting localisation phase diagram emerging from the interplay of the lengthscale associated to the hopping range and the onsite disorder strength. We find that increasing the hopping range shifts the localisation transition to stronger disorder, and that beyond a critical range the localised phase ceases to exist even at arbitrarily strong disorder. Our results indicate a direct Anderson transition between delocalised and localised phases, with no evidence for an intervening multifractal phase, for both deterministic and random hopping models. A scaling analysis based on inverse participation ratios reveals behaviour consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless-like transition with two-parameter scaling, in line with Anderson transitions on high-dimensional graphs. We also observe distinct critical behaviour in average and typical correlation functions, reflecting the different scaling properties of generalised inverse participation ratios.",

Intriguingly, power laws and weak forms of universality also pervade real-world datasets and deep learning models, motivating the application of RG ideas to the analysis of deep learning. In this work, we develop an RG framework to analyze self-similarity and its breakdown in learning curves for a class of weakly non-linear (non-lazy) neural networks trained on power-law distributed data. Features often neglected in standard treatments -- such as spectrum discreteness and lack of translation invariance -- lead to both quantitative and qualitative departures from conventional perturbative RG. In particular, we find that the concept of scaling intervals naturally replaces that of scaling dimensions. Despite these differences, the framework retains key RG features: it enables the classification of perturbations as relevant or irrelevant, and reveals a form of universality at large data limits, governed by a Gaussian Process-like UV fixed point.",

Simultaneous backscattering observations by the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) precisely constrain the comet's ~7 mag forward scattering brightening, enabling a direct comparison with the ~3 mag brightening of the more active but optically dust-poor comet 2P/Encke seen by SOHO and STEREO under similar geometry in 2017. Earlier STEREO observations from 2014 additionally show the newly recognized activity to be recurrent -- consistent with a reanalysis of the comet's associated meteor activity -- and has likely only been previously overlooked due to the comet's faintness and proximity to the Sun while active.

Even though no conclusive evidence has been found for atmospheres on small rocky exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs, recent JWST observations identified puzzling thermal emission excesses: some rocky exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs have dayside emission temperatures higher than the theoretical maximum. Theoretical maximum temperatures assume stellar irradiation as the sole energy source, implying that these planets may have internal heat sources. In this work, we simulate three possible planetary internal processes that may generate excessive heat in addition to stellar irradiation: residual heating from formation, tidal heating, and induction heating due to interactions with the stellar magnetic field. We found that these mechanisms, even when combined, cannot explain the observed thermal emission excesses, nor can they explain a tentative positive trend in the brightness temperature scaling factor as a function of irradiation temperature. Our results imply that planetary internal processes are unlikely to generate remotely detectable heat, so the observed thermal excesses, if astrophysical, are likely caused by stellar contamination, surface processes, or other internal processes not considered in this study.

Vertical mixing regulates this cooling. Our study examines how gravity waves or large-scale induced mixing interact with radiation transfer, affecting temperature inhomogeneity and internal flux. Through the radiative-convective-mixing equilibrium, mixing increases temperature inhomogeneity in the middle and lower atmospheres, redistributing internal flux. Stronger stellar radiation and mixing significantly reduce outgoing flux, slowing cooling. With constant infrared (IR) opacity, lower visible opacity and stronger mixing significantly reduce outgoing flux. Jensen's inequality implies that greater spatial disparities in stellar flux and opacity elevate the ratio of the average internal flux in inhomogeneous columns relative to that in homogeneous columns. This effect, particularly pronounced under high opacity contrasts, amplifies deep-layer temperature inhomogeneity and may enhance cooling. However, with mixing, overall cooling is weaker than without, as both the averaged internal flux of the inhomogeneous columns and that of the homogeneous column decline more sharply for the latter. Thus, while vertical mixing-induced inhomogeneity can enhance cooling, the overall cooling effect remains weaker than in the non-mixing case. Therefore, vertical mixing, by regulating atmospheric structure and flux, is key to understanding planetary cooling.",

The prevailing view for the origin of this three-body resonance involves the convergent migration of the moons, resulting from gas-driven torques in the circum-Jovian disk wherein they accreted. To account for Callisto's exclusion from the resonant chain, a late and/or slow accretion of the fourth and outermost Galilean moon is typically invoked, stalling its migration. Here, we consider an alternative scenario in which Callisto's nonresonant orbit is a consequence of disk substructure. Using a suite of N-body simulations that self-consistently account for satellite-disk interactions, we show that a pressure bump can function as a migration trap, isolating Callisto and alleviating constraints on its timing of accretion. Our simulations position the bump interior to the birthplaces of all four moons. In exploring the impact of bump structure on simulation outcomes, we find that it cannot be too sharp nor flat to yield the observed orbital architecture. In particular, a \"Goldilocks\" zone is mapped in parameter space, corresponding to a well-defined range in bump aspect ratio. Within this range, Io, Europa, and Ganymede are sequentially trapped at the bump, and ushered across it through resonant lockstep migration with their neighboring, exterior moon. The implications of our work are discussed in the context of uncertainties regarding Callisto's interior structure, arising from the possibility of non-hydrostatic contributions to its shape and gravity field, unresolved by the Galileo spacecraft.",

If $F_0$ is part of a perturbative family $F_\\varepsilon$, one is often interested in computing those SPOs which persist for $\\varepsilon >0$. Assuming that a persisting SPO of $F_0$ has been identified, in this paper, we develop a quasi-Newton method which solves for the SPO simultaneously with its Floquet vectors and multipliers. This in turn enables continuation by the perturbation parameter $\\varepsilon$. The resulting SPO and Floquet vectors are then used to compute Taylor parameterizations of the SPO's weak stable and unstable manifolds, if they exist. Our quasi-Newton method is based on an adaptation of the parameterization method for invariant tori, with this paper being the first-ever to apply such a framework to directly compute periodic orbit points themselves. The new algorithm improves on efficiency compared to prior multi-shooting methods for SPOs, and notably applies to the case of stroboscopic maps of 2.5 DOF Hamiltonian flows resulting from periodic perturbations of 2 DOF systems.

This field is close to the highest probability region of finding Planet Nine, according to simulations, but poorly constrained by previous searches. Our observations and search methodology, based on the detection of parallax position shifts between consecutive nights, work well in these conditions. We provide 85% confidence exclusion limits for objects with Sloan r-band magnitudes brighter than between 21.0 and 21.4, with an average sensitivity limit of 21.3. No credible Planet Nine candidates were identified within this field and magnitude limits. A caveat to our approach is that it would miss a candidate if its position were affected by scattered light from bright stars in at least one of the nights.

Our study complements prior searches, particularly those using archival survey data that are limited in the Galactic plane or at fainter brightness limits.

We demonstrate that thermal (canonical) observables for a whole closed quantum system of finite size can arise in the absence of a bath. These thermal observables stem from classical averaging over randomized unitary evolutions for a few-body system. The temperature in the canonical ensemble appears as a global constraint on the total energy of the system, determined by the choice of the initial state. From averaging randomized evolutions, we derive spin-spin correlation functions for a finite spin chain and show that they exhibit a temperature-dependent finite correlation length, in agreement with the prediction of the canonical ensemble. This establishes a method for computing thermal observables in a closed, finite-size system from real-time propagation without a bath.

For a Hamiltonian consisting of operators admitting rational number matrix representations, we prove a theorem that, if its center of commutant algebra have all eigenvalues being rational, the HSF from the ICPF method must be equal to or finer than that from the CA method. We show that this condition is satisfied by most known models exhibiting HSF, for which we demonstrate the validity of our theorem. We further discuss representative models for which ICPF and CA methods yield different HSFs. Our results may facilitate the exploration of a unified definition of HSF.",

We investigate this self-organization by simulating an ensemble of polar chiral active agents that couple locally via a Kuramoto interaction. We demonstrate that the system's transition from chaos to active turbulence is characterized by quantized loop phase currents and coherent clustering, and that this transition is strictly governed by a kinetic Turing instability. By deriving the continuum kinetic theory for the model, we identify that the competition between local phase-locking and active agent motility selects a critical structural wavenumber. The instability then drives the system into a state of developed, active turbulence that exhibits stable, robust power-laws in spectral density, suggestive of universality and consistent with observations from a broad range of turbulent phenomena. Our results bridge the gap between discrete chimera states and continuous fluid turbulence, suggesting that the statistical scaling laws of active turbulence can arise from fundamental kinetic instability criteria.",

Repeating this process by randomly sampling step length and turning angle defines a two-dimensional random walk in what we call comoving frame coordinates. This is precisely how Ross and Pearson proposed to model the movements of organisms more than a century ago. Decades later their concept was generalised by including persistence leading to a correlated random walk, which became a popular model in Movement Ecology. In contrast, Langevin equations describing cell migration and used in active matter theory are typically formulated by position and velocity in a fixed Cartesian frame. In this article, we explore the transformation of stochastic Langevin dynamics from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. We show that the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the Cartesian velocity of a walker can be transformed exactly into a stochastic process that is defined self-consistently in the comoving frame, thereby profoundly generalising correlated random walk models. This approach yields a general conceptual framework how to transform stochastic processes from the Cartesian into the comoving frame. Our theory paves the way to derive, invent and explore novel stochastic processes in the comoving frame for modelling the movements of organisms. It can also be applied to design novel stochastic dynamics for autonomously moving robots and drones.",

However, it is widely believed that topological properties are destroyed when the bulk energy gap closes, making it highly nontrivial to consider topology in gapless quantum critical systems. To address these challenges, recent advancements have sought to generalize the notion of topology to systems without a bulk energy gap, including quantum critical points and critical phases, collectively referred to as gapless symmetry-protected topological states. Extending topology to gapless quantum critical systems challenges the traditional belief in condensed matter physics that topological edge states are typically tied to the presence of a bulk energy gap. Furthermore, it suggests that topology plays a crucial role in classifying quantum phase transitions even if they belong to the same universality class, fundamentally enriching the textbook understanding of phase transitions. Given its importance, here we give a pedagogical review of the current progress of topological physics in quantum critical systems. We introduce the topological properties of quantum critical points and generalize them to stable critical phases, both for noninteracting and interacting systems. Additionally, we discuss further generalizations and future directions, including higher dimensions, nonequilibrium phase transitions, and realizations in modern experiments.",

To this end, we introduce a class of models that interpolate between the short-range Anderson model on a random regular graph and fully connected models with statistically uniform hopping, by embedding a random regular graph into a complete graph and allowing hopping amplitudes to decay exponentially with graph distance. The competition between the exponentially growing number of neighbours with graph distance and the exponentially decaying hopping amplitude positions our models effectively as power-law hopping generalisation of the Anderson model on random regular graphs. Using a combination of numerical exact diagonalisation and analytical renormalised perturbation theory, we establish the resulting localisation phase diagram emerging from the interplay of the lengthscale associated to the hopping range and the onsite disorder strength. We find that increasing the hopping range shifts the localisation transition to stronger disorder, and that beyond a critical range the localised phase ceases to exist even at arbitrarily strong disorder. Our results indicate a direct Anderson transition between delocalised and localised phases, with no evidence for an intervening multifractal phase, for both deterministic and random hopping models. A scaling analysis based on inverse participation ratios reveals behaviour consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless-like transition with two-parameter scaling, in line with Anderson transitions on high-dimensional graphs. We also observe distinct critical behaviour in average and typical correlation functions, reflecting the different scaling properties of generalised inverse participation ratios.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00266v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recent advances in quantum simulators allow direct experimental access to the ensemble of pure states generated by measuring part of an isolated quantum many-body system. These projected ensembles encode fine-grained information beyond thermal expectation values and provide a new window into quantum thermalization. In chaotic dynamics, projected ensembles exhibit universal statistics, a phenomenon known as deep thermalization. While infinite-temperature systems generate Haar-random ensembles, realistic physical constraints such as finite temperature or conservation laws require a more general framework. It has been proposed that deep thermalization is governed in general by the emergence of Scrooge ensembles, maximally entropic distributions of pure states consistent with the underlying constraints. Here we provide rigorous arguments supporting this proposal. To characterize this universal behavior, we invoke Scrooge $k$-designs, which approximate Scrooge ensembles, and identify three physically distinct mechanisms for their emergence. First, global Scrooge designs can arise from long-time chaotic unitary dynamics alone, without the need for measurements. Second, if the global state is highly scrambled, a local Scrooge design is induced when the complementary subsystem is measured. Third, a local Scrooge ensemble arises from an arbitrary entangled state when the complementary system is measured in a highly scrambled basis. Numerical simulations across a range of many-body systems identify coherence, entanglement, non-stabilizerness, and information scrambling as essential resources for the emergence of Scrooge-like behavior. Taken together, our results establish a unified theoretical framework for the emergence of maximally entropic, information-stingy randomness in quantum many-body systems.",

Despite its importance, current formulations rely mainly on spectral or pseudo-inverse Laplacian representations, offering limited physical insight into how structural features shape this quantity or how it can be efficiently optimized. Here, we establish an exact and physically transparent relationship between effective graph resistance and the cumulative heat dissipation generated by Laplacian diffusion dynamics. We show that the total heat dissipated during relaxation to equilibrium precisely equals the effective graph resistance. This dynamical viewpoint uncovers a natural multi-scale decomposition of the Laplacian spectrum: early-time dissipation is governed by degree-based local structure, intermediate times isolate eigenvalues below the spectral mean, and long times are dominated by the algebraic connectivity. These multi-scale properties yield continuous and interpretable strategies for modifying network structure and constructing optimized ensembles, enabling improvements that are otherwise NP-hard to achieve via combinatorial methods. Our results unify structural and dynamical perspectives on network connectivity and provide new tools for analyzing, comparing, and optimizing complex networks across domains.",

In many biological and soft-matter systems, distinct components of the medium exhibit unique viscoelastic responses, resulting in time-dependent changes in the observed diffusion exponents. Here, we develop a theoretical model of two particles, each embedded in a distinct viscoelastic medium, and coupled via a harmonic potential. By formulating and solving a system of coupled fractional Langevin equations (FLEs) with memory exponents $0<\\alpha<\\beta\\leq 1$, we uncover rich transient anomalous diffusion phenomena arising from the interplay of memory kernels and bilinear coupling.

This recovery emerges only when memory exponents differ ($\\alpha<\\beta$), whereas identical exponents ($\\alpha=\\beta$) suppress recovery.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.04164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Recent advances in combining Clifford circuits with tensor-network (TN) methods have shown that classically simulable disentanglers can suppress substantial portions of the entanglement structure, effectively alleviating the bond-dimension bottleneck in TN simulations. In this work, we develop a variational TN framework based on Grassmann tensor networks, which natively encode fermionic statistics while preserving locality. By incorporating locally defined Clifford circuits within the fermionic formalism, we simulate benchmark models including the tight-binding and $t$-$V$ models. Our results show that Clifford disentangling removes the classically simulable component of entanglement, leading to a reduced bond dimension and improved accuracy in ground-state energy estimates. Interestingly, once the natural Grassmann-evenness requirement of the fermionic formulation is taken into account and Clifford gates with identical entanglement action are grouped together, the original set of 11520 two-qubit Clifford gates reduces to only 12 distinct gates. This strong reduction leads to a more efficient disentangling scheme within the fermionic framework. These findings highlight the potential of Clifford-augmented Grassmann TNs as a scalable and accurate tool for studying strongly correlated fermionic systems, particularly in higher dimensions.",

Complementing the full quantum treatment, we examine the classical backbone of this onset of chaos by employing semiclassical ray dynamics.

The obtained data can be used for various purposes: system analysis, design of mathematical models, or construction of reduced-order models for further simulations under different loading conditions. The use of data for reduced-order modeling is an important developing research direction, especially when the high-dimensional system operators are unknown and their low-dimensional approximation is required for accurate but fast simulations. Our goal is to obtain the low-dimensional surrogate model from the available input signal and deformation trajectory data, capturing the correct system behavior for the basic deformation cases, namely bending and rotation, which are present in almost every complex mechanical system.\n  In this work, we propose a methodology to infer the system operators by solving a nonlinear unconstrained optimization problem. The methodology is based on the operator inference approach for second-order systems and includes a parametrization of the unknown operators that preserves their symmetric positive definite or skew-symmetric structure. We demonstrate the performance of the novel approach for three numerical examples that are used to simulate basic bending and rotating.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00149v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Given a 4D symplectic map $F_0$ that has a normally hyperbolic invariant cylinder foliated by invariant tori, those with rational rotation numbers are themselves foliated by subharmonic periodic orbits (SPOs). If $F_0$ is part of a perturbative family $F_\\varepsilon$, one is often interested in computing those SPOs which persist for $\\varepsilon >0$. Assuming that a persisting SPO of $F_0$ has been identified, in this paper, we develop a quasi-Newton method which solves for the SPO simultaneously with its Floquet vectors and multipliers. This in turn enables continuation by the perturbation parameter $\\varepsilon$. The resulting SPO and Floquet vectors are then used to compute Taylor parameterizations of the SPO's weak stable and unstable manifolds, if they exist. Our quasi-Newton method is based on an adaptation of the parameterization method for invariant tori, with this paper being the first-ever to apply such a framework to directly compute periodic orbit points themselves. The new algorithm improves on efficiency compared to prior multi-shooting methods for SPOs, and notably applies to the case of stroboscopic maps of 2.5 DOF Hamiltonian flows resulting from periodic perturbations of 2 DOF systems. The tools have been successfully used for studies of resonant orbits in perturbed real-life celestial systems, the results of which are summarized as a demonstration of the methods' utility.",

The dynamics are generated by a random elliptic community matrix with tunable correlation strength. We show that, independent of the correlation strength, solutions of the system are confined to subsets of the phase space that can be cast as time-varying Gardner volumes from the theory of learning in neural networks. These volumes decrease with the diversity (i.e. the fraction of extant species) and become exponentially small in the long-time limit. Using standard results from random matrix theory, the changing diversity is then linked to a sequence of contractions and expansions in the spectrum of the community matrix over time, resulting in a sequence of May-type stability problems determining whether the total population evolves toward complete extinction or unbounded growth. In the case of unbounded growth, we show the model allows for a particularly simple nonlinear extension in which the solutions instead evolve towards a new attractor.",

Programmable memristive hardware offers a promising substrate for such post-deployment adaptation; however, practical realization is challenged by limited weight resolution, device variability, nonlinear programming dynamics, and finite device endurance. In this work, we show that spiking neural networks (SNNs) can be deployed on ferroelectric memristive synaptic devices for adaptive EEG-based motor imagery decoding under realistic device constraints. We fabricate, characterize, and model ferroelectric synapses. We evaluate a convolutional-recurrent SNN architecture under two complementary deployment strategies: (i) device-aware training using a ferroelectric synapse model, and (ii) transfer of software-trained weights followed by low-overhead on-device re-tuning. To enable efficient adaptation, we introduce a device-aware weight-update strategy in which gradient-based updates are accumulated digitally and converted into discrete programming events only when a threshold is exceeded, emulating nonlinear, state-dependent programming dynamics while reducing programming frequency. Both deployment strategies achieve classification performance comparable to state-of-the-art software-based SNNs. Furthermore, subject-specific transfer learning achieved by retraining only the final network layers improves classification accuracy. These results demonstrate that programmable ferroelectric hardware can support robust, low-overhead adaptation in spiking neural networks, opening a practical path toward personalized neuromorphic processing of neural signals.",

In fact, modern AI architectures increasingly embody neuromorphic principles through heavily quantized activations, state-space dynamics, and sparse attention mechanisms. This paper elaborates on the connections between neuromorphic models, state-space models, and transformer architectures through the lens of the distinction between intra-token processing and inter-token processing. Most early work on neuromorphic AI was based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for intra-token processing, i.e., for transformations involving multiple channels, or features, of the same vector input, such as the pixels of an image. In contrast, more recent research has explored how neuromorphic principles can be leveraged to design efficient inter-token processing methods, which selectively combine different information elements depending on their contextual relevance. Implementing associative memorization mechanisms, these approaches leverage state-space dynamics or sparse self-attention. Along with a systematic presentation of modern neuromorphic AI models through the lens of intra-token and inter-token processing, training methodologies for neuromorphic AI models are also reviewed. These range from surrogate gradients leveraging parallel convolutional processing to local learning rules based on reinforcement learning mechanisms.",

This work explores computational principles derived from astrocytes-glial cells critical for biological memory and synaptic modulation-as a complementary approach to conventional architectural modifications for efficient self-attention. We introduce the Recurrent Memory Augmented Astromorphic Transformer (RMAAT), an architecture integrating abstracted astrocyte functionalities. RMAAT employs a recurrent, segment-based processing strategy where persistent memory tokens propagate contextual information. An adaptive compression mechanism, governed by a novel retention factor derived from simulated astrocyte long-term plasticity (LTP), modulates these tokens. Attention within segments utilizes an efficient, linear-complexity mechanism inspired by astrocyte short-term plasticity (STP). Training is performed using Astrocytic Memory Replay Backpropagation (AMRB), a novel algorithm designed for memory efficiency in recurrent networks. Evaluations on the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark demonstrate RMAAT's competitive accuracy and substantial improvements in computational and memory efficiency, indicating the potential of incorporating astrocyte-inspired dynamics into scalable sequence models.",

ERP plays a critical role in cognitive analysis, the detection of neurological diseases, and the assessment of psychological states. Recent years have seen substantial advances in deep learning-based methods for spontaneous EEG and other non-time-locked task-related EEG signals. However, their effectiveness on ERP data remains underexplored, and many existing ERP studies still rely heavily on manually extracted features. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark study that systematically compares traditional manual features (followed by a linear classifier), deep learning models, and pre-trained EEG foundation models for ERP analysis. We establish a unified data preprocessing and training pipeline and evaluate these approaches on two representative tasks, ERP stimulus classification and ERP-based brain disease detection, across 12 publicly available datasets. Furthermore, we investigate various patch-embedding strategies within advanced Transformer architectures to identify embedding designs that better suit ERP data. Our study provides a landmark framework to guide method selection and tailored model design for future ERP analysis. The code is available at https://github.com/DL4mHealth/ERP-Benchmark.",

Learnable parameters that delay spike times can improve classification performance in temporal tasks, but existing methods rely on large networks and offline learning, making them unsuitable for real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we introduce synaptic and axonal delays to leaky integrate and fire (LIF)-based feedforward and recurrent SNNs, and propose three-factor learning rules to simultaneously learn delay parameters online. We employ a smooth Gaussian surrogate to approximate spike derivatives exclusively for the eligibility trace calculation, and together with a top-down error signal determine parameter updates. Our experiments show that incorporating delays improves accuracy by up to 20% over a weights-only baseline, and for networks with similar parameter counts, jointly learning weights and delays yields up to 14% higher accuracy. On the SHD speech recognition dataset, our method achieves similar accuracy to offline backpropagation-based approaches. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, it reduces model size by 6.6x and inference latency by 67%, with only a 2.4% drop in classification accuracy.

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00679v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been emerging as prominent AI models for solving many natural language tasks due to their high performance (e.g., accuracy) and capabilities in generating high-quality responses to the given inputs. However, their large computational cost, huge memory footprints, and high processing power/energy make it challenging for their embedded deployments. Amid several tinyLLMs, recent works have proposed spike-driven language models (SLMs) for significantly reducing the processing power/energy of LLMs. However, their memory footprints still remain too large for low-cost and resource-constrained embedded devices. Manual quantization approach may effectively compress SLM memory footprints, but it requires a huge design time and compute power to find the quantization setting for each network, hence making this approach not-scalable for handling different networks, performance requirements, and memory budgets. To bridge this gap, we propose QSLM, a novel framework that performs automated quantization for compressing pre-trained SLMs, while meeting the performance and memory constraints. To achieve this, QSLM first identifies the hierarchy of the given network architecture and the sensitivity of network layers under quantization, then employs a tiered quantization strategy (e.g., global-, block-, and module-level quantization) while leveraging a multi-objective performance-and-memory trade-off function to select the final quantization setting. Experimental results indicate that our QSLM reduces memory footprint by up to 86.5%, reduces power consumption by up to 20%, maintains high performance across different tasks (i.e., by up to 84.4% accuracy of sentiment classification on the SST-2 dataset and perplexity score of 23.2 for text generation on the WikiText-2 dataset) close to the original non-quantized model while meeting the performance and memory constraints.",

The system consists of a set of serial processing tasks, each with a given duration, unit execution cost, and precedence constraints, which must be assigned to an unlimited number of stations subject to a per-station duration bound. The objective is to minimize the total production cost, modeled as a station-wise function of task costs and the duration bound, while strictly satisfying all prerequisite and capacity constraints. Two chromosome encoding strategies are investigated: a station-based representation implemented using the JGAP library with SuperGene validity checks, and a task-based representation in which genes encode station assignments directly. For each encoding, standard GA operators (crossover, mutation, selection, and replacement) are adapted to preserve feasibility and drive the population toward lower-cost schedules. Experimental results on three classes of precedence structures-tightly coupled, loosely coupled, and uncoupled-demonstrate that the task-based encoding yields smoother convergence and more reliable cost minimization than the station-based encoding, particularly when the number of valid schedules is large. The study highlights the advantages of GA over gradient-based and analytical methods for combinatorial scheduling problems, especially in the presence of complex constraints and non-differentiable cost landscapes.",

AEs are minimally perturbed input data undetectable to humans posing significant risks to security-dependent applications. Hence, extensive research has been undertaken to develop defense mechanisms that mitigate their threats. Most existing methods primarily focus on discriminating AEs based on the input sample features, emphasizing AE detection without addressing the correct sample categorization before an attack. While some tasks may only require mere rejection on detected AEs, others necessitate identifying the correct original input category such as traffic sign recognition in autonomous driving. The objective of this study is to propose a method for rectifying AEs to estimate the correct labels of their original inputs. Our method is based on re-attacking AEs to move them beyond the decision boundary for accurate label prediction, effectively addressing the issue of rectifying minimally perceptible AEs created using white-box attack methods. However, challenge remains with respect to effectively rectifying AEs produced by black-box attacks at a distance from the boundary, or those misclassified into low-confidence categories by targeted attacks. By adopting a straightforward approach of only considering AEs as inputs, the proposed method can address diverse attacks while avoiding the requirement of parameter adjustments or preliminary training. Results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits consistent performance in rectifying AEs generated via various attack methods, including targeted and black-box attacks. Moreover, it outperforms conventional rectification and input transformation methods in terms of stability against various attacks.",

Designing paint paths for these robotic arms, which involves assigning car body areas to arms and determining paint sequences for each arm, remains a time-consuming manual task for engineers, indicating the demand for automation and design time reduction. The unique constraints of the painting process hinder the direct application of conventional robotic path planning techniques, such as those used in welding. Therefore, this paper formulates the design of paint paths as a hierarchical optimization problem, where the upper-layer subproblem resembles a vehicle routing problem (VRP), and the lower-layer subproblem involves detailed path planning. This approach allows the use of different optimization algorithms at each layer, and permits flexible handling of constraints specific to the vehicle painting process through the design of variable representation, constraints, repair operators, and an initialization process at the upper and lower layers. Experiments with three commercially available vehicle models demonstrated that the proposed method can automatically design paths that satisfy all constraints for vehicle painting with quality comparable to those created manually by engineers.",

Inspired by these capabilities, this paper introduces ReCiSt, a bio-inspired agentic self-healing framework designed to achieve resilience in Distributed Computing Continuum Systems (DCCS). Modern DCCS integrate heterogeneous computing resources, ranging from resource-constrained IoT devices to high-performance cloud infrastructures, and their inherent complexity, mobility, and dynamic operating conditions expose them to frequent faults that disrupt service continuity. These challenges underscore the need for scalable, adaptive, and self-regulated resilience strategies. ReCiSt reconstructs the biological phases of Hemostasis, Inflammation, Proliferation, and Remodeling into the computational layers Containment, Diagnosis, Meta-Cognitive, and Knowledge for DCCS. These four layers perform autonomous fault isolation, causal diagnosis, adaptive recovery, and long-term knowledge consolidation through Language Model (LM)-powered agents. These agents interpret heterogeneous logs, infer root causes, refine reasoning pathways, and reconfigure resources with minimal human intervention. The proposed ReCiSt framework is evaluated on public fault datasets using multiple LMs, and no baseline comparison is included due to the scarcity of similar approaches. Nevertheless, our results, evaluated under different LMs, confirm ReCiSt's self-healing capabilities within tens of seconds with minimum of 10% of agent CPU usage.

Recent work proposing a framework for training BNNs based on quadratic unconstrained binary optimisation (QUBO) and progress in the design of Ising machines for solving QUBO problems suggest a potential path to efficiently optimising discrete neural networks. In this work, we extend existing QUBO models for training BNNs to accommodate arbitrary network topologies and propose two novel methods for regularisation. The first method maximises neuron margins biasing the training process toward parameter configurations that yield larger pre-activation magnitudes. The second method employs a dropout-inspired iterative scheme in which reduced subnetworks are trained and used to adjust linear penalties on network parameters. We apply the proposed QUBO formulation to a small binary image classification problem and conduct computational experiments on a GPU-based Ising machine.

However, NAS suffers from a critical bottleneck, i.e. the evaluation of numerous architectures during the search process demands substantial computing resources and time. In order to improve the efficiency of NAS, a series of methods have been proposed to reduce the evaluation time of neural architectures. However, they are not efficient enough and still only focus on the accuracy of architectures. Beyond classification accuracy, real-world applications increasingly demand more efficient and compact network architectures that balance multiple performance criteria. To address these challenges, we propose the SMEMNAS, a pairwise comparison relation-assisted multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on a multi-population mechanism. In the SMEMNAS, a surrogate model is constructed based on pairwise comparison relations to predict the accuracy ranking of architectures, rather than the absolute accuracy. Moreover, two populations cooperate with each other in the search process, i.e. a main population that guides the evolutionary process, while a vice population that enhances search diversity. Our method aims to discover high-performance models that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives. We conduct comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets to validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Methods synergizing gradient descent and EAs for discovering bespoke neural architectures and balancing multiple terms in physics-informed learning objectives are positioned as important avenues for future research.

Babies start learning to move in the restricted liquid area called placenta. Children often are limited by underdeveloped body. Even adults are not allowed to participate in complex competitions right away. However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. \"Swaddling\" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms.

The study explores the necessary conditions for commutation relations to hold, clarifying their impact on the consistency of the derived equations of motion. By detailing the interplay between these variational identities and the Lagrangian derivatives of constraint functions, we elucidate the differences between equations of motion formulated via the d'Alembert--Lagrange principle and those obtained from extended time-integral variational principles.

This intuition is rigorously underpinned by Lieb-Robinson bounds that state that locally interacting Hamiltonians with finite-dimensional constituents on suitably regular lattices always exhibit such a finite group velocity. This also implies that causality is always respected by the dynamics of quantum lattice models. It had been a long-standing open question whether interacting bosonic systems also feature finite speeds of sound in information and particle propagation, which was only recently resolved. This work proves a strikingly simple such bound for particle propagation - shown in literally a few elementary, yet not straightforward, lines - for generalized Bose-Hubbard models defined on general lattices, proving that appropriately locally perturbed stationary states feature a finite speed of sound in particle numbers.",

A natural question arises: given a countable cardinal $\\kappa$, which is the event space of the $\\kappa$-times repeated experiment? In the case of classical experiments, where $\\mathsf{E}$ is a (complete) Boolean algebra on some set $S$, i.e. a \\textit{classical }or\\textit{ distributive logic}, the answer is more and less known: the (complete) Boolean algebra on $S^{\\kappa}$ generated by $\\mathsf{E}^{\\kappa}$. But, what if $\\mathsf{E}$ is not a Boolean algebra? In this paper we give a constructive answer to this question for any $\\kappa$ and in the context of general orthocomplemented complete lattices, i.e. \\textit{general logics}. Concretely, given a general logic $\\mathsf{E}$ defining the event space of a given experiment, we construct a logic $\\mathsf{U}_{\\kappa}\\left(\\mathsf{E}\\right)$ representing the event space of the $\\kappa$-times repeated experiment, in such a way that $\\mathsf{U}_{\\kappa}\\left(\\mathsf{E}\\right)$ and $\\mathsf{E}$ are isomorphic if $\\kappa=1$, and such that $\\mathsf{U}_{\\kappa}\\left(\\mathsf{E}\\right)$ is distributive if and only if so is $\\mathsf{E}$.

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00266v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recent advances in quantum simulators allow direct experimental access to the ensemble of pure states generated by measuring part of an isolated quantum many-body system. These projected ensembles encode fine-grained information beyond thermal expectation values and provide a new window into quantum thermalization. In chaotic dynamics, projected ensembles exhibit universal statistics, a phenomenon known as deep thermalization. While infinite-temperature systems generate Haar-random ensembles, realistic physical constraints such as finite temperature or conservation laws require a more general framework. It has been proposed that deep thermalization is governed in general by the emergence of Scrooge ensembles, maximally entropic distributions of pure states consistent with the underlying constraints. Here we provide rigorous arguments supporting this proposal. To characterize this universal behavior, we invoke Scrooge $k$-designs, which approximate Scrooge ensembles, and identify three physically distinct mechanisms for their emergence. First, global Scrooge designs can arise from long-time chaotic unitary dynamics alone, without the need for measurements. Second, if the global state is highly scrambled, a local Scrooge design is induced when the complementary subsystem is measured. Third, a local Scrooge ensemble arises from an arbitrary entangled state when the complementary system is measured in a highly scrambled basis. Numerical simulations across a range of many-body systems identify coherence, entanglement, non-stabilizerness, and information scrambling as essential resources for the emergence of Scrooge-like behavior. Taken together, our results establish a unified theoretical framework for the emergence of maximally entropic, information-stingy randomness in quantum many-body systems.",

The inclusion of a QPC breaks electron-hole (e-h) symmetry, leading to a finite thermovoltage. In contrast, earlier studies on hybrid junctions incorporating insulating barriers, as e-h symmetry is preserved, have vanishing thermovoltage, and consequently, $\\Delta_T$ noise is calculated at zero thermovoltage. In our setup, the broken e-h symmetry allows for a finite thermovoltage, at which we compute the corresponding $\\Delta_T$ noise. Unlike earlier studies restricted by e-h symmetry and vanishing thermovoltage, our work establishes a self-consistent framework in mesoscopic hybrid junctions, revealing how Andreev reflection fundamentally reshapes $\\Delta_T$ noise once e-h symmetry is broken. This broad access to charge fluctuation signatures provides a more comprehensive understanding of non-equilibrium transport in linear response. To our knowledge, this work provides the first self-consistent analysis of $\\Delta_T$ noise in superconducting hybrid junctions where e-h symmetry is broken, explicitly revealing how Andreev reflection modifies $\\Delta_T$ noise beyond the symmetry-protected zero-thermovoltage regime.",

In the finite volume scaling limit, they further reduce to the Binet's second integral for the gamma function logarithm and its Hermite's generalization. As such, all the matrix elements in the scaling limit allow simple product formulas in terms of the gamma function at integer and half-integer arguments, and are rational numbers up to $\\sqrt{2}$. They are exactly the spin-operator form factors of the Ising CFT in the fermionic basis, whose explicit forms are much less well known in comparison to the finite-volume form factors in the massive theory.

Through Noether's theorem in reverse, the LRL vector gives rise to a corresponding infinitesimal dynamical symmetry on the kinematical variables, which is well known in the literature. However, the physically relevant part of the LRL vector is its direction angle in the plane of motion (since its magnitude is just a function of energy and angular momentum). The present work derives the infinitesimal dynamical symmetry corresponding to the direction part of the LRL vector, and obtains the explicit form of the symmetry transformations that it generates. When combined with the rotation symmetries,the resulting symmetry group is shown to be the semi-direct product of $SO(3)$ and $R^3$. This stands in contrast to the $SO(4)$ symmetry group generated by the LRL symmetries and the rotations. As a by-product, the action of the new infinitesimal symmetries on all of the conserved quanties is obtained.

We define resonant energy levels; roughly speaking, these are levels for which the resonance phenomenon occurs more often than rarely. We focus on unimodal analytic potentials with the minimum at zero. The most important result of the work describes the size of the set of resonance levels in the form of the following trichotomy: it is mostly empty or is one-element or is large, i.e. non-empty and open. In this latter case, we show that an abundance of resonant orbits occurs only when the potentials are of a special type; we denote this family by $\\mathcal{SP}$.

Based on this isomorphism, we propose a unified, physics-informed framework for kernel selection and design. For systems with known propagator forms, we derive analytical selection rules that map standard kernels to physical operators. For complex systems where the Green's function is analytically intractable, we introduce a constructive numerical method using the Kernel Polynomial Method with Jackson smoothing to generate custom, physics-aligned kernels.

We show that this guarantee does not extend to the asymptotic regime. As N -> infinity, the multiplicative groups Omega_N = (Z/NZ)^x form a non-tight family of probability spaces, and the probability weight associated with successful bases, proportional to p(success | a', N) p(a' | N), decays as 1/phi(N). The ensemble of uniform measures {mu_N} therefore admits no weak limit, implying an asymptotic loss of ergodicity. Monte Carlo simulations up to N <= 10^6 confirm this decay and the absence of a stationary success probability. These results demonstrate that the \"expected polynomial time\" in order finding is only locally defined: no global expectation exists once the arithmetic domain expands. The asymptotic vanishing of success probability explains the empirical absence of large-N implementations of Shor's algorithm and sets a fundamental limit on the scalability of quantum factoring.",

Consequently, the electric field is also governed by a radially symmetric potential, and its effects are expected to act radially symmetrically. The main result express the electric field and its effect on the charge density as concrete functions.

Performance benchmarking is first performed using the Powell singular function, a well-established test case exhibiting challenging properties including Hessian singularity at the global minimum. The algorithms are then applied to Hartree-Fock-Roothaan self-consistent-field energy functionals, which define a highly non-convex optimization landscape due to the nonlinear coupling of orbital parameters.

We present a unified 13-tuple Extended Bio-PN formalism integrating two complementary theories: Weak Independence Theory (enabling coupled parallelism despite place-sharing) and Signal Hierarchy Theory (separating information flow from mass transfer). The extended definition adds signal partition (Psi subset P), arc type classification (A), regulatory structure (Sigma), environmental exchange (Theta), dependency taxonomy (Delta), heterogeneous transition types (tau), and biochemical formula tracking (rho). We formalize signal token consumption semantics through two-phase execution (enabling vs. consumption) and prove weak independence correctness for continuous dynamics. Application to Vibrio fischeri quorum sensing demonstrates how energy metabolism (ENERGY signals) orchestrates binary ON/OFF decisions through hierarchical constraint propagation to regulatory signals (LuxR-AHL complex), with 133-fold difference separating states.

However, this paradigm faces two critical bottlenecks: the prohibitive memory footprint required for local training on resource-constrained gNBs, and the saturation of bandwidth-limited backhaul links during the global aggregation of high-dimensional model updates. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-Fed, a novel Compression and Combination-based Federated learning framework that unifies local memory efficiency and global communication reduction. Locally, CoCo-Fed breaks the memory wall by performing a double-dimension down-projection of gradients, adapting the optimizer to operate on low-rank structures without introducing additional inference parameters/latency. Globally, we introduce a transmission protocol based on orthogonal subspace superposition, where layer-wise updates are projected and superimposed into a single consolidated matrix per gNB, drastically reducing the backhaul traffic.

    "title": "Universal Outlier Hypothesis Testing via Mean- and Median-Based Tests",
    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00712v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Universal outlier hypothesis testing refers to a hypothesis testing problem where one observes a large number of length-$n$ sequences -- the majority of which are distributed according to the typical distribution $\\pi$ and a small number are distributed according to the outlier distribution $\\mu$ -- and one wishes to decide, which of these sequences are outliers without having knowledge of $\\pi$ and $\\mu$. In contrast to previous works, in this paper it is assumed that both the number of observation sequences and the number of outlier sequences grow with the sequence length. In this case, the typical distribution $\\pi$ can be estimated by computing the mean over all observation sequences, provided that the number of outlier sequences is sublinear in the total number of sequences. It is demonstrated that, in this case, one can achieve the error exponent of the maximum likelihood test that has access to both $\\pi$ and $\\mu$. However, this mean-based test performs poorly when the number of outlier sequences is proportional to the total number of sequences. For this case, a median-based test is proposed that estimates $\\pi$ as the median of all observation sequences. It is demonstrated that the median-based test achieves again the error exponent of the maximum likelihood test that has access to both $\\pi$ and $\\mu$, but only with probability approaching one. To formalize this case, the typical error exponent -- similar to the typical random coding exponent introduced in the context of random coding for channel coding -- is proposed.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00242v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Realizing the full potential of quantum computation requires Quantum Error Correction (QEC). QEC reduces error rates by encoding logical information across redundant physical qubits, enabling errors to be detected and corrected. A common decoder used for this task is Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) a graph-based algorithm that relies on edge weights to identify the most likely error chains. In this work, we propose a data-driven decoder named Neural Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (NMWPM). Our decoder utilizes a hybrid architecture that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to extract local syndrome features and Transformers to capture long-range global dependencies, which are then used to predict dynamic edge weights for the MWPM decoder. To facilitate training through the non-differentiable MWPM algorithm, we formulate a novel proxy loss function that enables end-to-end optimization. Our findings demonstrate significant performance reduction in the Logical Error Rate (LER) over standard baselines, highlighting the advantage of hybrid decoders that combine the predictive capabilities of neural networks with the algorithmic structure of classical matching.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00245v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has brought novel data processing and generative capabilities but also escalating energy requirements. This challenge motivates renewed interest in neuromorphic computing principles, which promise brain-like efficiency through discrete and sparse activations, recurrent dynamics, and non-linear feedback. In fact, modern AI architectures increasingly embody neuromorphic principles through heavily quantized activations, state-space dynamics, and sparse attention mechanisms. This paper elaborates on the connections between neuromorphic models, state-space models, and transformer architectures through the lens of the distinction between intra-token processing and inter-token processing. Most early work on neuromorphic AI was based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for intra-token processing, i.e., for transformations involving multiple channels, or features, of the same vector input, such as the pixels of an image. In contrast, more recent research has explored how neuromorphic principles can be leveraged to design efficient inter-token processing methods, which selectively combine different information elements depending on their contextual relevance. Implementing associative memorization mechanisms, these approaches leverage state-space dynamics or sparse self-attention. Along with a systematic presentation of modern neuromorphic AI models through the lens of intra-token and inter-token processing, training methodologies for neuromorphic AI models are also reviewed. These range from surrogate gradients leveraging parallel convolutional processing to local learning rules based on reinforcement learning mechanisms.",

    "title": "When Does Quantum Differential Privacy Compose?",
    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00337v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Composition is a cornerstone of classical differential privacy, enabling strong end-to-end guarantees for complex algorithms through composition theorems (e.g., basic and advanced). In the quantum setting, however, privacy is defined operationally against arbitrary measurements, and classical composition arguments based on scalar privacy-loss random variables no longer apply. As a result, it has remained unclear when meaningful composition guarantees can be obtained for quantum differential privacy (QDP).\n  In this work, we clarify both the limitations and possibilities of composition in the quantum setting. We first show that classical-style composition fails in full generality for POVM-based approximate QDP: even quantum channels that are individually perfectly private can completely lose privacy when combined through correlated joint implementations. We then identify a setting in which clean composition guarantees can be restored. For tensor-product channels acting on product neighboring inputs, we introduce a quantum moments accountant based on an operator-valued notion of privacy loss and a matrix moment-generating function. Although the resulting R\\'enyi-type divergence does not satisfy a data-processing inequality, we prove that controlling its moments suffices to bound measured R\\'enyi divergence, yielding operational privacy guarantees against arbitrary measurements. This leads to advanced-composition-style bounds with the same leading-order behavior as in the classical theory.\n  Our results demonstrate that meaningful composition theorems for quantum differential privacy require carefully articulated structural assumptions on channels, inputs, and adversarial measurements, and provide a principled framework for understanding which classical ideas do and do not extend to the quantum setting.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00502v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The impact of both multiplicative and additive hardware impairments (HWIs) on multiple-input multiple-output affine frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-AFDM) systems is investigated. For small-scale MIMO-AFDM systems, a tight bit error rate (BER) upper bound associated with the maximum likelihood (ML) detector is derived. By contrast, for large-scale systems, a closed-form BER approximation associated with the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) detector is presented, including realistic imperfect channel estimation scenarios. Our first key observation is that the full diversity order of a hardware-impaired AFDM system remains unaffected, which is a unique advantage. Furthermore, our analysis shows that 1) the BER results derived accurately predict the simulated ML performance in moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while the theoretical BER curve of the LMMSE detector closely matches that of the Monte-Carlo based one. 2) MIMO-AFDM is more resilient to multiplicative distortions, such as phase noise and carrier frequency offset, compared to its orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) counterparts. This is attributed to its inherent chirp signal characteristics; 3) MIMO-AFDM consistently achieves superior BER performance compared to conventional MIMO-OFDM systems under the same additive HWI conditions, as well as different velocity values. The latter is because MIMO-AFDM is also resilient to the additional inter-carrier interference (ICI) imposed by the nonlinear distortions of additive HWIs. In a nutshell, compared to OFDM, AFDM demonstrates stronger ICI resilience and achieves the maximum full diversity attainable gain even under HWIs, thanks to its intrinsic chirp signalling structure as well as to the beneficial spreading effect of the discrete affine Fourier transform.",

Traditional copper and optical wiring face fundamental challenges in latency, power consumption, and rigidity, constraining the scalability of distributed AI clusters. This article introduces a vision for Terahertz (THz) Wireless Data Center (THz-WDC) that combines ultra-broadband capacity, one-hop low-latency communication, and energy efficiency in the short-to-medium range (1-100m). Performance and technical requirements are first articulated, including up to 1 Tbps per link, aggregate throughput up to 10 Tbps via spatial multiplexing, sub-50 ns single-hop latency, and sub-10 pJ/bit energy efficiency over 20m. To achieve these ambitious goals, key enabling technologies are explored, including digital-twin-based orchestration, low-complexity beam manipulation technologies, all-silicon THz transceivers, and low-complexity analog baseband architectures. Moreover, as future data centers shift toward quantum and chiplet-based modular architectures, THz wireless links provide a flexible mechanism for interconnecting, testing, and reconfiguring these modules. Finally, numerical analysis is presented on the latency and power regimes of THz versus optical and copper interconnects, identifying the specific distance and throughput domains where THz links can surpass conventional wired solutions.

The electronic absorption line shape of LH2 contains two major bands at 800 nm and 850 nm wavelength regions. Under low light condition, some species of purple bacteria replace LH2 with LH3, a variant form with almost the same structure as the former but with distinctively different spectral features. The major difference between the absorption line shapes of LH2 and LH3 is the shift of the 850 nm band of the former to a new 820 nm region. The microscopic origin of this difference has been subject to some theoretical/computational investigations. However, the genuine molecular level source of such difference is not clearly understood yet. This work reports a comprehensive computational study of LH2 and LH3 complexes so as to clarify different molecular level features of LH2 and LH3 complexes and to construct simple exciton-bath models with a common form. All-atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of both LH2 and LH3 complexes provide detailed molecular level structural differences of BChls in the two complexes, in particular, in their patterns of hydrogen bonding (HB) and torsional angles of the acetyl group. Time-dependent density functional theory calculation of the excitation energies of BChls for structures sampled from the MD simulations, suggests that the observed differences in HB and torsional angles cannot fully account for the experimentally observed spectral shift of LH3. Potential sources that can explain the actual spectral shift of LH3 are discussed, and their magnitudes are assessed through fitting of experimental line shapes.",

Starting from a Poisson photon-counting model for bi-exponential fluorescence decays convolved with a finite instrument response function (IRF) and including additive background, we derive FI for both time-binned TCSPC histograms and programmable time-gated acquisitions. To ensure robustness when nuisance parameters such as IRF width, temporal offset, and background level are uncertain, we compute an effective FI using a Schur-complement marginalization and select hardware-feasible temporal designs by maximizing D-optimal criteria over candidate libraries. Across instrument-agnostic simulations spanning IRF broadening and increasing background fractions, FI-driven temporal designs consistently improve photon efficiency relative to uniform sampling, while nuisance-aware planning yields more stable gains under mismatch than naive optimization. Monte Carlo studies with maximum-likelihood estimation confirm that higher effective FI translates into reduced estimator variance and improved parametric map quality at fixed photon budgets. Finally, we map the same FI core to two practical deployment pathways: adaptive re-binning for TCSPC FLIM and adaptive gate placement/width selection for time-gated FLIM, enabling information-theoretic acquisition without hardware modification.",

In this regard, understanding the effects of donor-acceptor quantum coherence and non-Markovian bath, which become significant at short distances, has significant implications. The present work investigates this issue theoretically by comparing results from a theory of coherent RET (CRET) with a nonequilibrium version of F\\\"{o}rster's RET (FRET) theory, both accounting for non-Markovian bath effects. Even for a model where the donor-acceptor electronic coupling is of transition dipole interaction form, it is shown that the RET rate in general deviates from the inverse sixth power distance dependence as opposed to the prediction of the original FRET. It is shown that the donor-acceptor quantum coherence makes the \\re{distance} dependence steeper than the sixth power although detailed manner of enhancement is sensitive to specific values of parameters. On the other hand, the non-Markovian bath effects make the \\re{distance} dependence more moderate than the sixth power for both CRET and nonueqilibrium FRET because finite time scale of the bath causes the rate to be smaller than the prediction of original FRET. While these effects are \\re{demonstrated clearly} in the population dynamics at sub-picosecond time scales, their contributions to the conventional RET efficiency are relatively minor. This indicates that the actual detection of such effects through conventional RET efficiency measurement requires either high precision or utilization of a donor with fast spontaneous decay rate of excitation.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2410.16005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Metastatic prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is characterized by a high mortality rate and a poor prognosis. In this work, we explore how a clinical oncologist can apply a Stackelberg game-theoretic framework to prolong metastatic prostate cancer survival, or even make it chronic in duration. We utilize a Bayesian optimization approach to identify the optimal adaptive chemotherapeutic treatment policy for a single drug (Abiraterone) to maximize the time before the patient begins to show symptoms. We show that, with precise adaptive optimization of drug delivery, it is possible to significantly prolong the cancer suppression period, potentially converting metastatic prostate cancer from a terminal disease to a chronic disease for most patients, as supported by clinical and analytical evidence. We suggest that clinicians might explore the possibility of implementing a high-level tight control (HLTC) treatment, in which the trigger signals (i.e. biomarker levels) for drug administration and cessation are both high and close together, typically yield the best outcomes, as demonstrated through both computation and theoretical analysis. This simple insight could serve as a valuable guide for improving current adaptive chemotherapy treatments in other hormone-sensitive cancers.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2507.08291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Anomalous diffusion often arises in complex environments where viscoelastic or crowded conditions influence particle motion. In many biological and soft-matter systems, distinct components of the medium exhibit unique viscoelastic responses, resulting in time-dependent changes in the observed diffusion exponents. Here, we develop a theoretical model of two particles, each embedded in a distinct viscoelastic medium, and coupled via a harmonic potential. By formulating and solving a system of coupled fractional Langevin equations (FLEs) with memory exponents $0<\\alpha<\\beta\\leq 1$, we uncover rich transient anomalous diffusion phenomena arising from the interplay of memory kernels and bilinear coupling. Notably, we identify recovery dynamics, where a subdiffusive particle ($\\alpha$) transiently accelerates and eventually regains its intrinsic long-time mobility. This recovery emerges only when memory exponents differ ($\\alpha<\\beta$), whereas identical exponents ($\\alpha=\\beta$) suppress recovery. Our theoretical predictions offer insight into experimentally observed transient anomalous diffusions, such as polymer--protein complexes and cross-linked cytoskeletal networks, highlighting the critical role of memory heterogeneity and mechanical interactions in biological anomalous diffusion.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00599v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The efficacy of cryopreservation is constrained by the difficulty of achieving sufficiently high intracellular concentrations of cryoprotective solutes without inducing osmotic injury or chemical toxicity during loading. This thermodynamic study introduces a new conceptual mechanism for cryoprotectant delivery into cells directly or through vascular perfusion. In this framework, effective cryoprotection could be achieved through the in situ generation of high intracellular concentrations of cryoprotective solutes via pressure-activated disassembly of membrane-permeant supramolecular assemblies composed of cryoprotectant monomers or oligomers. These supramolecules, present initially at low concentrations, are envisioned to enter cells through passive partitioning or endocytosis with minimal osmotic effect, and subsequently transform into a high intracellular concentration of cryoprotectants upon disassembly. We propose that elevated hydrostatic pressure, generated intrinsically during isochoric (constant-volume) freezing or applied externally under isobaric (constant-pressure) conditions, can destabilize supramolecular assemblies whose dissociated state occupies a smaller molar volume than the assembled state. Under isochoric freezing, ice formation within a fixed volume produces a substantial pressure increase as a thermodynamic consequence of phase change, rendering pressure a dependent variable governed by the Helmholtz free energy. Under isobaric conditions, pressure acts as an externally controlled variable through the Gibbs free energy. In both formulations, pressure-activated disassembly decouples membrane transport from cryoprotectant availability and enables synchronized solute generation precisely during cooling or freezing, without pre-loading of osmotically active solutes.",

Here we describe a new variant of the Good-Turing algorithm whose memory requirements scale linearly with the number of structures in the trajectory, making it suitable even for extremely long simulations.

To investigate this discrepancy, we applied a multi-scale computational framework that integrates large-scale sequence analysis of 1000 homologs, coevolutionary interaction mapping, structural community analysis, intrinsic disorder profiling, and adaptive fitness modelling. These analyses converge on a single conclusion: the catalytic core of SHMT forms an exceptionally conserved and tightly coupled structural unit. This region exhibits dense coevolution, strong intramolecular connectivity, minimal disorder, and extremely low mutational tolerance. Peripheral loops and termini, in contrast, are far more flexible. Relative to established folate-pathway antibiotic targets, SHMT active site is even more rigid and evolutionarily constrained. This extreme constraint may limit the emergence of resistance-compatible mutations, providing a plausible explanation for the absence of natural-product inhibitors. Fitness trajectory modelling supports this interpretation, showing that nearly all active-site residues tolerate only rare or neutral substitutions. Together, these findings identify SHMT as a structurally stable and evolutionarily restricted enzyme whose catalytic architecture is unusually protected. This makes SHMT an underexplored yet promising target for the rational design of next-generation antibacterial agents.",

In this study, we propose a novel framework utilizing Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the full nonlinear compressible potential equation in an unbounded (infinite) domain.

We validate this framework by simulating flow over circular and elliptical geometries, comparing our results against traditional finite-domain and linearized solutions.

However, its high melting point and limited room-temperature plasticity pose significant challenges for processing W using additive manufacturing (AM). Cold spray (CS), a solid-state AM process that relies on high-velocity particle impact and plastic deformation, offers a promising route for additive manufacturing of W, yet conventional CS fails to induce sufficient plastic deformation for effective bonding. In this study, we employ atomistic simulations to investigate the effect of ultrasonic perturbation in enhancing plastic deformation during CS of W, with a focus on acoustoplasticity-driven deformation mechanism. We show that ultrasonic perturbation leads to pronounced acoustic softening and promotes transient temperature elevation at the particle-substrate and particle-particle interfaces, thereby enhancing plastic deformation compared to non-ultrasound-assisted CS. Additionally, our results show that the coupled effects of acoustic softening and enhanced transient thermal activation lead to substantial improvements in interfacial bonding across a wide range of impact velocities, particle sizes, and ultrasonic parameters. Finally, we analyze the feasibility of ultrasound-assisted CS for manufacturing heterogeneous interfaces consisting of an equimolar Vanadium (V)-Tungsten (W) coating on a W substrate. Simulations reveal distinct mechanical behavior and dislocation densities compared to the homogeneous W on W CS configurations. Overall, this work highlights the potential of ultrasound-assisted cold spray as an effective strategy for manufacturing uniform coatings and engineered alloys, thereby addressing critical limitations in the additive manufacturing of refractory metals.",

However, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of BMH systems are often limited by computation, communication, and memory costs. We recently proposed the random batch sum-of-Gaussians (RBSOG) method, which accelerates Coulomb calculations by using a sum-of-Gaussians (SOG) decomposition to split the potential into short- and long-range parts and by applying importance sampling in Fourier space for the long-range part. In this work, we extend the RBSOG to BMH systems and incorporate a random batch list (RBL) scheme to further accelerate the short-range part, yielding a unified framework for efficient simulations with the BMH potential. The combination of the SOG decomposition and the RBL enables an efficient and scalable treatment of both long- and short-range interactions in BMH system, particularly the RBL well handles the medium-range exponential repulsion and dispersion by the random batch neighbor list.

We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material approximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural network-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material discontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics.

The ensemble of uniform measures {mu_N} therefore admits no weak limit, implying an asymptotic loss of ergodicity. Monte Carlo simulations up to N <= 10^6 confirm this decay and the absence of a stationary success probability.

The excited state manifold of carotenoids is not yet fully characterised, however, and includes several dark electronic states that remain elusive. Using femtosecond stimulated resonance Raman spectroscopy, where the vibrational contributions of each excited state can be observed selectively as a function of the Raman excitation, we reveal the nature and symmetry of no less than four different dark states. These results end long-standing controversies in carotenoid research, shining new light on the photophysics of these essential molecules and establishing a spectroscopic framework for characterising their multiple roles.",

To address this challenge, we developed MORE-ML, a computational framework that integrates quantum-mechanical (QM) property data of e-nose molecular building blocks with machine learning (ML) methods to predict sensing-relevant properties. Within this framework, we expanded our previous dataset, MORE-Q, to MORE-QX by sampling a larger conformational space of interactions between BOV molecules and mucin-derived receptors. This dataset provides extensive electronic binding features (BFs) computed upon BOV adsorption. Analysis of MORE-QX property space revealed weak correlations between QM properties of building blocks and resulting BFs. Leveraging this observation, we defined electronic descriptors of building blocks as inputs for tree-based ML models to predict BFs. Benchmarking showed CatBoost models outperform alternatives, especially in transferability to unseen compounds. Explainable AI methods further highlighted which QM properties most influence BF predictions. Collectively, MORE-ML combines QM insights with ML to provide mechanistic understanding and rational design principles for molecular receptors in BOV sensing. This approach establishes a foundation for advancing artificial sensing materials capable of analyzing complex odor mixtures, bridging the gap between molecular-level computations and practical e-nose applications.",

The framework combines: (i) a thermo-mechanical weld process model, and (ii) a coupled deformation-diffusion-fracture phase field-based model that accounts for plasticity and hydrogen trapping, considering multiple trap types, with stationary and evolving trap densities. This enables capturing, for the first time, the interplay between residual stresses, trap creation, hydrogen transport, and fracture. The computational framework is particularised and applied to the study of weld integrity in X80 pipeline steel. The focus is on girth welds, as they are more complex due to their multi-pass nature. The weld process model enables identifying the dimensions and characteristics of the three weld regions: base metal, heat-affected zone, and weld metal, and these are treated distinctively. This is followed by virtual fracture experiments, which reveal a very good agreement with laboratory studies. Then, weld pipeline integrity is assessed, estimating critical failure pressures for a wide range of scenarios. Of particular interest is to assess the structural integrity implications of welding defects present in existing natural gas pipelines under consideration for hydrogen transport: pores, lack of penetration, imperfections, lack of fusion, root contraction, and undercutting. The results obtained in hydrogen-containing environments reveal an important role of the weld microstructure and the detrimental effect of weld defects that are likely to be present in existing natural gas pipelines, as they are considered safe in gas pipeline standards.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2601.00576v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Light harvesting 2 (LH2) complex is a primary component of the photosynthetic unit of purple bacteria that is responsible for harvesting and relaying excitons. The electronic absorption line shape of LH2 contains two major bands at 800 nm and 850 nm wavelength regions. Under low light condition, some species of purple bacteria replace LH2 with LH3, a variant form with almost the same structure as the former but with distinctively different spectral features. The major difference between the absorption line shapes of LH2 and LH3 is the shift of the 850 nm band of the former to a new 820 nm region. The microscopic origin of this difference has been subject to some theoretical/computational investigations. However, the genuine molecular level source of such difference is not clearly understood yet. This work reports a comprehensive computational study of LH2 and LH3 complexes so as to clarify different molecular level features of LH2 and LH3 complexes and to construct simple exciton-bath models with a common form. All-atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of both LH2 and LH3 complexes provide detailed molecular level structural differences of BChls in the two complexes, in particular, in their patterns of hydrogen bonding (HB) and torsional angles of the acetyl group. Time-dependent density functional theory calculation of the excitation energies of BChls for structures sampled from the MD simulations, suggests that the observed differences in HB and torsional angles cannot fully account for the experimentally observed spectral shift of LH3. Potential sources that can explain the actual spectral shift of LH3 are discussed, and their magnitudes are assessed through fitting of experimental line shapes.",

In this regard, understanding the effects of donor-acceptor quantum coherence and non-Markovian bath, which become significant at short distances, has significant implications. The present work investigates this issue theoretically by comparing results from a theory of coherent RET (CRET) with a nonequilibrium version of F\\\"{o}rster's RET (FRET) theory, both accounting for non-Markovian bath effects. Even for a model where the donor-acceptor electronic coupling is of transition dipole interaction form, it is shown that the RET rate in general deviates from the inverse sixth power distance dependence as opposed to the prediction of the original FRET. It is shown that the donor-acceptor quantum coherence makes the \\re{distance} dependence steeper than the sixth power although detailed manner of enhancement is sensitive to specific values of parameters. On the other hand, the non-Markovian bath effects make the \\re{distance} dependence more moderate than the sixth power for both CRET and nonueqilibrium FRET because finite time scale of the bath causes the rate to be smaller than the prediction of original FRET. While these effects are \\re{demonstrated clearly} in the population dynamics at sub-picosecond time scales, their contributions to the conventional RET efficiency are relatively minor. This indicates that the actual detection of such effects through conventional RET efficiency measurement requires either high precision or utilization of a donor with fast spontaneous decay rate of excitation.",

Accurate excited-state energetics are essential for interpreting spectroscopy and chemical reactivity, but standard electronic structure methods are either too computationally expensive for larger systems or lose reliability in the presence of strong electron correlation. MS-iQCC addresses this challenge by simultaneously optimizing multiple electronic states in a single, state-averaged procedure that treats ground and excited states on equal footing. This removes the energetic bias that is introduced when excited states are computed one at a time and constrained to remain orthogonal to previously optimized states. The approach supports multireference electronic structure by allowing multideterminantal initial guesses and by adaptively building a compact exponential ansatz from a pool of qubit excitation generators. We apply MS-iQCC to H$_4$, H$_2$O, N$_2$, and C$_2$, including strongly correlated geometries, and observe robust convergence of all targeted state energies to chemically meaningful accuracy across their potential energy surfaces.",

Hot-charge emission spectroscopy (HotES) probes ELA by injecting ballistic carriers across a tunneling oxide. Yet, the technique inherently convolutes the molecular response with a strong, energy-dependent tunneling background, complicating the isolation of the true ELA. We introduce synchronous differential HotES (sd-HotES), defined as the ratio of the differential conductance of the hot-charge and tunneling channels of the HotES. Physical modeling and numerical simulations validate that this ratio directly reconstructs the intrinsic molecular charge transmission, enabling the threshold-free and probe-bias-insensitive extraction of ELA. By effectively eliminating the masking tunneling background, sd-HotES substantially boosts detection sensitivity; weak spectral features previously hidden in conventional HotES become clearly resolvable, as demonstrated in lock-in simulations including realistic noise. This study establishes the fundamental operating principles of sd-HotES and highlights it as a powerful, broadly applicable strategy for accessing buried interface properties for the study of molecular and hybrid devices.",

To investigate this discrepancy, we applied a multi-scale computational framework that integrates large-scale sequence analysis of 1000 homologs, coevolutionary interaction mapping, structural community analysis, intrinsic disorder profiling, and adaptive fitness modelling. These analyses converge on a single conclusion: the catalytic core of SHMT forms an exceptionally conserved and tightly coupled structural unit. This region exhibits dense coevolution, strong intramolecular connectivity, minimal disorder, and extremely low mutational tolerance. Peripheral loops and termini, in contrast, are far more flexible. Relative to established folate-pathway antibiotic targets, SHMT active site is even more rigid and evolutionarily constrained. This extreme constraint may limit the emergence of resistance-compatible mutations, providing a plausible explanation for the absence of natural-product inhibitors. Fitness trajectory modelling supports this interpretation, showing that nearly all active-site residues tolerate only rare or neutral substitutions. Together, these findings identify SHMT as a structurally stable and evolutionarily restricted enzyme whose catalytic architecture is unusually protected. This makes SHMT an underexplored yet promising target for the rational design of next-generation antibacterial agents.",

Although prior work has revealed that network structure and multiplex interactions can promote cooperation, most theory assumes that individuals play similar dilemma games in all social contexts. However, real-world agents may participate in a diversity of interactions, not all of which present dilemmas. We develop an evolutionary game model on multilayer networks in which one layer supports the prisoner's dilemma game, while the other follows constant-selection dynamics, representing biased but non-dilemmatic competition, akin to opinion or fad spreading. Our theoretical analysis reveals that coupling a social dilemma layer to a non-dilemmatic constant-selection layer robustly enhances cooperation in many cases, across different multilayer networks, updating rules, and payoff schemes. These findings suggest that embedding individuals within diverse networked settings -- even those unrelated to direct social dilemmas -- can be a principled approach to engineering cooperation in socio-ecological and organizational systems.",

Populations evolve over time according to a piecewise linear system of ordinary differential equations subject to a non-negativity constraint resulting in discrete time extinction and revival events. The dynamics are generated by a random elliptic community matrix with tunable correlation strength. We show that, independent of the correlation strength, solutions of the system are confined to subsets of the phase space that can be cast as time-varying Gardner volumes from the theory of learning in neural networks. These volumes decrease with the diversity (i.e. the fraction of extant species) and become exponentially small in the long-time limit. Using standard results from random matrix theory, the changing diversity is then linked to a sequence of contractions and expansions in the spectrum of the community matrix over time, resulting in a sequence of May-type stability problems determining whether the total population evolves toward complete extinction or unbounded growth. In the case of unbounded growth, we show the model allows for a particularly simple nonlinear extension in which the solutions instead evolve towards a new attractor.",

Steady-state absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, and time-resolved fluorescence measurements reveal distinct binding behaviours depending on the host architecture. While \u03b2CD, HP\u03b2CD and the dimers predominantly form 1:1 complexes with 1HOPy, \u03b3CD displays cooperative binding, giving rise to both 1:1 and 2:2 host\u2013guest assemblies. In the polymers 2 CDs tend to encapsulate the 1HOPy guest. Spectroscopic signatures further indicate that, under buffered conditions, partial formation of the enolate form of 1HOPy may contribute to enhanced stabilization in one dimer. Binding constants differ even by 2 orders of magnitude with HP\u03b2CD displaying the highest affinity followed by one dimer.\nTo rationalize these observations at the molecular level, extensive molecular dynamics simulations combined with thermodynamic integration (TI) were performed. Computational models were designed to reflect the experimentally relevant stoichiometries while also probing alternative binding scenarios to explain deviations from experimental fits. Structural analyses based on RMSD, minimum host\u2013guest distances, hydrogen-bond patterns, and clustering reveal that \u03b2CD dimers remain relatively flexible and poorly compacted upon guest binding, whereas \u03b3CD undergoes pronounced guest-induced dimer stabilization. In particular, inclusion of two 1HOPy molecules drives the compaction of the otherwise labile \u03b3CD dimer, leading to a rigid and cooperative supramolecular assembly.\nBinding free energies computed by TI reproduce the experimental hierarchy of affinities and highlight that interaction energies alone do not predict thermodynamic stability. For \u03b2CD systems, strong local host\u2013guest interactions translate only into moderate binding free energies, whereas \u03b3CD exhibits a marked amplification of affinity arising from cooperative host\u2013host reorganization. Comparison between calculated and experimental free energies shows overall agreement, while also delineating specific deviations attributable to chemical effects not explicitly captured by the classical force-field description.\nOverall, this study demonstrates that 1HOPy not only acts as a passive guest but can actively stabilize supramolecular architectures, particularly in \u03b3CD systems. These findings provide molecular-level insight into cyclodextrin\u2013PAH metabolite recognition and support the rational design of cyclodextrin-based platforms for the detection and sensing of environmental biomarkers.",

    "summary": "Comprehensive analyses of multiple biological components including nucleic acids, proteins, metabolites, and lipids (i.e., \u201cmultiomics\u201d) provide unique insights into complex biological processes. Combining insights from these components through multiomics data integration enhances the depth and nuance of biological understanding available from these measurements. Among methods that integrate data across different technologies (e.g. mass spectrometry, sequencing), those that link components based on biological prior knowledge\u2014pathway analyses\u2014represent the most direct way of translating molecular-level observations into meaningful biological insights. However, significant barriers exist that prevent full utilization of metabolomics and especially lipidomics data in pathway integration. Challenges include the fast turnover and complex interactions of small molecules compared to biological macromolecules, low metabolite annotation rates, isomerism among lipids, and a lack of lipid representation in existing pathway knowledge bases. While these issues stem from a variety of causes, improvements to multiomics pathway integration including better incorporation of lipids into pathway knowledge bases and increased adoption of artificial intelligence approaches can greatly enhance the utility of small molecule -omics data, particularly for lipidomics. Here we describe the current landscape of multiomics integration tools with an emphasis on support for metabolomics and lipidomics data, we highlight their capabilities and gaps with tangible examples using real multiomics data, and provide our perspective on how these approaches can be improved to better support generation of useful biological insights from complex multiomics data",

Yet, its clinical translation can be limited by potential immunogenicity. To accelerate the development of improved thrombolytics, a critical step is identifying the most suitable molecular template. Therefore, we performed a comparative analysis of biochemical and immunological properties of three engineered low-immunogenic variants (SAK SY155, SAK THR174, and SAK STAR FRIDA) and two wild-types (SAK STAR and SAK 42D), using a newly established panel of assays. All variants retained potent thrombolytic activity, with SAK SY155 displaying the highest catalytic efficiency and fibrin-clot permeability. However, this advantage did not fully translate into improved clot reduction under flow conditions. Comprehensive immunological profiling, including monocyte activation, T lymphocyte proliferation, dendritic cell maturation, and mouse immunization models, revealed no strong immunogenic response in any tested variant. Overall, low-immunogenic SAK SY155 and its background wild-type SAK STAR emerged as the most promising templates for rational engineering of next-generation thrombolytics.",

    "summary": "Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is secreted from the intestinal L cells in a glucose-dependent manner. However, the mechanism underlying how glucose stimulates the secretion remains unclear. Here, we found that glucose at postprandial concentrations near the Km of GK for glucose (~10 mM), as well as nonmetabolizable glucose analogs, triggers GLP-1 secretion by intestinal L cells through directly binding to glucokinase (GK), without increasing intracellular ATP levels. We also show that in postprandially high glucose, glucose-bound GK interacts and inhibits KATP, as assessed by immunoprecipitation and FRET-FLIM analyses, as well as patch clamping. In addition, we have utilized GK mutants identified in diabetics, demonstrating that those mutants defective in binding to glucose impair GLP-1 secretion in however high glucose, whereas mutants constitutively bound to glucose with defects in catalysis, promote GLP-1 secretion even in low glucose. Furthermore, the KATP mutant unable to bind to GK blocks GLP-1 secretion in high glucose. We have also provided evidence showing that sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1) plays an important role in the basal secretion of GLP-1, but not in high glucose. We have thus revealed that glucose the molecule itself and GK act as a ligand and the receptor, respectively, to induce GLP-1 secretion in response to high glucose, providing new therapeutic avenues targeting metabolic diseases.",

We present a dense slowness-shift imaging method that estimates local speed-of-sound changes from ultrasound B-mode images using optical flow. This single-transducer, image-based approach enables mapping of spatial temperature change without requiring additional hardware. Cryoablation experiments in a tissue-mimicking phantom and ex vivo turkey breast demonstrated that slowness deviation increases with decreasing temperature. In the phantom, the dependence was linear (a = -20.70 s{middle dot}m-1C{degrees}-1), while in turkey breast it presented an exponential relationship (t = 34.04xexp(0.075(-{Delta}T)) s{middle dot}m-1C{degrees}-1). The algorithm detected sub-degree temperature variations and accurately tracked cooling down to -39.4 {+/-} 5.6 {degrees}C. This work demonstrates the feasibility of ultrasound-based, noninvasive temperature monitoring during cryoablation, providing a scalable, real-time alternative to existing invasive or high-cost thermal assessment techniques.",

    "title": "Decoupled Representation Learning Improves Generalization in CRISPR Off-Target Prediction",
    "summary": "Computational prediction of CRISPR-Cas9 off-target activity is a critical step toward the safe and scalable design of guide RNAs. Most existing deep learning models are trained on large proxy datasets derived from high-throughput assays; however, their performance often degrades when evaluated on experimentally validated off-target sites. This limitation raises concerns about the generalization ability of proxy-trained models and highlights the need for architectures that better transfer to biologically relevant benchmarks such as TrueOT. We propose a two-stage deep learning framework that decouples sequence representation learning from off-target classification. In the first stage, guide RNA sequences are encoded using pretrained transformer-based embeddings learned from large genomic corpora. In the second stage, a hybrid neural network integrates these embeddings with mismatch-level and sequence-pair features to predict off-target activity. Models are trained exclusively on a proxy dataset and evaluated under strict external validation on the TrueOT benchmark. Our results show that incorporating pretrained sequence embeddings substantially improves generalization performance. The full two-stage model achieves consistent improvements in ROC-AUC and PR-AUC on TrueOT, relative to proxy-only baselines, across repeated runs. We demonstrate a consistent generalization effect under distribution shift, robust to training noise, seeds, and evaluation variance. These findings provide empirical evidence that representation transfer plays a critical role in bridging the gap between proxy assay data and experimentally validated off-target behavior.",

    "title": "The Influence of Ligands on AlphaFold3 Prediction of Cryptic Pockets",
    "summary": "Cryptic pockets are binding sites that are formed or exposed upon a conformational change. They represent an important class of potentially druggable binding sites. Reliably predicting cryptic pockets capable of binding ligands, however, remains a challenge. Herein we examine the use of AlphaFold 3 (AF3) for generating realistic conformational ensembles that include known cryptic pockets. We find that AF3 is generally able to reproduce the scale of conformational change required for cryptic site formation. When given a cryptic-site ligand for the protein, AF3 predominantly predicts conformations competent to bind the ligand in the cryptic site; without the ligand, conformations lacking the cryptic pocket generally dominate. While the results may reflect a bias toward memorized structural priors, the level of detrimental memorization appears to be limited. We also show that the choice of the ligand can significantly impact the predictions, and that AF3 is able to produce models with the ligand correctly positioned. Variability in ligand position, however, suggests that generating ensembles of co-folded predictions is critical to enhancing the likelihood of obtaining a correct binding mode. Overall, AF3-generated protein-ligand structural ensembles have potential utility in cryptic-site drug discovery, and they can reveal ligands likely to bind to those sites.",

    "summary": "Network medicine leverages large biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) to model disease mechanisms and identify therapeutic opportunities. However, most deep learning approaches that use KGs in biomedicine remain task-specific, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse applications within a unified framework. Here, we introduce NetMedGPT, a transformer-based foundation model trained on a large-scale biomedical KG using masked token prediction. By learning contextualized representations of biomedical nodes, NetMedGPT enables unified, zero-shot inference across different drug discovery tasks. Specifically, in five tasks, i.e., predicting the association of drugs with indications, targets, adverse drug reactions, contraindications, and off-label uses, NetMedGPT consistently outperforms all specialized baselines, achieving area under the precision-recall curve gains of between 2.2% and 26%. When evaluated on independent external datasets, NetMedGPT outperformed baseline on an expert-curated clinical indications set and also preferentially prioritized clinically relevant drug-disease pairs in ClinicalTrials.gov. NetMedGPT's generative capability further supports the construction of mechanistically plausible subnetworks offering biological insights. NetMedGPT provides a unified foundation model for network medicine that supports scalable hypothesis generation and provides potential to accelerate drug repurposing. We further provided an interactive interface (https://prototypes.cosy.bio/chatnetmedgpt/) that allows users to obtain model inferences through natural-language queries.",

    "summary": "Evolutionary pressure on microbial communities propagating under extreme environmental conditions often results in unique structural adaptations to promote cell survival. Here, we report an investigation of AbpX, a biomatrix protein identified in cultures of the hyperthermophilic archaeon Pyrodictium abyssi. Under ex vivo and in vitro conditions, AbpX assembles into a para-crystalline lattice composed of semiflexible fibrils. CryoEM analysis of recombinant AbpX fibrils reveals that the precursor protein polymerizes through donor strand complementation (DSC), a process previously reported for chaperone-usher fimbriae in Gram-negative bacteria. Unlike the latter DSC protein polymers, AbpX undergoes chaperone-free polymerization in the presence of calcium ions, which are sequestered at the donor strand-acceptor groove interface between protomers in the fibril. Using a combination of cryoEM and crystallographic structural information, an atomic model is proposed for the AbpX lattice that provides insight into its potential role in biofilm formation. These findings suggest that calcium ion coordination triggers fibril assembly and pre-organizes the fibrils for incorporation into the protein lattice. Bioinformatic analysis indicates that AbpX exemplifies a distinct and broadly distributed clade of calcium ion responsive biomatrix proteins within the TasA superfamily that can be fabricated into hydrogel biomaterials in vitro under environmentally benign conditions.",

    "title": "Polymer Concentration Induced Self-assembly of Block Copolymers in Ionic Liquid Smart Inks",
    "summary": "Assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) with epoxy is useful to enhance the mechanical toughness of 3D-printable epoxy inks. Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) like 1-Ethyl-3-Methylimidazolium dicyanamide ([EMIM][DCA]) have enhanced the self-assembly of pure BCP, enabling the formation of a controlled nanostructure. However, the mechanistic details of the morphological transitions of BCP to nanostructures in the presence of ILs remain unresolved. Here, we developed a coarse-grained (CG) model for a certain class of BCPs, namely Pluronic P123 in [EMIM][DCA] ionic liquid, to investigate the underlying mechanism beyond nanostructure transition of BCPs under varying temperature and composition. At various Pluronic compositions (20-60 wt%), P123 self-aggregates into spherical, cylindrical, and lamellar nanostructures, confirmed by visual inspection and quantitative metrics. An increase in the concentration of Pluronic leads to the formation of a more favorable self-interaction, resulting in a more ordered, lamellar-shaped aggregate. We suggest that morphological changes of nanostructure are governed by the balance between entropic and enthalpic factors. In a higher ordered shape (lamellar phase), enthalpic dominates, while in spherical-shaped micelles, both entropic and enthalpic are equivalent. Our CG model of PEO and PPO beads can be used to investigate the BCPs phase separation and will further help to understand the thermodynamics of self-aggregation for other BCPs in IL medium. This study will guide the acceleration of the discovery process for advanced 3D printable materials, including Pluronic P123 or other Pluronic materials.",

Incorporation into PCL films transforms the rapid, minute-scale NO release of the powders into sustained release profiles lasting up to 24 h in biologically relevant media. By selecting the type of porous solid and tuning its loading and particle size within the polymer matrix, the NO dosage and release rate can be modulated.

    "summary": "All solid-state batteries (ASSBs) based on solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are a novel Li-ion battery technology with the potential of enhanced safety, longer lifetimes, and increased energy density when coupled with the Li-metal anode. Li-Argyrodite (Li6PS5Cl) is a promising SSE with high ionic conductivity, produced using cheap and sustainable precursors, and therefore of interest to both academia and industry. Like many other sulfide-based SSEs, it is however unstable against Li-metal. Using ab-initio and machine-learning methods, we simulate three representative Li-metal/Li-Argyrodite interface models to investigate whether the exact surface termination affects the chemical stability and ion transport capability. We present a systematic approach to create low-energy interfaces by screening 28 low Miller-index surface terminations of Li-argyrodite and coupling them with Li-metal. Custom-made machine-learned interatomic potentials trained on ab-initio data enable the simulation of large interface models with over 2000 atoms for 5 ns. We find that all three interfaces decompose into an amorphous solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, consisting of Li3P, Li2S and LiCl, which then crystallizes into an antifluorite phase Li2S{1-x-y}P{x}Cl{y}; {x,y = 0.14-0.15}. A two orders of magnitude decrease in Li-ion flux shows that the crystalline SEI layer is a sluggish ion conductor, similar to Li2S. While all three interfaces form the same crystalline SEI layer, the exact rates of the decomposition and crystallisation depend on the actual surface composition. These atomic-level insights could potentially be used to control the SEI formation in sulphide-based SSEs and others.",

    "title": "Enhancing Interfacial Properties in Aramid Fiber/Epoxy Composites via Hyperbranched Polyimide for Superior Performance",
    "summary": "Aramid fiber (AF) reinforced epoxy resin (EP) composites are widely regarded as promising candidates for fabricating advanced composites. However, the inherently weak interfacial adhesion between AF and EP considerably restricts the overall performance of AF/EP composites. Therefore, the effective interfacial optimization of is crucial for realizing high-performance AF/EP composites. In this work, an amino-terminated hyperbranched polyimide (HBPI) was synthesized via low-temperature solution polycondensation and utilized as a novel AF sizing agent. Thereafter, the AF/EP interfacial interactions were enhanced through the combined effects of chemical bonding between the HBPI sizing agent and EP and physical interactions (hydrogen bonding and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 interactions) between HBPI sizing agent and AF, thereby benefiting stress transfer at the interfacial region. As a result, the 90\u00b0 tensile strength and NOL-ring interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of AF0.04/EP composites (with a 0.04 wt% HBPI sizing concentration) were improved by 38.45% and 14.31%, respectively, compared with the AFunsized/EP specimen. Furthermore, the tensile strength and elongation at break of the impregnated filament increased by 17.86% and 14.73%, respectively. These findings demonstrate that the HBPI sizing agent offers significant potential for enhancing the interfacial performance of AF/EP composites, providing valuable theoretical insights for the development of high-performance composite materials.",

A constant rGO loading (2 wt.%) was introduced via in situ hydrazine reduction of graphene oxide in the presence of TiO2. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated under Xe-lamp irradiation in two model reactions probing oxidative and reductive pathways: phenol degradation and H2 evolution using formic acid as a scavenger. rGO systematically enhanced phenol degradation for all morphologies, with bipy+rGO showing the highest activity. In contrast, H2 evolution was consistently suppressed upon rGO incorporation across all TiO2 samples, although the bipyramidal morphology remained the most active within each series.\nThese results highlight that facet exposure and surface functionalization dictate the beneficial or detrimental role of rGO depending on the targeted photocatalytic pathway.",

Herein, we report an operando Raman characterization that provides high voltage, time, and spatial resolutions, which enables simultaneous analysis of interfacial decomposition mechanism and morphological evolution. Using Na3SbS4 electrolyte (NSS) and its carboxymethyl-cellulose-encapsulated analogue (NSS-CMC) as exemplars, we precisely contrasted the subtle differences in the two-step reduction mechanism of the two electrolytes. In both systems, Na3SbS3 formed as an intermediate, and Na3Sb binary as one major final product; while the CMC coating altered the kinetics of Na3SbS3 formation and consumption, and extended the formation potential of Na3Sb from 1.35 V (seen in NSS) to 0.50 V (vs. Na/Na+). Oxidation of NSS and NSS-CMC both occur near 2.20 V, although CMC coating altered the crystallinity of the oxidative products. Simultaneously, we captured phenomena that are unique to solid-state electrochemical systems such as particle relocation, morphological change, and reversed reactions. We inferred CMC\u2019s dual role as a voltage barrier and a mechanical buffer in suppressing the electro-chemo-mechanical decomposition of NSS electrolyte.

    "summary": "Lead-free potassium-sodium niobate (K0.5Na0.5NbO\u2083, KNN) ceramics represent a promising alternative to replace lead-based piezoelectrics in energy harvesting and actuator applications due to their high Curie temperature and favorable ferroelectric properties. This study investigates the structural, dielectric, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties of pure KNN and multi-element doped compositions: (K0.4Na0.48Bi0.1La0.02)(Nb0.9Ti0.1)O3 (KNN-BiLaTi) and (K0.4Na0.56La0.02Y0.02)(Nb0.9V0.05Sb0.05)O3 (KNN-LaYVSb), synthesized via conventional solid-state methods. Structural analysis (XRD/Rietveld) revealed single-phase orthorhombic perovskite structures (space group Amm2) for all samples, with no detectable secondary phases. XPS, Raman, SEM, and TEM revealed that the dopants tune defect chemistry, suppress surface alkali degradation, and refine the microstructure, especially in dense, low-porosity KNN-LaYVSb, which has pronounced lattice distortion for favorable domain wall motion. Dielectric experiments demonstrated lower orthorhombic\u2013tetragonal transition temperatures and wider, more diffuse phase transitions. However, Curie temperatures remained high, indicating reliable operation over a wide range of temperatures. At optimal poling, KNN-LaYVSb attained the highest piezoelectric coefficient (d\u2083\u2083 = 221 pC/N) and excellent thermal stability up to 275 \u00b0C, retaining over 90% of room-temperature value and over 80% at elevated temperatures near 450 \u00b0C. The improved temperature stability arises from diffuse phase transitions, defect-dipole stabilization, and nanoscale heterogeneity due to multi-element doping. The remnant polarization increased from 3.49 \u00b5C/cm\u00b2 (Pure-KNN) to 25.3 \u00b5C/cm\u00b2 (KNN-LaYVSb) with significantly reduced coercive field (6.10 kV/cm). These findings illustrate that selective multi-element co-doping at A- and B-sites effectively modifies polymorphic phase boundaries near room temperature by improving defect chemistry through controlled vacancy formation and optimizing microstructure. This results in robust, high-performance lead-free piezoceramics for advanced energy harvesting and sensing applications operating across wide temperature ranges.",

    "summary": "Nitrogen heterocycles are integral part of pharmaceuticals, catalysts, and materials, yet most accessible molecular scaffolds remain flat, aromatic rings with limited three-dimensionality. As medicinal chemistry increasingly seeks non-planar, sp3-rich architectures to improve molecular performance and to expand underexplored chemical space, methods that can remodel existing heterocycles into new 3D frameworks are urgently needed. Here we introduce a fundamentally new strategy for ring insertion that uses simple nucleophilic reagents - most notably, Grignard reagents - to introduce one-carbon  into azolium rings. This unprecedented nucleophilic rearrangement converts planar triazolium salts, derived from alkenes, into a previously inaccessible family of saturated, three-dimensional 1,2,4-triazinanes. The method is operationally simple, broadly applicable to cyclic, acyclic, natural, and highly functionalized alkenes, and remarkably tolerant of sensitive groups including esters, amides, sulfonamides, acetals, phosphates, and alkynes. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory computations reveal a unique nitrenium-centered pathway that enables this umpolung reactivity. By transforming readily available olefins into complex, non-planar nitrogen heterocycles in just two steps, this work provides a powerful entry into new heterocyclic space and opens opportunities for late-stage diversification relevant to drug discovery, catalysis, and molecular design.",

    "summary": "In a Perspective article titled \"Mind the Gap!\", Bredas clarifies the distinction between different uses of the term  \"band gap\" in the context of experimentally measured or computationally evaluated energy gaps. In view of the tremendous progress in atomically precise metal nanoclusters where electrochemical and optical energetics are routinely supported by computations to establish structure-function correlations, we explore the relationship between different protocols for measuring and computing band gaps of two distinct organic ligand-protected nanoclusters: [Cu14H10(MBN)3(PPh3)8]+ and Au20(TBBT)16. Through UV/visible spectroscopy and differential pulse voltammetry, we measure optical and electrochemical band gaps in those systems. We then compare these experimental gaps to HOMO-LUMO gaps, fundamental gaps, vertical excitation energies, and Eox - Ered potentials computed using density functional theory (DFT) or time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT). We test functionals with varying degrees of Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange from 0% to 50%, different correlation functionals, basis sets, and (equilibrium and non-equilibrium) continuum solvation models. We find that in both copper and gold nanoclusters, the most important factor affecting the magnitude of the band gap is the % HF exchange, which in the case of the HOMO-LUMO gap can vary by several eV. This sensitivity is partially mitigated when computing the fundamental, optical, and electrochemical gaps. The second most important factor is the proper description of solvation effects. Other factors, such as the nature of the correlation functional, basis set, and geometry relaxation, have a considerably smaller effect on computed band gaps in these systems. Overall, this work provides generalizable guidelines on factors at varied importance for correlating computed and experimental \"band gap\" values.",

The selectivity of this process depends strongly on the nature of substituents in hydrazine.

In both scenarios, the initial products of nucleophilic ring opening undergo in situ Lewis acid-induced cyclization, providing important azaheterocyclic systems in a single synthetic step; further transformations enable access to other valuable products.

    "title": "Non-covalent inter-chain interactions dictate single chain encapsulation behavior of pnictogen chalcogenides within van der Waals nanotubes",
    "summary": "A fully developed understanding of the chemistry that governs interactions in low-dimensional materials is essential to realizing control over their structure, nanoscale morphology, and distinct physical properties. Yet, precisely achieving this in extended solids comprised of highly polarizable main group elements has remained a grand challenge especially in one-dimensional materials that approach the atomic scale. This is owing to the propensity of these heavy main group elements to drive the unusual localization or delocalization behavior of electrons in the system and the formation of competing metastable polytypes due to lone pair effects. In this report, we establish the composition-dependent encapsulation behavior of single chains derived from the low-dimensional Pn2Ch3 pnictogen chalcogenide class (Pn = Sb, Bi; Ch = S, Se, Te) and their strong dependence on the strength of inter-chain non-covalent interactions. Using Sb2S3 and Bi2S3 as model phases, we find that the degree of pnictogen (Pn) bonding is a significant factor in dictating the packing of the constituent quasi-1D chains in the bulk and their growth behavior as single chains upon encapsulation within single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Specifically, chains with weaker inter-chain interactions like Sb2S3 preferentially crystallize under slow-cooled growth parameters that resemble more thermodynamically preferred conditions while chains with stronger inter-chain interactions like Bi2S3 prefer to crystallize and isolate as bulk and only form the elusive encapsulated clustered and crystalline chain domains under rapidly quenched conditions. Systematic Sb/Bi alloying of the precursors revealed the pnictogen-dependence of the chain crystallization where Sb-rich alloys tend to more preferentially crystallize within SWCNTs. In these alloys, Bi preferentially occupies the peripheral three-coordinate site to maximize inter-chain interactions in the bulk, while Sb preferentially occupies the same site when encapsulated within SWCNT and devoid of chains adjacent to it. These results demonstrate that non-covalent bonding concepts in molecular main group systems track in low-dimensional solids that approach the atomic regime when encapsulated within nanotubes, marking a significant step forward in the rational and predictable encapsulation of all-inorganic chains within confined spaces.",

    "summary": "In this review we present eMap 2.0, a web-based application for predicting electron/hole transfer pathways in proteins and protein families based on their structures. The underlying model can be viewed as a coarse-grained version of the Pathways approach by Beratan and Onuchic [Beratan et al. J. Chem. Phys. 1987, 86, 4488]. Similar to the original framework, eMap employs graph-theory algorithms to search for the most efficient electron transfer pathways as shortest paths on a graph representation of the protein. What distinguishes eMap from the original formulation is that the nodes represent electron transfer active sites instead of atoms and only through-space tunneling is considered for each individual electron/hole hop. eMap 2.0 takes one step further by aiming at identifying shared electron transfer pathways in protein sets. From a graph theory standpoint, this is achieved using frequent subgraph mining (FSM) algorithms. Lastly, eMap 2.0 utilizes sequence and structural similarity measures to analyze and cluster the results. Here, we show how this robust method can be utilized to rapidly provide insights regarding conserved electron transfer pathways within protein families and to identify outliers in protein families, in which the conserved electron transfer pathway is blocked either by a mutation or conformational changes.",

    "summary": "This work presents the implementation of the linear response function for 1D periodic systems at coupled cluster with single and double excitations with periodic boundary conditions level (LR-CCSD-PBC) for the calculation of the frequency-dependent electric dipole-electric dipole polarizability tensor, $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}(\\omega)$, with the modified velocity gauge (MVG) formalism. We compare this approach with the length gauge (LG) formalism that we presented in a previous work [APL Comp. Phys. 1, 026107 (2025)] in terms of theoretical analysis and computational results. Calculations on molecular systems with large Dunning basis sets including diffuse functions show a smooth convergence towards the complete basis set limit (CBS) with both formalisms, but LG and MVG converge to different values when CCSD provides an incomplete treatment of electron correlation. With the  small basis sets used in the PBC calculations, the difference between the gauge formalisms increases due to basis set incompleteness. For the PBC calculations on 1D periodic systems, the MVG formalism shows a faster convergence towards the thermodynamic limit with $k$ sampling compared to LG. Furthermore, the MVG formalism provides perfect agreement between PBC and long molecular cluster models. This is not the case for LG due to the so-called missing integer issue. However, a comparison with the molecular data suggests that the LG-PBC results with the small basis set affordable in this work are closer to the CBS results than those with MVG. This work represents a further step forward for the simulation of optical response properties for solid-state materials with systematically improvable quantum mechanical methods.",

    "summary": "The study of artwork is an interesting field that has undergone a major turn the last decades as new scientific analysis methods have been introduced and is becoming a significant part of the investigations. In this study we have employed Raman spectroscopy to analyse the pigments in an old painting of the Roman Emperor Domitian. The painting is of special interest since its creation is historically attributed to Tiziano Vecellio, more known as Titian, but it has recently been found to contain a signature that reads L daVinci. We here perform a rigorous pigment analysis of the painting and signature area to identify and classify the pigments by usage and the potential time of deployment. Microscopic cut outs from selected areas of the painting were analysed in a Raman microscope where 14 different pigments were identified. Out of these, 12 pigments were contemporary with Titian (1488/90-1567) and Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519), one pigment, titanium white, was present during the Middle Ages but came into common use at a later time and one pigment, Prussian blue, is of newer origin. Complimentary X-ray imaging shows that at least one of the areas where Prussian blue was found has likely been altered at a later stage, providing an explanation for the presence of a modern pigment in an old painting. Special emphasis was also applied to resonant and non-resonant Raman response of Prussian green and blue, expressing different ratios of Fe2+ and Fe3+ states, valuable for identification and discrimination of the compounds in pigment identification and in the more recent field of battery research.",

    "summary": "Electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO\u2083RR \u2192 NH\u2083) suffers from poor selectivity and strong competition from hydrogen evolution. Here we show that materials-intrinsic electrostatic reprogramming of colloidal copper nitride (Cu\u2083N) nanocrystals provides a robust lever to bias NO\u2083RR. Two routes are established in a single electrolyte (0.50 M KNO\u2083 + 0.10 M KOH): (i) dilute Na incorporation that preserves the anti-ReO\u2083 (Pm-3m) lattice with small peak shifts, and (ii) Li treatment that amorphizes Cu\u2083N, yielding short-range\u2013ordered Li\u2013Cu\u2013N. Across both families, cyclic voltammetry, LSV/Tafel analysis, and impedance spectroscopy reveal earlier cathodic onset (\u224860\u2013120 mV), reduced charge-transfer resistance (R_ct down to ~16 \u03a9 from ~79 \u03a9 for pristine), and favorable potential-of-zero-charge (PZC) shifts within the operating window.

Electrolyte-cation spike and rinse\u2013swap controls decouple double-layer effects from materials changes: gains on undoped Cu\u2083N vanish after rinsing, whereas Na-modified and Li-amorphous electrodes retain performance. The results delineate two complementary design paradigms lattice-level Na incorporation and controlled Li-induced amorphization that embed a beneficial interfacial field and accelerate NO\u2083RR without reactor or electrolyte redesign.",

    "title": "Crystal Growth, Structures and Optical Bandgaps of Cuprous Rare-Earth Molybdates",
    "summary": "Cuprous-oxide semiconductors have been growing in research interest because of their promising optical and catalytic properties for solar energy conversion. While much recent research has focused on binary and ternary cuprous oxides, the more structurally complex quaternary and higher systems remain significantly less explored. Crystal growth in the cuprous rare-earth (RE) molybdate system has been investigated using high temperature and arc-melting synthesis techniques. Prior studies show the formation of two closely related compounds in these systems, occurring as either Cu6RE4(MoO4)9 (Space group: R3c, No. 161; exclusive for RE = La) or CuRE(MoO4)2 (Space group: Pbca, No. 61; for R = Nd and heavier REs). By contrast, our new synthetic investigations for RE = Ce and La demonstrate the crystallization of both structure types, i.e., as red-colored crystals of Cu6RE4(MoO4)9 (RE = La(1) or Ce(2)) and as yellow-colored crystals of CuRE(MoO4)2 (RE = La(3) or Ce(4)), as obtained by slow cooling from 950 oC and from arc-melting techniques, respectively. Both structures similarly consist of [MoO4]2- tetrahedra bridged either by highly-distorted CuO4 tetrahedra and CeO9 tricapped trigonal prisms in 1 and 2 or by T-shaped CuO3 and CeO8 square antiprisms in 3 and 4. Optical UV-Vis diffuse reflectance measurements on powders of CuRE(MoO4)2 for RE = La, Ce, Sm, Eu, and Yb show relatively larger direct bandgaps in the range of 2.36 to 2.47 eV, while the crystals of Cu6RE4(MoO4)9 for RE = La and Ce yield smaller indirect bandgaps of about 1.89 to 2.05 eV. Electronic structure calculations show bandgaps which stem predominantly from electronic transitions between the filled 3d10-based orbitals of the Cu(I) cations and the empty d-based orbitals of the Mo(VI) cations. Thus, the RE cations are found to have an indirect effect on the optical bandgaps via changes in the local coordination environments of each of these cations. The change in crystal structure, such as from Cu6Ce4(MoO4)9 to CuCe(MoO4)2, has a dramatically larger effect of decreasing the bandgap by ~0.4 to 0.5 eV as compared to only changing the RE cation within the same structure type. In summary, new synthetic investigation of the quaternary cuprous molybdates has elucidated the impact of RE cations on their crystal structures, compositions, and visible-light bandgaps, with the underlying relationships revealed via electronic structure calculations.",

Combined with differently sized complete active space approaches (CASSCF), this method enables a decomposition of the magnetic coupling constant J into its underlying physical contributions. Herein, we extend the VIEH framework to complexes with multiple magnetic coupling pathways. This approach is showcased with a homologous series of [M2(\u03bc\u2212O)(NH3)n]2+ complexes including Cu(II), Ni(II), and Fe(II). Typically, antiferromagnetic coupling progressively weakens from copper to nickel and iron. We demonstrate that this weakening arises primarily from an increase in the ferromagnetic coupling contribution across this series.",

While a role for ATG18/WIPI4 in targeting ATG2A to the IM is well established, how ATG2A is recruited to the ER remains unclear. In this study, we found that MOSPD3, an atypical VAP family protein, acts an adaptor that recruits ATG2A to the ER. MOSPD3 colocalizes with ATG2A and is specifically enriched at ER sites juxtaposed with the IM during autophagosome formation. Recruitment is mediated by direct interactions between the FFNT (two phenylalanines in a neutral tract) motif in the N-terminal region (NT) of ATG2A and the major sperm protein (MSP) domain of MOSPD3. Co-expression of MOSPD3 with ATG2A-NT, but not a MOSPD3-binding-defective mutant ATG2A-NT-T362A, markedly rescued the autophagic defect caused by ATG2A/B double knockout (DKO). MOSPD3 depletion abolishes ATG2A recruitment to the ER and impedes autophagic flux. Together, this study demonstrates that MOSPD3 functions as an ER adaptor for ATG2A in autophagy.",

There are currently no clinically approved therapeutics or vaccines specifically for NiV. A major hurdle in the drug development pipeline is the high mutation rate of RNA viruses, which allows them to rapidly evolve resistance against site-specific inhibitors. This research project utilizes a multi-layered computational strategy to identify a small-molecule inhibitor capable of targeting the viral polymerase while maintaining efficacy against the predicted high-probability W730A resistance mutation. Through a first-principles assessment of the viral polymerase structure (PDB: 9KNZ), I established a design constraint called Allosteric Independence. This requires any lead candidate to bind in a pocket that is geometrically distinct from the mutation site W730, thereby preventing steric or electronic disruption upon mutation. After screening a library of 50 high-potential candidates using a rigid-receptor docking protocol, I identified BMS-986205 (Linrodostat), an investigational IDO1 inhibitor, as a superior lead. BMS-986205 demonstrated a binding affinity of -7.17 kcal/mol against the wild-type polymerase and a paradoxical increase to -7.29 kcal/mol against the W730A mutant. Geometric analysis confirmed a physical separation of 6.28 \u00c5 from the mutation site. Given its current status in global Phase 3 clinical trials for oncology, BMS-986205 is a primary candidate for rapid drug repurposing to secure India\u2019s population against future outbreaks.",

    "title": "MINT32: A Minimum-Image INT32 Coordinate Representation for Fast and Accurate Molecular Dynamics on GPUs",
    "summary": "Molecular dynamics simulations on GPUs have historically required a trade-off between performance and numerical precision. Mixed-precision approaches, such as AMBER SPFP and OpenMM, accumulate forces in high precision while representing coordinates in single precision (FP32). This design introduces a fundamental \u201cnoise floor\u201d: quantization error in FP32 coordinates injects artificial heat into the system, degrading long-term stability and distorting kinetic properties.\n\nWe introduce MINT32, a coordinate representation that maps the simulation box onto a 32-bit integer grid. MINT32 achieves a spatial resolution of approximately 0.01 fm, roughly 300 times finer than FP32, without the memory bandwidth penalties associated with 64-bit integer arithmetic. In addition, MINT32 offers algorithmic elegance through self-wrapping, whereby periodic boundary conditions are enforced via exact integer overflow, eliminating branch divergence entirely.\n\nBenchmark results demonstrate that MINT32 reduces energy drift in microcanonical (NVE) simulations by nearly an order of magnitude (7--10x), delivering double-precision-level stability for challenging PME water systems. When paired with single-precision force evaluations, MINT32 outperforms conventional mixed-precision models, indicating that coordinate precision is the dominant factor governing simulation stability in the systems examined. The fixed-point grid further enables constraint solvers (SHAKE) to converge to tolerances of 10A, effectively eliminating constraint instabilities. Our implementation achieves approximately 85\\% of production throughput on consumer-grade GPUs, serving as a conceptual foundation for future molecular dynamics (MD) engines.\n\nThe primary objective of this study is to identify an optimal coordinate representation for next-generation MD software. To this end, we present a prototype framework designed to isolate and evaluate the numerical behavior of coordinate representations in molecular dynamics, with a modified version of the AMBER simulation package serving solely as a testbed.",

    "summary": "Selective synthetic routes to prepare boronic esters are highly desirable as they are valuable intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional materials. In this paper, we report a new approach to generate boronic esters through the ring-opening hydroboration of benzylidene cyclobutanes catalysed by magnesium(II) complexes. For the first time, products were accessed through the selective hydroboration of a single C\u2013C sigma-bond of the cyclobutane ring with complete chemoselectivity and high E:Z selectivities (99:1 to 3:1) across a wide range of substrates. The mechanism is proposed to proceed through the hydromagnesiation of the benzylidene cyclobutane, ring-opening by beta-alkyl migration, and subsequent Mg-to-B metathesis. Probe experiments, 11B NMR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations suggest that boronate complexes play a role in catalytic turnover, and that ring-closed hydroborated species form as off-cycle intermediates. The new process represents an important example in which a sustainable and inexpensive magnesium catalyst performs in an entirely complementary manner to transition metal systems.",

    "title": "The growing role of open source software in molecular modeling",
    "summary": "The increasing importance and predictive power of modern molecular modeling, driven by physics- and machine learning-based methods, necessitates a new collaborative architecture to replace the isolated, traditional model of software development. The traditional approach often led to redundant engineering effort, high costs, and opaque systems that limit reproducibility, independent scrutiny, and scientific independence.  \n\nThis perspective advocates for permissively licensed open source software as a scientific and economic multiplier by reducing the duplication of effort, enabling scientific validation of modeling tools, and frictionless experimentation with new ideas. Coordinated, multi-project consortia, such as Open Force Field, Open Free Energy, OpenFold, and OpenADMET have formed to collaboratively build shared computational infrastructure and release all methods under permissive licenses. The success of these large-scale efforts requires organizational structures that extend beyond code. The Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF), a US nonprofit, serves as a domain-specific institutional home and fiscal sponsor. By providing governance, administrative infrastructure, and dedicated research software engineers, OMSF aligns incentives across academic and industrial stakeholders. This framework enables a synergistic ecosystem where projects interoperate to accelerate innovation, eliminate duplication, and ensure long-term software sustainability, thereby creating durable foundations that elevate the entire molecular modeling community.",

    "title": "COLVARS-Driven Reactive Molecular Dynamics of Vitrimer Polymerization and Thermomechanical Property Analysis",
    "summary": "Vitrimers are the new class of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) capable of topological rearrangement through dynamic bond exchange, enabling recyclability, self-healing and stress relaxation while maintaining network integrity. The ring opening of epoxides by carboxylic acids is a fundamental epoxy\u2013acid esterification reaction underlying vitrimer network formation, yet its atomistic mechanism remains challenging to simulate as experimental time scales for crosslinking reactions in polymers range from minutes to hours\u2014far beyond the reach of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this work, we employ biased MD using the Collective Variables (COLVARS) module in LAMMPS combined with a reactive ReaxFF potential to promote the ring-opening reaction between Diglycidyl Ether of Bisphenol A (DGEBA) and oxalic acid. Three coupled collective variables were designed to represent epoxide C\u2013O bond cleavage, C(epoxide)\u2013O(acid) bond formation, and proton transfer between acid and epoxide oxygens. This external bias promotes nucleophilic addition of acid-derivedcarboxylate oxygen to the epoxide carbon, resulting in ring opening, followed by proton transfer to yield the \u03b2-hydroxy ester functionality characteristic of vitrimer networks. This method allows simulating cross-linking at realistic, low, temperatures which helps to mimic chemical reactions and avoids unwanted high-temperature side reactions. Since not all accelerated events lead to the desired product, careful selection of initial configurations, molecular orientations, and suitable external bias parameters increases the probability of meaningful simulation results. Furthermore, the stability of the resulting vitrimer was evaluated in the absence of any external bias, and its thermomechanical properties were subsequently analyzed. Results show that the biased MD approach successfully captures the atomistic steps of the esterification reaction and the resulting vitrimer network can be used for accurate prediction of thermomechanical properties.",

    "title": "Synthesis and design of Nickel-Enzyme Ligand Framework for Catalytic Applications",
    "summary": "Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) are a versatile family of porous materials whose modular architecture enables tunable structural diversity and functional versatility. biological MOFs extend this concept by incorporating biomolecules as linkers, introducing biocompatibility and catalytic functionality. \nHere we performed the in situ construction of MOF elements through the direct involvement of enzymes during framework formation. In the absence of enzymes, Ni\u2013MOFs exhibited a typical compact, closed morphology, whereas enzyme-assisted synthesis produced well-defined microsnowflake-like structures. The formation process was rapid, and extended synthesis times did not induce changes in the final morphology. Notably, the enzyme structure played a key role in determining the final architecture; the use of larger enzymes, such as catalase, resulted in the formation of a sandwich-like layered structure. Structural characterization confirmed the formation of a porous material with an average pore size of revealing an average pore diameter ranging from 3 to 6 nm and pore volumes between 0.17 and 0.22 cm\u00b3/g .  Also Ni-ELFs hybrid showed  surface area from 82 of m\u00b2/g  to 139 m\u00b2/g (for Ni-ELF 1). Fluorescent labeling of the protein allowed the localization of the enzyme within the flake-like structures, revealing its preferential distribution at the periphery while leaving the central region accessible, thereby generating a novel hierarchical hybrid porous material.\nTo evaluate catalytic efficiency, ELFs were tested in hydrolytic reactions as esterase/lipase-mimic catalysts. In this context, Ni-based ELFs outperformed free lipases with ELF-1 exhibiting the highest catalytic activity compared to other ELF hybrids.

    "title": "Sequence-controlled Rapid Living Anionic Copolymerization of Polystyrene Derivatives Using a Flow Microreactor",
    "summary": "Copolymers play a vital role in a diverse array of functional materials, where their properties are determined by both their molecular weight and monomer sequence. While precise molecular weight control has been achieved in anionic polymerization reactions, sequence control remains a major challenge, particularly in fast copolymerization reactions that occur on the millisecond (ms) timescale. This limitation arises because conventional in situ spectroscopic analyses fail to capture such rapid kinetics in polar solvents, and existing quenched-flow setups are too complex for practical use. Here, we report a modular flow- microreactor platform that enables both kinetic analysis and sequence control in a fast, living anionic copolymerization reaction. By exploiting ms-scale mixing and quenching, we determined the propagation rate constants for the copolymerization of styrene and tert-butoxystyrene using the Beckingham\u2013Sanoja\u2013Lynd model, providing the first quantitative kinetic insight into such a rapid anionic system. Furthermore, by controlling the monomer feed based on the obtained rate constants, we achieved the synthesis of pseudo-random, gradient, and block copolymers. The pseudo-random copolymer exhibits low glass-transition temperatures and high solubility. This work provides a practical and quantitative approach for analyzing ms-scale polymerization processes and offers a general platform that combines reaction kinetics with polymer-sequence design, thus opening new opportunities for the rational development of functional materials through living anionic polymerization.",

    "title": "Mechanochemical Activation of Spiropyran in PMMA - A Hybrid Quantum Chemical/Atomistic/Coarse-Grained Approach",
    "summary": "Embedding mechanophores into polymer matrices to activate mechanochemical reactions has been extensively employed to realize diverse functional applications. Spiropyran (SP) is a widely used mechanophore that undergoes force-induced isomerization into its activated merocyanine (MC) form, accompanied by a color change. To accurately simulate the SP-MC isomerization process under tension, the present work introduces a large-scale hybrid coarse-grained/atomistic (CG/AA) model in which poly(methyl metacrylate) (PMMA) monomers are represented by in dividual beads, while SP remains fully described at the AA level. We used force field parameters derived from quantum chemical (QC) data, employing the fully atomistic framework previously developed by our group. The underlying CG PMMA force field was reparameterized to match experimental bulk properties and compared with a corresponding atomistic force field. This approach enabled deformation simulations of significantly larger systems than possible with a pure AA force field, at reduced computational cost, thereby providing novel insights into force transduction and mechanophore activation. Furthermore, a parabolic stress distribution was observed along individual PMMA chains, resulting in preferential SP activation near chain centers. Non specific chain scission events occurred far less frequently than SP activations. The developed hybrid model offers a powerful framework for investigating more complex mechanophore doped polymer networks.",

Here, we report a tricyclic scaffold inspired by amitriptyline, modified to incorporate opioid pharmacophore features including a phenolic hydroxyl and a tertiary amine side chain. Computational docking of the ligand against the \u03bc-opioid receptor was performed across nine poses, with interactions analyzed using PLIP [4]. The ligand engages a conserved hydrophobic pocket (ILE 245, VAL 249, ILE 271, TRP 242) and forms hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with polar residues (HIS 3, ASP 96, TYR 97/275).

    "summary": "Electrons have internal structure, you cannot have spin without internal structure, you  cannot have chemistry without spin, computing with out an explicit model for spin has  made chemists\u2019 lives hard.  We present a deterministic framework for computational chemistry that replaces the  probabilistic wave function with a classical electromagnetic model of the electron possessing  internal temporal structure. By recognizing the electron as a half-photon electromagnetic  field configuration oscillating between two temporal poles separated by \u03b40 = \u03bbC /2 \u22481.21  pm, we resolve the classical radiation catastrophe and recover atomic stability without quan-  tum axioms. The electron\u2019s energy resides entirely in the half-photon field oscillation at  frequency \u03c90 = mec2/\u210f, not in electrostatic self-energy of the temporal poles. Angular mo-  mentum conservation (L= \u210f) makes the electron stiff against stretching but compressible  under strong nuclear fields, with compression energy E(\u03b4) = \u210fc/\u03b4 increasing hyperbolically  as \u03b4 < \u03b40. This temporal structure naturally regularizes the nuclear Coulomb potential,  predicting the hydrogen ground state to 0.18% accuracy. The exchange interaction emerges  as magnetic phase-locking between antiparallel electron pairs, calibrated from Cooper pair  coherence lengths in superconductors. This mechanism reproduces the lithium ionization  energy (0.8% error) and derives nitrogen\u2019s sp3 geometry from magnetic dipole packing con-  straints. The Pauli exclusion principle arises from two physical mechanisms: (1) compressed  electrons cannot phase-lock with uncompressed electrons due to frequency mismatch, and  (2) half-photon analytic paths resist spatial overlap. The model offers O(N2) computational  scaling for molecular systems, presenting a classical alternative to density functional theory.",

However, despite its immense potential, the practical substitution of the industrial process remains an elusive target. Despite conducting considerable research for over a century, the primary problem remains the engineering of an efficient and durable electrocatalyst to overcome bottlenecks and convert electrochemical pathways into viable, scalable technologies. Herein, this work transcends a comprehensive review by bridging material breakthroughs with their fundamental mechanistic insights and, through a meticulous analysis of existing experimental studies, reveals how either a small magnetic field or a fictitious magnetic field orchestrates complex catalytic pathways, positioning itself as a cornerstone work to propel the future of magneto-electrochemistry. The material aspects cover not only the already tested materials but also draw a new roadmap for advanced quantum materials that can change the landscape of spin-based catalysis research. Ultimately, the integration of complex materials with dynamic mechanistic understanding, rational cell engineering across diverse applications, and AI- and ML-driven predictive design is poised to revolutionize magnetic-field-assisted catalysis. This unified and adaptive framework for magneto-electrocatalysis not only delineates existing challenges but also illuminates sustainable and scalable pathways toward next-generation energy conversion, environmental remediation, and green chemical manufacturing.",

In this paper, we report a new approach to generate boronic esters through the ring-opening hydroboration of benzylidene cyclobutanes catalysed by magnesium(II) complexes. For the first time, products were accessed through the selective hydroboration of a single C\u2013C sigma-bond of the cyclobutane ring with complete chemoselectivity and high E:Z selectivities (99:1 to 3:1) across a wide range of substrates. The mechanism is proposed to proceed through the hydromagnesiation of the benzylidene cyclobutane, ring-opening by beta-alkyl migration, and subsequent Mg-to-B metathesis. Probe experiments, 11B NMR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations suggest that boronate complexes play a role in catalytic turnover, and that ring-closed hydroborated species form as off-cycle intermediates. The new process represents an important example in which a sustainable and inexpensive magnesium catalyst performs in an entirely complementary manner to transition metal systems.",

    "summary": "The development of molecular post-modification design strategies that enable low-temperature pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) remains an underexplored area. The current state of the art for the pyrolysis of PS demands heating above 400\u00b0C which creates economic barriers to commercial-scale monomer recovery. Here, we demonstrate the post-functionalization of the PS backbone with a labile C-S bond, specifically a trifluoromethylthio group (SCF3), to accelerate the depolymerization of PS at lower temperatures. We first adapted the trifluoromethylthiolation reaction to PS which involved solvent screening and reaction optimization. We observed a significant increase in the depolymerization of PS-SCF3 compared to PS across a wide range of molecular weights and consumer-grade products at 300\u00b0C. Using the Flynn-Ozawa-Wall analysis, the average apparent activation energy for the depolymerization of PS-SCF3 is ~11kJ/mol lower than pristine PS. To benchmark this protocol, we found that the pyrolysis of several consumer-grade PS-SCF3 samples at 300\u00b0C offered greater amounts of styrene compared to pristine consumer-grade PS. This study explores the possibilities of post-functionalizing the backbone of PS to depolymerize PS at faster timescales and lower temperatures to afford greater recovery of styrene, contributing towards a circular economy of plastics.",

    "summary": "Molecular mechanisms governing initiation steps of the assembly of thousands of endogenous multi-protein complexes (EMCs) remain incompletely understood. Here, multiple lines of observations are reported reflecting the biological functions-aligned initiation sequence of hybrid assembly pathways (HAPs) of EMCs. HAPs postulate the creation of cell type-specific intracellular pools of hetero- and homodimers as the first step of chain reactions of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of EMCs\u2019 assemblies. The consensus action sequence of HAPs consists of: a) Initiation on genomic DNA templates of the formation of metastable hetero- and homodimers of EMCs\u2019 protein constituents; b) Release of dimers from DNA templates for delivery to the EMCs assembly compartments; c) Assembly of defined EMCs by sequential on demand addition to preformed dimers serving as attractors of EMC-specific monomers\u2019 ensembles. Chromosome-na\u00efve scaffolds of PPIs contributing to creation of intracellular dimer pools constitute genome-wide networks of binding sites for 716 transcription factors (TFs), 534 of which manifest patterns of significantly enriched expression in 1358 brain regions. The initiators\u2019 loci of HAPs appear to operate within nucleosome-depleted islands of transposable elements (TE) \u2013 derived sequences within transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. Performance of PPI DNA template-guided assembly lines of EMCs is illustrated in two concurrent modes of PPI cascades: TF-TF PPI chains and TF-PPI Hub protein chains. Regardless of the number of DNA-bound TFs initiating the multistep PPI sequences at PPI initiators (ranging from one to 716 TFs), both modes of operations reached the equilibrium at the PPI constituents saturation levels of ~245 proteins for TF-TF PPI and of ~351 proteins for TF-PPI Hub Proteins\u2019 assembly chains. Regardless of TF panels bound at HAP initiators, proteins of PPI-guided ensembles are enriched in either defined sets of neuroanatomical structures (TF-TF PPI path) or among structural-functional constituents of synapses (PPI Hub proteins path). Examples of default operation modes of DNA-template-guided assemblies of hetero- and homodimers of Yamanaka factors, neurogenesis constituents, and principal protein components of postsynaptic density of excitatory and inhibitory synaptogenesis are reported. Altogether, this contribution reports the foundational evidence for further experimental and theoretical explorations of retrotransposon-seeded genome-wide codes for initiators of PPI chain reactions of protein dimerization creating pools of attractors to guide and accelerate the EMC assemblies.",

    "title": "Effect of PEG Chain Length on the Water Solubility of Monodisperse PEG-Appended Molecules",
    "summary": "Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a nonionic and highly water-soluble polymer, and PEGylation is widely used as a versatile chemical strategy to enhance the water solubility of otherwise poorly soluble molecules. The rational design of PEG-appended materials, therefore, requires an estimation of the PEG chain length necessary to achieve the desired level of solubility. Here, we investigated the relationship between the PEG chain length and the water solubility of PEG-appended molecules using a combination of experimental and computational approaches. We focused on monodisperse PEG with a discrete molecular weight, which enables us to identify the relationship between chain length and physicochemical properties, as represented by water solubility. Then, we designed a series of PEG\u2011appended molecules bearing monodisperse PEG chains of varying lengths, and measured their water solubilities experimentally. In parallel, molecular dynamics-based alchemical free\u2011energy calculations yielded thermodynamic trends that reproduced the observed dependence of solubility on PEG chain length. Comparison of experimental and computational results showed that the calculations not only distinguished between water-soluble and insoluble PEG-appended molecules but also captured the solubility trends for moderately soluble species. These findings demonstrate the potential of molecular-dynamics-based free-energy calculations for a priori prediction of the water solubility of PEG-appended molecules.",

Here, we report that the Red box, a fully organic macrocyclic cationic receptor, exhibits high-affinity and selectivity for G4 structures. Biophysical analyses reveal that the Red box binds the c-MYC G4 with nanomolar affinity, stronger than most reported c-MYC ligands. Notably, the Red box displays greater selectivity for c-MYC over duplex DNA compared to the well-characterized porphyrin TMPyP4 and its macrocyclic architecture is essential for this activity, as its acyclic analogue displays negligible G4 stabilization. In cellular assays, treatment with non-cytotoxic concentrations of the Red box selectively downregulated c-MYC expression in HEK293T cells, with minimal effects on c-KIT and hTERT. Furthermore, c-MYC suppression was proportional to its basal expression across several cell lines, supporting a G4-mediated mechanism.",

    "summary": "All-inorganic halide perovskites, especially CsPbBr3 microcrystals, are often considered to be \noptically stable and less defect-prone compared to their organometallic counterparts. \nNevertheless, reports of photoluminescence (PL) blinking in bulk perovskite systems till date \nare restricted to organometallic halide perovskite nano-/microrods, leaving it an open question \nwhether similar intermittency behaviour can be observed in all-inorganic halide perovskites of \ncomparable dimensions. Intriguingly, we witnessed multi-level PL fluctuations (flickering) in \nindividual green-emitting CsPbBr3 microrods. Wide-field PL microscopy reveals that the \nintensity fluctuations are nearly identical along the microrod, owing to charge carrier migration,  \nand waveguide\u2011assisted propagation. Our measurements on single microrod suggests that the \nflickering dynamics is strongly influenced by excitation power, excitation energy, and local \nenvironmental constituents. Under dry argon environment, a sharp reduction in the PL intensity \nis observed, indicating the formation of large number of nonradiative (NR) centers which \nquenches all the photogenerated carriers, suppressing overall emission intensity and PL \nflickering. The exposure of oxygen passivates these NR traps generated under argon, while \nhumidity introduces metastable photoinduced NR traps (\u201cspecial quenchers\u201d) that govern the \nenhanced flickering behaviours. Our findings establish that spatiotemporally correlated \nintermittency is not limited to organometallic perovskites but extends to all-inorganic \nperovskite bulk emitters as well and provides new insights into the role of transient defects and \natmospheric constituents in dictating emission stability.",

The spatio-functional relationship between transcription of rRNA and nucleolar substructures and how this adapts to cellular stress remain incompletely understood. In this study, we resolve the sub nucleolar structures using expansion microscopy to reveal ordered structures of fibrillar center (FC) and dense fibrillar component (DFC) domains as nested shells, which is reorganized upon cellular stress like DNA damage or RNA polymerase I (RNAPI) inhibition. Direct visualization of nascent (5' ETS) and mature (28S) rRNA suggested that rRNA synthesis is the critical regulator of nucleolar size, and organization. Nucleolar reorganization upon stress emerges to be a direct function of nascent rRNA levels. Stress-induced transcription inhibition remodels the sub-nucleolar compartments from a viscoelastic state into solid-like condensates thereby perturbing the nucleolar pH gradient due to the missing rRNA scaffold. We show, that rather than signalling to mediate rDNA repair, nucleolar reorganization naturally arises primarily from reduced rRNA levels and the resultant biophysical restructuring of the nucleolus under cellular stress.",

    "summary": "Unraveling the kinetics of transcriptional regulation is a central challenge in molecular biology. Traditional inference methods based on cell-to-cell mRNA variability are limited because mRNA levels reflect not only transcriptional activity but also post-transcriptional processes. Recent advances in quantifying nascent RNAs across isogenic cells provide a more direct readout of transcriptional dynamics. Here, we present a moments-based theoretical framework that leverages nascent RNA data to infer transcriptional kinetics. We derive closed-form expressions for the first two time-dependent moments of nascent RNA across three canonical transcription models and demonstrate that nascent RNA exhibits distinct transient overshoots and higher Fano factors compared to mature mRNA. Through analysis of synthetic datasets, we show that these features enable more accurate estimation of transcriptional kinetics and allow reliable model selection, distinguishing single from multi-pathway promoter activation with over 75% accuracy even from small sample sizes. We further validated our model selection method using real experimental transcription datasets in yeast and E. coli cells, with nascent RNA demonstrating superior performance in identifying cross-talk pathway regulation. Our framework thus offers a computationally efficient and mechanistically informative approach for decoding transcriptional dynamics, emphasizing the advantages of time-dependent nascent RNA measurements over mature mRNA in capturing the true kinetics of transcriptional regulation.",

    "summary": "Therapeutic peptides combine the advantages of small molecules and antibodies, offering target flexibility and low immunogenicity, yet their successful translation requires careful evaluation of multiple developability properties beyond binding alone. As chemically modified peptides become increasingly common in drug design, no unified platform currently supports systematic property assessment across both canonical sequences and SMILES-based representations. Leveraging the generalizability of large foundational models trained on protein and chemical data, we introduce PeptiVerse, a universal therapeutic peptide property prediction platform. PeptiVerse accepts either amino acid sequences or chemically modified peptide SMILES, delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse property prediction tasks, and provides both a web interface and open-source implementation for rapid, accessible, and scalable peptide developability analysis. By unifying property prediction across representations, PeptiVerse directly supports early-stage peptide therapeutic development campaigns and property-aware generative design workflows.

Its conductive state remains unresolved, leaving questions about gating, Cl- permeation, and modulation by Ca2+, depolarization, and lipids. To investigate the open state, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of TMEM16A bound to the putative open-state blocker 1PBC. After inhibitor removal, the putative, pore-lining helix TM4 developed kinks at two sites: an upper site that opens the pore for Cl- permeation, and a deeper site causing constriction. A conserved hydrophobic network between TM3 and TM4 persisted in most open structures but separated during extreme dilation, allowing lipids to transiently block the pore. Patch-clamp recordings indicated that the intact network promotes activation. Further simulations yielded > 60 Cl- permeation events and a single-channel conductance matching experiments. Additional electrostatic and kinetic modeling indicated that TMEM16As transition from outward-rectification to Ohmic conductance with increasing Ca2+ results from a weak voltage dependence of Ca2+ binding, which act cooperatively to open the pore.",

    "summary": "Although biological membranes exhibit complex and dynamic organization, the mechanistic role of molecular crowding in governing lateral membrane heterogeneity remains poorly characterized experimentally. Here, we provide direct experimental visualization showing that crowding-induced condensation of membrane-anchored macromolecules above the bilayer interface reorganizes membrane dynamics and gives rise to spatially heterogeneous lipid mobility. Both PEGylated lipids and membrane-anchored proteins undergo surface-density-driven condensation on supported lipid bilayers, forming immobile regions that constrain lipid diffusion. Notably, the condensation threshold varies inversely with PEG chain length and surface density, defining a quantitative relationship between molecular size and crowding strength. To directly visualize these crowding-induced structures, we employed nanodelivery using lipid-loaded nanodiscs, revealing a clear correspondence between condensed crowder regions and diffusion barriers reminiscent of the picket-fence model of live-cell membranes. Similar condensation behavior observed for protein-crowded SLBs demonstrates the generality of this crowding-driven mechanism. Together, these findings establish surface-density-driven crowding and condensation of membrane-anchored macromolecules as a key physical mechanism underlying lateral membrane inhomogeneity and position nanodelivery as a general approach for interrogating membrane organization across synthetic and biological systems.",

    "summary": "Many cheminformatics workflows use Tanimoto similarity between binary fingerprints. When count fingerprints may be more appropriate, the benefit is often not large enough to justify replacing existing clustering tools, database search components, and other often highly optimized binary methods. This paper proposes a novel method based on random superimposed coding to convert count fingerprints to binary fingerprints such that the binary Tanimoto similarity between two binary fingerprints better approximates the multiset Tanimoto similarity between their original count form. In particular, the k-recall@k score for -nearest neighbor search is consistently better than hash-based folding or RDKit's count simulation conversion across the four count fingerprint generators in the RDKit, if the number of features is relatively small compared to the binary fingerprint size. For example, with 2048-bit Morgan fingerprints of radius 3, the recall at  for folded, count simulation, and superimposed coding are approximately 0.80, 0.86, and 0.94, respectively.",

    "summary": "The Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP) unifies several landmark quantum algorithms, yet systematic exploration of its variants and modern applications has slowed. This paper revives HSP-based algorithm design by examining new group structures with direct relevance to post-quantum cryptography, lattice problems, and structured optimization. We classify a family of finite and continuous groups-extensions and semi-direct products of abelian groups, matrix groups, and certain non-abelian groups-according to their Fourier-theoretic properties and the feasibility of efficient quantum Fourier transforms (QFTs). For each class, we determine whether the HSP admits an efficient quantum algorithm, a subexponential-time quantum algorithm, or appears intractable even quantumly. We construct explicit algorithms for eight new problem families, including structured lattice enumeration, automorphism groups of certain graphs, and algebraic attack primitives appearing in code-based and multivariate cryptosystems. For these, we show superpolynomial quantum speedups over all known classical approaches under standard complexity assumptions. We also discuss how approximate and block-encoded QFTs can be combined with variational post-processing to make some of these HSP algorithms more NISQ-friendly. Our results demonstrate that algebraic-structure-based quantum algorithms remain a rich and underexploited direction with both theoretical depth and potential cryptanalytic and optimization applications.",

    "summary": "Genome-scale metabolic network (GSMN) models are rigorously curated, cellular-level representations of metabolism that enable flux-based metabolite fate discovery, metabolic engineering, drug target identification and context-specific multi-omics integration. However, the inherent complexity of model architectures, need for programming skills and limited visualization support restrict their broader applicability. Existing tools focus on visualization and analyses separately, necessitating tool-specific format conversions, offer either topology or flux analyses options exclusively, lack intuitive pathway-specific visualizations, database-integrated model refinement, pathway enrichment and large-scale perturbation analyses. Here, we present NAViFluX (metabolic Network Analysis and Visualization of Flux), a visualization-centric, web browser-based environment that unifies GSMN exploration through native pathway/subsystem map generation using various layouts; interactive refinement through addition of reactions from KEGG/BiGG, amending constraints, pathway merging; and modules for flux computations, topology, functional enrichment. Instead of treating visualization as a post hoc step, NAViFluX performs all actions within network views, enabling users to make decisions directly from visually interpretable subnetworks. Using three Escherichia coli case studies, NAViFluX is shown to characterize nutrient-specific metabolic adaptations, improve metabolic gene essentiality predictions, provide mechanistic insight into synthetic lethality and facilitate the design of an optimized carbon-fixing metabolic state, thereby democratizing GSMNs for biologically meaningful applications.",
