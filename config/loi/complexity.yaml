custom_instructions: |
  - Prioritize papers on emergence, self-organization, and information-theoretic approaches to complex systems.
  - Include work on Hopfield networks, assembly theory, and chemical organization theory.
  - Deprioritize purely computational/algorithmic papers unless they relate to natural or biological computation.
  - Papers connecting complexity to origins of life, evolution, or biological systems are highly relevant.
