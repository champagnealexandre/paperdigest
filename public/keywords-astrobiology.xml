    <title>🟡 astro-ph.EP updates on arXiv.org ➤ Seafloor Weathering and Stochastic Outgassing Unlikely to Significantly Shorten the Future Lifespan of Earth&#39;s Terrestrial Biosphere</title>

    <summary>Using a coupled climate–weathering model, the authors find that even with potentially strong seafloor weathering feedbacks or unusually large stochastic CO2 outgassing variations, Earth’s terrestrial biosphere is still likely to persist for &gt;1 Gyr, with implications for long-term planetary habitability and exoplanet climate stability.</summary>

    arXiv:2512.24538v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Current understanding suggests that as the Sun brightens in the far future, Earth&amp;#x27;s carbonate-silicate cycle will offset increasing temperatures by drawing CO$_2$ out of the atmosphere, ultimately leading to the extinction of all terrestrial plant life via either overheating or CO$_2$ starvation. Most previous estimates put the future lifespan of Earth&amp;#x27;s terrestrial biosphere at $\sim$1 billion yr, but recent work used a new coupled climate-continental weathering model with up-to-date parameter constraints to revise this estimate upward to 1.6-1.86 billion yr. In this study, we extend the model to examine the impacts of seafloor weathering and stochastic variations in CO$_2$ outgassing rates on the remaining lifespan of Earth&amp;#x27;s terrestrial biosphere. We find that if seafloor weathering has a stronger feedback than continental weathering and accounts for a large portion of global silicate weathering, then the remaining lifespan of the terrestrial biosphere can be shortened, but a lifespan of more than 1 billion yr (Gyr) remains likely. Similarly, stochastic fluctuations in outgassing rates can have a significant impact if the size of the fluctuations exceed those observed over the last 1 billion yr. The impact of weak seafloor weathering and lower variability stochasticity are minor. Our work provisionally supports a lengthened lifespan of Earth&amp;#x27;s terrestrial biosphere, suggests robustness of this lengthened lifespan to planetary parameters that may vary among exoplanets, and identifies seafloor weathering as a key process that requires further study and constraint.

    <summary>Reviews a combinatorial state-enumeration framework for irreversible aggregation (Marcus–Lushnikov/Smoluchowski) with explicit results for several kernels and applications including aerosol growth and planetesimal formation, offering broadly relevant modeling tools but limited direct connection to prebiotic chemistry or origins-of-life mechanisms.</summary>

    arXiv:2512.11459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach&amp;#x27;s assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.
