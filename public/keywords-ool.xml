    arXiv:2512.24792v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that cause misclassification when specific perturbations are added to input images. This vulnerability also threatens the reliability of DNN-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) models, making robustness enhancement a critical need in practical applications. To validate the vulnerability of DNN-based MDE models, this study proposes a projection-based adversarial attack method that projects perturbation light onto a target object. The proposed method employs physics-in-the-loop (PITL) optimization -- evaluating candidate solutions in actual environments to account for device specifications and disturbances -- and utilizes a distributed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. Experiments confirmed that the proposed method successfully created adversarial examples that lead to depth misestimations, resulting in parts of objects disappearing from the target scene.

    arXiv:2512.23922v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We study the joint dynamics of membrane potential and time since the last spike in a population of integrate-and-fire neurons using a population density framework. This leads to a two-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation that captures the evolution of the full neuronal state, along with a one-dimensional hierarchy of equations for the moments of the inter-spike interval (ISI). The formalism allows us to characterize the time-dependent ISI distribution, even when the population is far from stationarity, such as under time-varying external input or during network oscillations. By performing a perturbative expansion around the stationary state, we also derive an analytic expression for the linear response of the ISI distribution to weak input modulations.

    <summary>Experimental study of tritium uptake on beryllium vs tungsten and in-situ decontamination tests showing ozone alone is ineffective without UV illumination, with minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</summary>

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    arXiv:2512.24256v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Tritium adsorption on surfaces creates a variety of issues, ranging from the fields of fusion applications to small and large-scale laboratory experiments using tritium. The extent to which tritium accumulates on surfaces is generally material-dependent and must be determined through experiments. Additionally, this surface contamination necessitates the implementation of appropriate decontamination procedures, preferably in-situ. A suitable method could be exposure to ozone during UV irradiation. However, it is currently not known if both components are necessary for the decontamination. At Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe, both questions on contamination and decontamination can be addressed using a single experimental setup. With this, it is possible to expose solid samples to gaseous tritium to measure the temporal activity evolution. Furthermore, the system can be filled with dry air, and dry air containing ozone to explore their decontamination effect. Both measurement modes were applied to beryllium and tungsten samples, which were chosen for their relevance in fusion. The beryllium surface was observed to accumulate tritium more than four times faster than tungsten when exposed to gaseous tritium. Concerning the decontamination, without simultaneous UV irradiation, exposure to ozone did not have any distinct effect on the surface activity compared to simply using dry air. This leads to the conclusion that UV illumination of the surfaces is required to achieve a significant decontamination factor.

    <summary>Presents an open-source RV inference framework (Dynamic Nested Sampling + Adaptive Parallel Tempering MCMC with flexible stellar-noise models) that improves orbit retrieval and model comparison for detecting low-mass exoplanets, offering indirect value to astrobiology via better target identification rather than Origins-of-Life mechanisms.</summary>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    arXiv:2511.05331v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We present EMPEROR, an open-source Python framework designed for efficient exoplanet detection and characterisation with radial velocities (RV). EMPEROR integrates Dynamic Nested Sampling (DNS) and Adaptive Parallel Tempering (APT) Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), supporting multiple noise models such as Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Moving Averages (MA). The framework enables systematic model comparison using statistical metrics, including Bayesian evidence ($\ln{\mathcal{Z}}$) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), while providing automated, publish-ready visualisations. EMPEROR is evaluated across three distinct systems to assess its capabilities in different detection scenarios. Sampling performance, model selection, and the search for Earth-mass planets are evaluated in data for 51 Pegasi, HD 55693 and Barnard&amp;#x27;s Star (GJ 699). For 51 Pegasi, APT achieves an effective sampling increase over DNS by a factor 3.76, while retrieving tighter parameter estimates. For HD 55693 the stellar rotation $P_{\text{rot}}=29.72^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$ and magnetic cycle $P_{\text{mag}}=2557.0^{+70.1}_{-36.7}$ are recovered, while demonstrating the sensitivity of $\ln{\mathcal{Z}}$ to prior selection. For Barnard&amp;#x27;s star, several noise models are compared, and the confirmed planet parameters are successfully retrieved with all of them. The best model shows a period of 3.1536$\pm$0.0003~d, minimum mass of 0.38$\pm$0.03 M$_{\rm{\oplus}}$, and semi-major axis of 0.02315$\pm$0.00039~AU. Purely statistical inference might be insufficient on its own for robust exoplanet detection. Effective methodologies must integrate domain knowledge, heuristic criteria, and multi-faceted model comparisons. The versatility of EMPEROR in handling diverse noise structures, its systematic model selection, and its improved performance make it a valuable tool for RV exoplanetary studies.

    arXiv:2512.24154v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The mechanical properties of actin filaments are essential to their biological functions. Here, we introduce a highly coarse-grained model of actin filaments that preserves helicity and chirality while enabling mesoscale simulations. The framework is implemented in Cytosim, an open-source cytoskeleton simulation platform. We can predict and finely control the shape and mechanical properties of this helical filament, that can be matched to experimental values. Using this model, we investigated the role of filament chirality in motor-driven dynamics. We first show that in two different experimental configurations, motor movement along a helical filament results in a chiral motion of the filament. In a bundle of helical filaments, dimeric motors exert torques on each filament, inducing collective behaviors in the bundle such as rotation, coiling, and helical buckling, reminiscent of those observed in filopodia. Together, these results demonstrate the central role of helicity and chirality in actin mechanics and motor-driven dynamics, and establish our framework as a powerful tool for mesoscale simulations. This framework can also be used for other helical filaments beyond actin.

    arXiv:2512.24543v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Defects trap photocarriers and hinder solar water splitting. The nanoscale photocarrier transport, trapping, and recombination mechanisms are usually inferred from ensemble-averaged measurements and remain elusive. Because an individual high-performing nanoparticle photocatalyst may outperform the ensemble average, design rules that would otherwise enhance catalytic efficiency remain unclear. Here, we introduce photomodulated electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in an optically coupled scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to map photocarrier localization. Using rhodium-doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3:Rh) solar water-splitting nanoparticles, we directly image the carrier densities concentrated at oxygen-vacancy surface trap states. This is achieved by separating photothermal heating from photocarrier populations through experimental and computational analyses of low-loss spectra. Photomodulated STEM-EELS enables angstrom-scale imaging of defect-induced photocarrier traps and their impact on photocatalytic efficiency.

    arXiv:2512.24004v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We explore ion escape from, and solar ion deposition to, \hll{an unmagnetized Earth-like planet}. We use RHybrid, an ion-kinetic electron-fluid code to simulate the global plasma interaction of unmagnetized Earth with the solar wind. We vary the global ionospheric emission rate, and quantify the resultant planetary ion escape rates ($O^+$ and $H^+$) and the solar wind deposition rate ($H^+$). We use these results to compute the net mass flux to the atmosphere and find that the solar ion deposition rate could be comparable to planetary ion escape rates. For the emission rates simulated, our results show that under typical solar wind conditions ($v_{sw} = 400 \ km \ s^{-1}$, $n_{sw} = 5 \ cm^{-3}$), the mass of the atmosphere would decrease by less than 3\% over a billion years, indicating that Earth&amp;#x27;s intrinsic magnetic field may be unnecessary for retention of its atmosphere. Lastly, we present a hypothesis suggesting that ionospheric emission may evolve through time towards a critical emission rate that occurs at a net mass flux of zero.

    <summary>Extends coupled climate–weathering models to test whether seafloor weathering and stochastic CO2 outgassing could materially shorten Earth&#39;s remaining terrestrial biosphere lifetime, finding &gt;1 Gyr still likely except under stronger-than-expected seafloor feedbacks or unusually large outgassing variability—relevant mainly to long-term planetary habitability (and exoplanet analogs) rather than origin-of-life mechanisms.</summary>

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    arXiv:2512.24538v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Current understanding suggests that as the Sun brightens in the far future, Earth&amp;#x27;s carbonate-silicate cycle will offset increasing temperatures by drawing CO$_2$ out of the atmosphere, ultimately leading to the extinction of all terrestrial plant life via either overheating or CO$_2$ starvation. Most previous estimates put the future lifespan of Earth&amp;#x27;s terrestrial biosphere at $\sim$1 billion yr, but recent work used a new coupled climate-continental weathering model with up-to-date parameter constraints to revise this estimate upward to 1.6-1.86 billion yr. In this study, we extend the model to examine the impacts of seafloor weathering and stochastic variations in CO$_2$ outgassing rates on the remaining lifespan of Earth&amp;#x27;s terrestrial biosphere. We find that if seafloor weathering has a stronger feedback than continental weathering and accounts for a large portion of global silicate weathering, then the remaining lifespan of the terrestrial biosphere can be shortened, but a lifespan of more than 1 billion yr (Gyr) remains likely. Similarly, stochastic fluctuations in outgassing rates can have a significant impact if the size of the fluctuations exceed those observed over the last 1 billion yr. The impact of weak seafloor weathering and lower variability stochasticity are minor. Our work provisionally supports a lengthened lifespan of Earth&amp;#x27;s terrestrial biosphere, suggests robustness of this lengthened lifespan to planetary parameters that may vary among exoplanets, and identifies seafloor weathering as a key process that requires further study and constraint.

    arXiv:2512.25054v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Supersymmetric conformal field theories (SCFTs) form a unique subset of quantum field theories which provide powerful insights into strongly coupled critical phenomena. Here, we present a microscopic and non-perturbative realization of the three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal Ising critical point, based on a Yukawa-type coupling between a 3D Ising CFT and a gauged Majorana fermion. Using the recently developed fuzzy sphere regularization, we directly extract the scaling dimensions of low-lying operators via the state-operator correspondence. At the critical point, we demonstrate conformal multiplet structure together with the hallmark of emergent spacetime supersymmetry through characteristic relations between fermionic and bosonic operators. Moreover, by tuning the Yukawa coupling, we explicitly track the evolution of operator spectra from the decoupled Ising-Majorana fixed point to the interacting superconformal fixed point, revealing renormalization-group flow at the operator level. Our results establish a controlled, non-perturbative microscopic route to 3D SCFTs.

    arXiv:2509.25332v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Stellar multiplicity plays a crucial role in shaping planet formation and dynamical evolution. We present a survey of 54 TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) within 300 pc that exhibit significant Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric accelerations. We identified 35 TOIs with stellar companions at projected separations between $0.1^{\prime\prime}$ to $2^{\prime\prime}$ (or $10-200$ AU). We also identified 12 TOIs that could host planetary-mass or brown dwarf companions, including 6 that are newly discovered. Furthermore, we perform three-dimensional orbital characterization for 12 binaries hosting confirmed planets or planet candidates, allowing us to constrain the line-of-sight mutual inclination, $\Delta I_{\mathrm{los}}$, between the planetary and binary orbits. Combining our sample with previous measurements, we apply Bayesian hierarchical analysis to a total of 26 binary systems with S-type transiting planets ($r_p&amp;lt;5R_{\oplus}$). Specifically, we fit the $\Delta I_{\mathrm{los}}$ distribution with both single (Rayleigh) and mixture models (two-component Rayleigh and Rayleigh-isotropic mixture). We find the mixture models are strongly favored ($\log Z\gtrsim13.9$, or $\approx$5$\sigma$), indicating the observed planet-binary $\Delta I_{\mathrm{los}}$ values likely originate from two underlying populations: one nearly aligned ($\sigma_1 = 2^{\circ}.4^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$) and one with more scattered mutual inclinations ($\sigma_2 = 23^{\circ}.6^{+8.8}_{-7.1}$). Alternatively, the misaligned systems can be equally well described by an isotropic distribution of inclinations. This observed dichotomy likely reflects different dynamical histories. Notably, the misaligned population only emerges in systems with stellar periastron distances $&amp;gt;40$ AU while systems with close-in or eccentric stellar companions (periastron distances $&amp;lt;40$ AU) preserve planet-binary alignment.

    <summary>Uses DFT- and MB-pol–trained machine-learning potentials with path-integral MD to quantify nuclear-quantum effects on ice Ih melting and water anomalies (Tm isotope shift, density discontinuity, density maximum), improving physical fidelity of water models relevant to planetary habitability contexts.</summary>

    arXiv:2512.23939v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Liquid water exhibits several important anomalous properties in the vicinity of the melting temperature ($T_{\mathrm{m}}$) of ice Ih, including a higher density than ice and a density maximum at 4~$^{\circ}$C. Experimentally, an isotope effect on $T_{\mathrm{m}}$ is observed: the melting temperature of H$_2$O is approximately 4~K lower than that of D$_2$O. This difference can only be explained by nuclear quantum effects (NQEs), which can be accurately captured using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD). Here we run PIMD simulations driven by Deep Potential (DP) models trained on data from density functional theory (DFT) based on SCAN, revPBE0-D3, SCAN0, and revPBE-D3 and a DP model trained on the MB-pol potential. We calculate the \tm of ice, the density discontinuity at melting, and the temperature of density maximum ($T_{\mathrm{dm}}$) of the liquid. We find that the model based on MB-pol agrees well with experiment. The models based on DFT incorrectly predict that NQEs lower $T_{\mathrm{m}}$. For the density discontinuity, SCAN and SCAN0 predict values close to the experimental result, while revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 significantly underestimate it. Additionally, the models based on SCAN and SCAN0 correctly predict that the $T_{\mathrm{dm}}$ is higher than $T_{\mathrm{m}}$, while those based on revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 predict the opposite. We attribute the deviations of the DFT-based models from experiment to the overestimation of hydrogen bond strength. Our results set the stage for more accurate simulations of aqueous systems grounded on DFT.

    arXiv:2512.24900v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: A capacitor consisting of the [bmim][NTf$_2$] ionic liquid (IL) confined in between planar graphite electrodes has been investigated by molecular dynamics based on an all-atom, unpolarizable force field. Structural and dynamical properties such as: (i) the density and orientation of the [bmim]$^+$ and [NTf$_2$]$^-$ ions throughout the capacitor; (ii) the electrostatic double layer at the electrode / electrolyte interface; (iii) the ions&amp;#x27; mobility perpendicular and parallel to the graphite plates are determined as a function of the electrostatic charge of the capacitor, the concentration of absorbed water, the temperature and pressure. Grouping the [bmim]$^+$ and [NTf$_2$]$^-$ ions into neutral ion pairs reveals an intriguing ordering normal to the interface that is related to correlations among the dipole moments of the neutral ion pairs. These correlations might explain the observation of an anomalous Stark effect (Pockels effect) reported a few years ago in Langmuir, vol. 37, 5193-5201, (2021), and provides useful insight for the multitude of electro-chemical applications that involve electrode / ionic liquid interfaces.

    arXiv:2508.12223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Guiding active motion is important for targeted delivery, sensing, and search tasks. Many active systems exhibit circular swimming, ubiquitous in chemical, physical, and biological systems, that biases motion and reduces transport efficiency. We show that stochastic position-orientation resetting can overcome these limitations in two-dimensional chiral active Brownian particles by interrupting circular motion, resulting in tunable dynamics. When resets are infrequent compared to chiral rotation, the steady-state mean-squared displacement varies non-monotonically with rotational diffusion. Steady state excess kurtosis and orientation autocorrelation yields spatiotemporal state diagram comprising three states: an activity-dominated chiral state, and two resetting-dominated states with and without chiral rotation; in contrast, the achiral(or non-chiral) counterpart supports only the resetting-dominated state without chiral rotation. Chirality thus enriches the dynamical landscape, enabling tunable transitions between transport modes absent in achiral systems. A simple reset protocol can therefore transform chiral active dynamics and offer a practical strategy for optimizing search and transport in circle swimmers.

    <summary>Benchmarks first-principles and machine-learning-driven simulations (with nuclear quantum effects) for accurately predicting water’s melting properties—information that underpins planetary hydrology and habitability assessments but is not directly focused on origins-of-life chemistry.</summary>

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    arXiv:2512.23940v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: First-principles simulations have played a crucial role in deepening our understanding of the thermodynamic properties of water, and machine learning potentials (MLPs) trained on these first-principles data widen the range of accessible properties. However, the capabilities of different first-principles methods are not yet fully understood due to the lack of systematic benchmarks, the underestimation of the uncertainties introduced by MLPs, and the neglect of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs). Here, we systematically assess first-principles methods by calculating key melting properties using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) driven by Deep Potential (DP) models trained on data from density functional theory (DFT) with SCAN, revPBE0-D3, SCAN0 and revPBE-D3 functionals, as well as from the MB-pol potential. We find that MB-pol is in qualitatively good agreement with the experiment in all properties tested, whereas the four DFT functionals incorrectly predict that NQEs increase the melting temperature. SCAN and SCAN0 slightly underestimate the density change between water and ice upon melting, but revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 severely underestimate it. Moreover, SCAN and SCAN0 correctly predict that the maximum liquid density occurs at a temperature higher than the melting point, while revPBE-D3 and revPBE0-D3 predict the opposite behavior. Our results highlight limitations in widely used first-principles methods and call for a reassessment of their predictive power in aqueous systems.

    arXiv:2512.25074v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Randomness generation through quantum-chaotic evolution underpins foundational questions in statistical mechanics and applications across quantum information science, including benchmarking, tomography, metrology, and demonstrations of quantum computational advantage. While statistical mechanics successfully captures the temporal averages of local observables, understanding randomness at the level of higher statistical moments remains a daunting challenge, with analytic progress largely confined to random quantum circuit models or fine-tuned systems exhibiting space-time duality. Here we study how much randomness can be dynamically generated by generic quantum-chaotic evolution under physical, non-random Hamiltonians. Combining theoretical insights with numerical simulations, we show that for broad classes of initially unentangled states, the dynamics become effectively Haar-random well before the system can ergodically explore the physically accessible Hilbert space. Both local and highly nonlocal observables, including entanglement measures, equilibrate to their Haar expectation values and fluctuations on polynomial timescales with remarkably high numerical precision, and with the fastest randomization occurring in regions of parameter space previously identified as maximally chaotic. Interestingly, this effective randomization can occur on timescales linear in system size, suggesting that the sub-ballistic growth of Renyi entropies typically observed in systems with conservation laws can be bypassed in non-random Hamiltonians with an appropriate choice of initial conditions.

In this setting, we explicitly compute the time evolution of quantities such as the mean and distributions of different types. This allows us in particular to estimate the proportions of different types in the long run, as well as the distribution of the first time of occurrence of a given type as the tree size or time increases. Our approach relies on the recursive computation of the joint distribution of types conditionally to the value of the total progeny. In comparison with the literature on related multitype models, we do not rely on approximations.

Instead, treating the temporal and spatial directions on equal footing, one determines the spatiotemporally periodic orbits that contribute to the partition sum of the theory, each a solution of the system&amp;#x27;s defining deterministic equations, with sums over time-periodic orbits of dynamical systems theory replaced here by sums of d-periodic orbits over d-dimensional spacetime geometries, the weight of each orbit given by the Jacobian of its spatiotemporal orbit Jacobian operator. The weights, evaluated by application of the Bloch theorem to the spectrum of periodic orbit&amp;#x27;s Jacobian operator, are multiplicative for spacetime orbit repeats, leading to a spatiotemporal zeta function formulation of the theory in terms of prime orbits.

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    arXiv:2312.01115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Magnus expansion (ME) provides a general way to expand the real-time propagator of a time-dependent Hamiltonian within the exponential such that the unitarity is satisfied at any order. We use this property and explicit integration of Lagrange interpolation formulas for the time-dependent Hamiltonian within each time interval and derive approximations that preserve unitarity for the differential time evolution operators of general time-dependent Hamiltonians. The resulting second-order approximation is the same as using the average of Hamiltonians for two end points of time. We identify three fourth-order approximations involving commutators of Hamiltonians at different times and also derive a sixth-order expression. A test of these approximations along with other available expressions for a two-state time-dependent Hamiltonian with sinusoidal time dependences provides information on the relative performance of these approximations and suggests that the derived expressions can serve as useful numerical tools for time evolution in time-resolved spectroscopy, quantum control, quantum sensing, real-time ab initio quantum dynamics, and open system quantum dynamics.

    <summary>Develops theoretical constraints to reduce ambiguity in perfect phylogeny mixture models for mutation-based tree inference (primarily tumor evolution), with only indirect methodological relevance to origins-of-life evolutionary reconstruction.</summary>

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    arXiv:2512.24930v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The perfect phylogeny mixture (PPM) model is useful due to its simplicity and applicability in scenarios where mutations can be assumed to accumulate monotonically over time. It is the underlying model in many tools that have been used, for example, to infer phylogenetic trees for tumor evolution and reconstruction. Unfortunately, the PPM model gives rise to substantial ambiguity -- in that many different phylogenetic trees can explain the same observed data -- even in the idealized setting where data are observed perfectly, i.e. fully and without noise. This ambiguity has been studied in this perfect setting by Pradhan et al. 2018, which proposed a procedure to bound the number of solutions given a fixed instance of observation data. Beyond this, studies have been primarily empirical. Recent work (Myers et al. 2019) proposed adding extra constraints to the PPM model to tackle ambiguity. In this paper, we first show that the extra constraints of Myers et al. 2019, called longitudinal constraints (LC), often fail to reduce the number of distinct trees that explain the observations. We then propose novel alternative constraints to limit solution ambiguity and study their impact when the data are observed perfectly. Unlike the analysis in Pradhan et al. 2018, our theoretical results regarding both the inefficacy of the LC and the extent to which our new constrains reduce ambiguity are not tied to a single observation instance. Rather, our theorems hold over large ensembles of possible inference problems. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study degeneracy in the PPM model in this ensemble-based theoretical framework.

    arXiv:2508.20448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: The ice-rubber interface is critical in applications such as tires and shoe outsoles, yet its molecular tribology remains unclear. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we studied premelting layers at the basal face of ice in contact with styrene-butadiene rubber from 254 to 269 K. Despite its hydrophobicity, rubber enhances structural disorder of interfacial water, promoting premelting. In contrast, water mobility is suppressed by confinement from polymer chains, leading to glassy dynamics distinct from the ice-vapor interface. Near the melting point, rubber chains become more flexible and penetrate the premelting layer, forming a mixed rubber-water region that couples the dynamics of both components. These results suggest that nanoscale roughness and morphology of hydrophobic polymers disrupt ice hydrogen-bond networks, thereby enhancing premelting. Our findings provide molecular-level insight into ice slipperiness and inform the design of polymer materials with controlled ice adhesion and friction.

    arXiv:2511.19156v4 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The rapid scaling of artificial intelligence models has revealed a fundamental tension between model capacity (storage) and inference efficiency (computation). While classical information theory focuses on transmission and storage limits, it lacks a unified physical framework to quantify the thermodynamic costs of generating information from compressed laws versus retrieving it from memory. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that treats information processing as an enabling mapping from ontological states to carrier states. We introduce a novel metric, Derivation Entropy, which quantifies the effective work required to compute a target state from a given logical depth. By analyzing the interplay between Shannon entropy (storage) and computational complexity (time/energy), we demonstrate the existence of a critical phase transition point. Below this threshold, memory retrieval is thermodynamically favorable; above it, generative computation becomes the optimal strategy. This &amp;quot;Energy-Time-Space&amp;quot; conservation law provides a physical explanation for the efficiency of generative models and offers a rigorous mathematical bound for designing next-generation, energy-efficient AI architectures. Our findings suggest that the minimization of Derivation Entropy is a governing principle for the evolution of both biological and artificial intelligence.

    arXiv:2512.24427v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We develop an extended Dynamical Mean Field Theory framework to analyze gene regulatory networks (GRNs) incorporating epigenetic modifications. Building on the Hopfield network model analogy to spin glass systems, our approach introduces dynamic terms representing DNA methylation and histone modification to capture their regulatory influence on gene expression. The resulting formulation reduces high-dimensional GRN dynamics to effective stochastic equations, enabling the characterization of both stable and oscillatory states in epigenetically regulated systems. This framework provides a tractable and quantitative method for linking gene regulatory dynamics with epigenetic control, offering new theoretical insights into developmental processes and cell fate decisions.

    <summary>Experiments and modeling show how surface-tension gradients fracture a carbon-black “sumi” film on water–glycerol subphases into star-like crack patterns, with crack number and dynamics controlled by subphase viscosity and effective film stiffness.</summary>

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    arXiv:2512.24830v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Local variations in surface tension can induce complex fracture dynamics in thin interfacial films. Here, we investigate the fracture patterns that emerge when a localized surface-tension perturbation is applied to a sumi film supported on a water-glycerol subphase. Sumi is a traditional Japanese carbon black ink, and this process, referred to as sumi-wari, produces aesthetically pleasing, star-shaped crack patterns with multiple spikes radiating from the perturbation site. The number of crack spikes increases with the viscosity of the subphase, controlled here by the addition of glycerol. Atomic force microscopy measurements reveal that the effective stiffness of the sumi f ilm decreases as glycerol concentration increases. This suggests a strong coupling between the subphase properties and the mechanics of the sumi film. To capture the dynamics of sumi-wari, a phenomenological model is outlined, based on an overdamped equation of motion for particles connected by breakable springs. Numerical simulations reproduce both the morphology and the experimental trends of sumi-wari: the number of cracks and their temporal evolution depend on the spring stiffness, mirroring the behavior observed for subphases with different viscosities. These findings demonstrate how the interplay between surface-tension gradients, subphase properties, and film mechanics governs local fracture and pattern formation in fluid-supported thin films

    <summary>Develops a contact-geometry framework for dissipative nonlinear pattern-forming systems (via the 2D complex Ginzburg–Landau equation), which is conceptually relevant to nonequilibrium self-organization but not directly focused on origins-of-life chemistry or biology.</summary>

    arXiv:2512.04526v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Dissipative nonlinear waves are ubiquitous in nonequilibrium physical systems, and the Complex Ginzburg-Landau Equation (CGLE) serves as a fundamental model for describing their dynamics. This paper develops a contact-geometric formulation of dissipative field theories, extending the least constraint theorem to complex fields and establishing a link between contact geometry and probability measures. By applying this framework to the 2D CGLE, we derive the dissipative Contact Hamilton-Jacobi (CHJ) equation, which governs the evolution of the action functional. Through canonical transformation and travelling-wave reduction, exact solutions of the CHJ equation are obtained. From a probabilistic perspective, we derive the probability density functional of the 2D CGLE, identify a universal switching line that separates different dynamical regimes, and reveal a first-order periodon--soliton phase transition with a hysteresis loop. The conserved contact potential is identified as the key geometric quantity governing pattern formation in dissipative media, playing a role analogous to energy in conservative systems. This contact-geometric framework provides a unified analytical tool for studying pattern selection and state transitions.

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    arXiv:2512.24833v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: These lecture notes are a contribution to the proceedings of the school &amp;quot;Geometric, Algebraic and Topological Methods for Quantum Field Theory&amp;quot;, held in Villa de Leyva, Colombia, from 31st of July to 9th of August 2023. Its intention is to put together several basic tools of classical integrability and contrast them with those available in the formulation of asymptotic symmetries and the definition of canonical charges in gauge theories. We consider as a working example the Chern-Simons theory in 3D dimensions, motivated by its various applications in condensed matter physics, gravity, and black hole physics. We review basic aspects of the canonical formulation, symplectic geometry, Liouville integrability, and Lax Pairs. We define the Hamiltonian formulation of the Chern-Simons action and the canonical generators of the gauge symmetries, which are surface integrals that subject to non-trivial boundary conditions, realize transformations that do change the physical state, namely large (or improper gauge transformations). We propose asymptotic conditions that realize an infinite set of abelian conserved charges associated with integral models. We review two different cases: the Korteweg-de Vries equation for its connection with the Virasoro algebra and fluid dynamics, and the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) hierarchy, as it embeds an infinite class of non-linear notable integrable evolution equations. We propose a concrete example for gravity in 3D with $\Lambda&amp;lt;0$, where we find a near-horizon asymptotic dynamics. We finalize offering some insights on the initial value problem, its connection with integrable systems and flat connections. We study some properties of the Monodromy matrix and recover the infinite KdV charges from the trace invariants extracted from the Monodromy evolution equation that can be written in a Lax form.

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    arXiv:2511.11859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Coarse-graining (CG) reduces molecular details to extend the time and length scales of molecular dynamics simulations to microseconds and micrometers. However, the CG approaches have long been limited by the difficulty of constructing both accurate and transferable models efficiently, considering the large diversity of chemical structures of materials. Among CG force fields, Martini is the most widely used, as it retains essential chemical features while offering substantial computational efficiency. Its most recent version, Martini 3, expands chemical resolution through a much broader bead set, particularly for small molecules. However, this flexibility also complicates the mapping of organic molecules because of context-dependent rules and the lack of standardized procedures. To address this issue, we present an automated framework that builds Martini 3 models directly from SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings by combining a curated bead dictionary with a hierarchical, rule-based algorithm. Our framework, Martini Mapper, generated Martini 3 models for more than 5,000 molecules across four chemically diverse datasets. A curated subset of 1,081 mapped structures was benchmarked through octanol-water free-energy ($\Delta G_{OW}$) and partition-coefficient ($\log P$) calculations, yielding strong agreement with experimental values. The workflow can also map large molecules containing up to 126 heavy atoms, exceeding the capabilities of existing automated approaches. The algorithm and the complete set of more than 5,000 mapped itp/top files are available at the \href{https://github.com/eliobaby/Martini_mapping}{Martini Mapper}. Our framework, therefore, enables systematic and scalable Martini 3 structures for high-throughput simulations relevant to drug discovery and materials design.

    arXiv:2506.20242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: We present a new formulation of the lack-of-fit reduction in non-equilibrium thermodynamics using the path-integral formalism. The formulation is based on the Onsager-Machlup variational principle, and it allows us to find reduced dynamical equations by minimizing information discrepancy with respect to the detailed evolution. The reduced evolution consists of a Hamiltonian vector field and a gradient flow. The reduction method is illustrated on the Kac-Zwanzig model, where we show how irreversibility emerges from purely Hamiltonian evolution by ignoring some degrees of freedom. We also show how to generalize the Fisher information matrix and Kullback-Leibler divergence between two probability distributions to the case when the two distributions are related by the principle of maximum entropy, even in the case when the entropy is not of Boltzmann-Gibbs type (for instance Tsallis-Havrda-Charvat entropy).

    arXiv:2406.15114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: This paper investigates the approximate controllability of linear fractional impulsive evolution equations in Hilbert spaces. The system under consideration involves the Caputo fractional derivative of order $0&amp;lt;\alpha\leq 1$, a closed linear operator generating a strongly continuous semigroup, and instantaneous state jumps governed by bounded linear impulse operators. We first derive an explicit representation of the mild solution by combining fractional solution operators with impulsive operators. Using this representation, we characterize the approximate controllability of the system through a necessary and sufficient condition expressed in terms of the convergence of an associated family of impulsive resolvent operators. This resolvent condition extends the classical criterion for approximate controllability to the fractional impulsive setting. To illustrate the applicability of our theoretical results, a concrete example is provided. The analysis presented here bridges the gap between the well-established theory for integer-order impulsive systems and the more complex fractional case, highlighting the distinct challenges and solutions arising from the interplay of fractional dynamics and impulsive effects.

We view this spatially-extended, nonlocal evolution equation as a Cauchy problem on abstract Banach spaces, with randomness in the synaptic kernel, firing rate function, external stimuli, and initial conditions. We determine conditions on the random data that guarantee existence, uniqueness, and measurability of the solution in an appropriate Banach space, and examine the regularity of the solution in relation to the regularity of the inputs. We present results for linear and nonlinear neural fields, and for the two most common functional setups in the numerical analysis of this problem. In addition to the continuous problem, we analyse in abstract form neural fields that have been spatially discretised, setting the foundations for analysing uncertainty quantification (UQ) schemes.

    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. Because every day is Black Friday at Costco, I choose to go on Saturday. I like to get there early. I always park in the same spot (right next to the cart return), and wait with the other die-hards. It has the thrill of a stakeout, absent any crime or danger. When the doors open, we move toward the entrance in an orderly march. There’s a small gasp upon entry—the kind of quiet awe that one feels before the most epic human achievements, as when stepping across the threshold of St. Peter’s or the Chartres Cathedral. But in this place, there is no baroque majesty, no stained glass, just abundance bathed in light. In the sweep of human history generally marked by scarcity and want, here is bounty on an unimaginable scale; here is a year’s supply of mozzarella sticks; here is a hot dog and a drink for $1.50; here is a monument of our civilization, in more than 600 locations across the United States. I take the ease with which I resort to Costco talk—about produce prices in particular—as a worrying sign that I’ve become a middle-aged bore. But there’s something happening at Costco that I think goes beyond bell peppers (note that my family eats a lot of them, and, boy, are they a bargain). Costco is a marvel not just historically but also in this moment. In an age of broken institutions, insufferable politics, and billionaire businessmen auditioning to be Bond villains, most things feel like they’re getting worse. Costco seems to stay the same. The employees are generally satisfied . The customers are thrilled by the simple act of getting a good deal. All of it makes a unique space in contemporary American life, a space of cooperation, courtesy, and grown-ups mostly acting like grown-ups. It starts with the thing you’re pushing, the vessel into which you shall receive thy bounty. The cart is improbably large yet easily maneuvered through the warehouse’s aisles. Through some invisible quality control, the sad and broken-down ones you find at the supermarket—unlevel, rear wheel locked, front wheel spinning—seem to be ushered quietly into oblivion at Costco. You’re at the helm of a Peterbilt with the handling of a Porsche. Traffic is never light, but things generally move along. Pushing something that large requires an awareness of oneself in space. Those who might need to consult a list or message their spouse— should I grab this brick of cheddar cheese? —seem to know to step off to the side. At my store in Granger, Indiana, where elbows are perhaps not as sharp as at some other locations, patrons appear to have an unspoken patience with the person who wants to give a bag of avocados an extra squeeze, or hold a double shell of raspberries up to the light. There are occasional expressions of camaraderie as well: “We can’t get enough of that stuff,” somebody might say as you load two pillow-size bags of Pirate’s Booty into the cart. You might see the bargain-hunting bonds among Costco shoppers as a function of the chain’s history. To join its ranks costs $65 a year; the store’s membership model originates from a nonprofit wholesale collective for federal employees called Fedco, founded in Los Angeles in the 1940s. The genealogy is complex (a three-hour-long Acquired podcast episode traces it in full), but one trait has endured: the company is animated—even as a for-profit enterprise—by the idea of bringing good value to its members. This has yielded a cultlike loyalty, such that the company can largely rely on happy members to do its advertising and marketing by word of mouth—or perhaps by wearing prized company merch . Kirkland Signature, Costco’s in-house label for hundreds of products, is a kind of anti-brand that happens to be one of the world’s largest for consumer packaged goods. Just buying something under its comically dull logo makes you feel like a smart shopper: You’ve made the wise decision to forgo a better look for a better price. Costco is a place that encourages, and rewards, just knowing the drill—and the drill isn’t hard to figure out: Move along. Don’t block the way. Unload your cart onto the conveyor belt with dispatch, but leave the heavy stuff. Make the barcodes visible. Violators are never exiled, but transgression, I know from experience, is not without shame. Once, I left the cart in front of the flower display loaded down with 120 pounds of water-softening salt. When I returned, the grandmother who was blocked from the flowers (find me a cheaper dozen roses!)—well, she gave me the finger. The veneer of civilization is always thin, even at Costco, as one is reminded before major holidays, or in the vicinity of the samples. When there’s a Christmas feast to be provisioned, or half a bite of pizza to be tasted, order breaks down, and with it, spatial awareness, common courtesy, and the Golden Rule . We’re circling like buzzards; we’re blocking the way; we’re shaking our heads at the nerve of the person who took the last three. But the checkout restores us to our senses. At my Costco, there is usually a line to get in line for the cashier. People can game the system, but most quietly queue up, content to wait their turn to pick a register. The clerks are cheerier than they should be before this endless current of humans and their stuff. Whatever lapses I might have had in the store (did I take a second sample? maybe), here, I’m on my best behavior. Out of the store, car loaded, cart returned, I tighten up and steel myself for the road. Have you seen the way these people drive nowadays? Related: What your favorite grocery store says about you The psychology behind Costco’s free samples ( From 2014 ) Evening Read Americans Need to Party More By Ellen Cushing (Aleksandra Mihajlovic / Connected Archives) This much you already know: Many Americans are alone, friendless, isolated, undersexed, sick of online dating, glued to their couches, and transfixed by their phones, their mouths starting to close over from lack of use. Our national loneliness is an “ urgent public health issue ,” according to the surgeon general. The time we spend socializing in person has plummeted in the past decade, and anxiety and hopelessness have increased. Roughly one in eight Americans reports having no friends; the rest of us, according to my colleague Olga Khazan, never see our friends , stymied by the logistics of scheduling in a world that has become much more frenetic and much less organized around religion and civic clubs. “You can’t,” she writes, “just show up on a Sunday and find a few hundred of your friends in the same building.” But what if you could, at least on a smaller scale? What if there were a way to smush all your friends together in one place—maybe one with drinks and snacks and chairs? What if you could see your work friends and your childhood friends and the people you’ve chatted amiably with at school drop-off all at once instead of scheduling several different dates? What if you could introduce your pals and set them loose to flirt with one another, no apps required? What if you could create your own Elks Lodge, even for just a night? I’m being annoying, obviously—there is a way! It’s parties, and we need more of them. Read the full article. Culture Break Illustration by Shawna X Read.

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    in my undergrad i worked in a proffessors lab (voluntary), the lab was quite toxic, PI (A) treated undergrads as disposable labor and he was quite a predator/verbal harrasser but a genius so still had some respect within the department. Needless to say i hated the lab like many other students and quit after about 6 months. It was so discouraging I couldn&amp;#x27;t imagine myself working in a lab as a career at all. Another a year later, I joined another professor B. He respected work- life balance, was chill and respected his students. I ended up loving the research topic and worked in the lab for over 2 years ended up doing my masters dissertation there. I&amp;#x27;m looking for work in similar areas. I build a good rapport with my supervisor and he showed interest in hiring me in the lab too (didn&amp;#x27;t work out later) I took a course co-taught by A and B, due to deaths in the family and being overworked because of my thesis I couldn&amp;#x27;t do well in that course and barely made it through. It was probably the worst performance I&amp;#x27;ve had in my time at university I&amp;#x27;m an otherwise good student. Recently i started applying and cold emailing labs Prof A somehow met a PI i had written to and gave a completely skewed opinion of me based on the course I performed badly in. He also ended up shit talking me at an informal setting and said he would discurage my supervisor to reccomend me saying it would ruin B&amp;#x27;s credibility to reccomend me further. A has no idea how sincerely i persued my dissertation, spent insane amount of lab hours (13 hrs/day several days). He&amp;#x27;s actively beefing with a student who&amp;#x27;s work ethic and goals he has no idea about. He&amp;#x27;s a well connected person and ruining my career aspects because of a course, when I only have one referee B who I have truly worked hard for and could recognise that. He&amp;#x27;s well connected and I&amp;#x27;m scared how many opportunities I&amp;#x27;m being denied because of this skewed opinion. This is my career and life. Is this how academia is? It&amp;#x27;s truly heartbreaking. submitted by /u/busroute24 [link] [comments]

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube On this week’s episode of The David Frum Show , The Atlantic’ s David Frum opens with his thoughts on the upcoming 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence. He examines the many actions President Donald Trump has taken that run counter to the ideals articulated in 1776, and considers how the Founders’ constitutional genius may ultimately be what frustrates Trump’s attempt to consolidate power. David is then joined by his Atlantic colleague Charlie Warzel, a staff writer and the host of the Galaxy Brain podcast, to discuss the temptations that come with launching a new podcast and the challenge of serving an audience that often rewards extreme content. Together, they talk about the responsibility that comes with hosting a podcast in a media environment that prizes clicks over truth. They also explore how conspiracy theorists have come to function as an alternate reality of “mainstream media,” and why the fight for truth may not yet be lost. Finally, David closes with a discussion of Edward Berenson’s The Trial of Madame Caillaux and what it reveals about how future generations may come to view our own beliefs. [YOUTUBE LINK] The following is a transcript of the episode: David Frum: Hello, and welcome to The David Frum Show . I’m David Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic . My guest this week will be my Atlantic colleague, Charlie Warzel, the host of the Galaxy Brain podcast, and we’ll be talking about our experiences as new podcast hosts. We both launched podcasts this year. Some of the temptations, some of the dangers, and some of the lessons that we have learned from this year in podcasting. My book this week will be a 1992 history book, The Trial of Madame Caillaux , a study of a sensational sex and murder trial in pre – World War I France. But before getting to either of those things, I want to open with some end-of-year thoughts as we conclude 2025 and move into 2026. 2026, of course, is the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, in 1776, and is a powerful anniversary symbol in the American mind. As we move into this year, there are so many things that are going to be memorable and important and wonderful to celebrate. There are also some things happening that are really weird. One of the weirdest of them is a press release by the U.S. Mint just a few weeks ago. They are considering honoring the 250th anniversary of American independence with a set of commemorative, or dollar coins, featuring the image of President Donald Trump. Now, it’’s not literally unprecedented for the United States to put living people on the coinage. It’s not even totally unprecedented for them to put living politicians on the coinage. The first dollar bill had the face of Salman Chase, Secretary of the Treasury in Lincoln’’s Cabinet, on the dollar bill. Salman Chase was a famous egomaniac. One of his contemporary colleagues in the Republican Party said, He’s an excellent man . I think that’s the quote. He’s an excellent man, but he’s got the delusion that the Christian Trinity has four persons in it instead of three , the fourth being Salman Chase himself. So it’’s not unprecedented. There may be other examples as well, but it is strange and shocking at any time for a living person, and especially a living president, to propose to put himself on the coinage of the money of the United States. And if a Founding Father saw that, I think they would be kind of startled. They would be more startled, however, at some more serious things that are happening. Some things that actually, unlike the dollar coin, which is just a project, have already happened in the year 2025. We have seen the president of the United States impose taxes at his sole volition. The Trump Treasury Department issued a release a few days ago that boasted that they had collected $200 billion in tariffs over the year 2025. That’s $200 billion of taxes not authorized by Congress and a flagrant violation of the ideas and literal language of Article 1 of the Constitution, which puts both taxes and tariffs in the hands of Congress. The president and his team are proposing to spend that $200 billion. They’ve had many ideas about how to spend it. Maybe they should give the money to the farmers. Maybe there should be a tax rebate. Maybe they should do something else. But all of those ideas for spending or tax rebates, again, all of those are congressional authority that the president is arrogating to himself—something else that would have startled the founders of the country all those 250 years ago. We’ve seen the growth of an enormous federal police force, ICE, which has recruited and seems to take orders not from any kind of institution of law but from, again, a small team around the president, an almost personal police force of a kind that the United States has not seen before, certainly not on such a scale. And carrying out actions that, again, would have seemed unimaginable only a little while ago. Mass roundups without any kind of due process; mass deportations. Deportation, of course, is a total presidential authority, but usually there’s some kind of hearing. And, of course, until now, you almost always—the deported person is sent back to the place the deported person came from, not to a third country to which they had no contact, and not under conditions that are tantamount to torture or at least serious human-rights abuse. You would send them home. It’s not a crime to be illegally present in the United States. It’s a violation of the law, but it’s not something that you should be tortured for. You should be put on a plane, given a hot meal, and warned, Don’t come back, you’re breaking the rules . We’ve seen the rise of presidential retaliation against media institutions using the regulatory apparatus of the state, regulatory apparatus that belongs to everybody, not just to him. And then using those same grants of threats, grants of regulatory favors or threats of the withholding of regulatory favors, to rearrange or redirect existing media companies to be more favorable to him, sometimes successfully, sometimes less so, but always with a kind of intent that would have seemed very sinister from the point of view of the founders of the American Republic. And we have seen, maybe most disturbing of all, the use of presidential war powers without any involvement of any kind of legal authority, any kind of congressional authority. We’re on the cusp, apparently, of some kind of military action against Venezuela—maybe airstrikes, maybe clandestine strikes of commandos, maybe something more. There’s no pretense that there’s any congressional authorization of that. And over the Christmas holiday, the president fired missiles into Nigeria, intervening in Nigerian civil strife, again, with no pretense of any kind of authorization by anyone other than the president at his own whim. So the big question for the year 2026 is: How far has the country drifted from those ideals of 1776 as formalized in the Constitution of 1787 and all the amendments afterwards? And how does the United States move back to the country it intended to be at the beginning, that Americans believed it to be until very recently, and that I think most Americans still want it to be. Now, here’s some good news. It does seem like over the course of 2025, that these lawless actions have lost some of their impact and power. The bad guys seem to be losing a little political altitude as we move into 2026. I don’t want to be overconfident about that. I don’t want to issue false promises. But it does seem like the ebb and flow of political power is not favoring those who want to use arbitrary power in the way they’ve used it. Some examples: There does seem to be, in this second Trump term, a real loss of focus, an inability to keep the main thing the main thing. The battle over renaming the Kennedy Center the Trump Kennedy Center: That seems like a perfect example of something that any serious authoritarian president would not waste energy over. What does he care? He’s staffed it with his cronies. They’re going to do the shows that he likes; he’s gonna be able to blackball the people he doesn’t like. Does he really need to put his name on it? Does he need to host the Kennedy Honors on prime-time television? Is that really something that he needs to invest energy in? And even the dollar coins, that just makes enemies. Why are you doing that? What is the petty, pathetic need that makes you trade the substance of political power for these childish shows? But that need is there and it’s a political fact, and it’s an expensive political fact—and therefore for those who oppose the authoritarian project, a hopeful political fact. But more substantially, two other things are happening that are really changing the political calculus as we move into the year 2026. One is the weakening of the American economy. One of the things that any successful authoritarian knows is you have to get the economy right. People will put up with a lot if they’re feeling prosperous. As they enter 2026, fewer and fewer Americans are feeling prosperous. Prices are rising; job creation is stalling. The center of energy in the American economy is the artificial-intelligence-investment boom. That may continue, it may not, but through the rest of the economy, it’s trouble. Everywhere there’s signs of trouble: rising corporate bankruptcies, defaults on automobile loans. Americans are not feeling like Trump is thinking of them as he thinks of himself. Trump 1, the theory seemed to be that the public would forgive Trump’s actions if he provided economic prosperity. Trump 2, the president is actually actively attacking prosperity through his taxes and tariffs, through his immigration policy, shrinking the American population, shrinking the American workforce. And it seems like that’s his agenda. So what do you get for putting up with it? Nothing, just a kick in the head. But the last thing, and Michael Waldman and I discussed this earlier this year in an important podcast discussion: Trump has lost much of his bet to centralize the management of elections in his own hands. Not all of the bet. He’s still got tricks up his sleeve. There are many things he’s trying to do. But through the genius of American federalism, which is part of the genius of 1776 and 1787, election management is left in the hands of the state, of the several states. And while it’s not impossible for a president to squeeze and coax and coerce and rig those elections, there are limits to his ability to do it. In the end, it is a state power governed by the actions of the states and administered by officials of the states. And there is a limit to how much the president can successfully intervene to corrupt or distort that process. Now, if the election is close, those interventions and distortions may be enough. But when you have, through bad economic policy, you’ve stoked so much discontent as this administration has, you may have moved the whole political temperature—the whole political balance of political forces—beyond the margin of successful manipulation. And that means that the corrective response, that the genius of the system always anticipated as the ultimate answer to abuses, that corrective response may be coming, and 2026 may be the year that we feel it. And now, my dialogue with Charlie Warzel. [ Music ] Frum: So The Atlantic is, today, presenting something a little different. I will interview today my colleague Charlie Warzel, who has launched his own new podcast on the Atlantic channel, Galaxy Brain . We’ll be talking back and forth. Since the Galaxy Brain podcast is quite new, I’m going to read a little introduction for those of you who don’t know Charlie. He joined The Atlantic in 2021 and became a staff writer in 2022. This year, he launched his new podcast, Galaxy Brain . Charlie is a graduate of Hamilton College and he’s the author of the 2021 book Out of Office: Unlocking the Power and Potential of Hybrid Work . And we’re gonna talk about some of the experiences, challenges, temptations of doing a podcast in this day and age, especially for The Atlantic . And I’m happy to welcome Charlie. Charlie, congratulations on the new podcast. Charlie Warzel: Thank you. Thank you for having me. This is great. Frum: All right, so we’re both kind of newbies. I’m like a grizzled veteran with like a three or four month head start ahead of you, so that makes me a frontline soldier. But we’re both familiar with being guests on podcasts, but new to hosting. Warzel: Yes. And it’s very different. Right? It is a whole different, at least I’ve found, it’s a completely different animal being on the other side. Frum: If I’d known how hard it was, I would’ve been nicer to my hosts. Warzel: Exactly. Exactly. Yes. It’s very difficult to construct a conversation and have a flow and end up in the right place and follow the tributaries of a guest’s meandering mind. It’s—definitely, it’s fascinating. Frum: Well, so here’s this thing. In order to avoid meandering, here’s how I propose to channel the conversation so that we achieve something that’s I hope useful and interesting for our listeners and viewers, and maybe something we both ourselves will learn from. Because one of the things we’ve had to confront as we enter this is: Unlike old-fashioned book writing, or text based or even print journalism, where you don’t know exactly what your readers want and what they read, you know a lot about the podcast audience, both video and audio. And we also have the contrasting examples of other people in the space who demonstrate what viewers and listeners want and don’t want. And one of the things we’ve had to confront is the tremendous appetite, or apparent appetite, for extreme content, which flies in the face of what The Atlantic is always trying to provide, which is balanced content. How do we make sense of that? How do we respond to that? I mean, I think you get a lot of response to if you do a show on Was Hitler good? Yes. But we’re not going to do the Was Hitler good? Yes show. But how do you cope with the massive incentives to do a show on Was Hitler good? Yes. Warzel: I see this as part of a bigger struggle, right? I write a lot about technology, about media, media ecology, the ways that social media has warped or changed or transformed society. It’s a lot of what the podcast is about. And so there’s always like a meta element to everything that I am both doing in my actual work and what I am reporting on. And, they tend to feed each other, right? So I look at this as. I look at podcasting, especially video podcasting and the regular, traditional podcasting as, in many ways, almost the traditional problems with internet based or digital media on steroids, right? We are now, because of the issues of discovery, because of, you know, the advent of everything from generative AI to social networks, to declining readership because a lot of the social platforms have given up on news to some degree. We don’t get that same bump from Google. We don’t get that same bump from Facebook, et cetera. It has pushed everything to be so much more algorithmically driven. Right. We try to make the best journalistic products that we can, the most responsible ones, but at the end of the day, we are also people who are interested in having that have an impact in the world, to reach as many people as possible, and these algorithms are tailored more and more and more to be, to promote, the most sensational thing. The thing that outrages, the thing that shocks, the thing that elicits the greatest response, and the greatest response of all of those emotional reactions is outrage, is fear, is shock, is anger. Right? And so I look at what we’re doing right now as having to chase this type of viewership. We are in this attention economy. We are basically forced to, if we want people to interact with the thing that we have spent all this time laboring over. We have to find a way to frame it, right? I think a lot of this is like a marketplace. And every vendor is out there needing to, you know, get people and attract people. And so you’re constantly reaching there. And it’s difficult, because it pushes people to be the worst versions of themselves. And we have to guard against that. We can’t, you know, succumb to that, like, say, a random person on Twitter or X might. Frum: Yeah. Now you’re blaming the algorithm a lot here, which is a non-sentient collection of digits. And that’s convenient because it has no feelings. Maybe the user, the listener, the reader is a little bit to blame? Warzel: Well, so there’s a very interesting issue that I have always seen, right? I hate to blame the reader, because the reader is also in some sense— Frum: the customer, and no one ever got anywhere by disrespecting the customer, at least not in public. But let’s pretend we’re in private for a minute. Warzel: Absolutely. I think that this is a problem. People’s actual preference and their stated preference is always very different, in all consumerism but especially with the news. You see a lot of people both online and in reader surveys of all kinds of different places where I’ve worked, and they say that they want to read more about the vegetables, right, like eat-your-vegetables-type stuff. They want to read about climate change more. Anyone who has worked in digital media, in any case, and has access to the metrics, can see that stories about climate change, very broadly speaking, do not perform as well as stories about, say, Donald Trump or somebody who is constantly stoking outrage. So there is this real reader preference: stated versus actual, right. People are clicking on the outrageous things, the thumbnails with people’s eyes that are, you know, bulging out and stuff like that, and not spending time with that really nuanced headline that is actually, quote unquote, you know, boring, butinside is a very nutritional and dense and smart story. Frum: Well, this is not a new thing. This has been true as long as there is media. I mean, I remember a passage in Proust’s great novel Remembrance of Things Past where a character says, who has a beautiful library full of hand-tooled volumes, which he never opens, and he thinks, What if every morning they were delivered to my front door in sheet paper, a copy of Pascal’s Pensées . And in that leather-bound edition up there, which I open once every 10 years, there was a description of the dress worn by the duchess of so-and-so at the party last night. So media is always sensational, but here’s to my mind, the difference. In1975, there probably were as many people in the United States who wanted to read, or proportionally as many people, who wanted to read or consume Nazi-based content as there were today, or anti-Semitic content as there are today. But either silently or even explicitly, the heads of CBS, ABC, NBC, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, Time, Newsweek, that was the media, said, You know what? They want Nazi content; they want anti-Semitic content. They’re not going to get it. We’re not going to give it to them. And if we 10 people agree we’re not going to give them Nazi content, then they have to get it from pretty obscure places. But there was always that market. There was money waiting. There was a hundred-dollar bill lying on the sidewalk and no one picked it up. And we have a more competitive marketplace, and somebody picks it up. Warzel: This is a little bit, though, why I blame the algorithms so fully, right? Because the algorithms are also very powerful in terms of broadcasting and boosting the people who are willing to do that thing, right? These people don’t just come out of nowhere. You know, I think very broadly of the ecosystem that you and I are now a part of, which is YouTube . YouTube’s great innovation, greatest success, the thing that has driven it to be a place where people are ingesting hundreds of millions of hours daily of video content, is the recommendation algorithm—the “up next” part of YouTube, where, on the right side of your page, it feeds you another video after. That recommendation algorithm, as my reporting and other people’s reporting has shown over the years, brings people into—people call it the rabbit hole, right? Where you watch something, let’s say it’s just a World War II explanation video, right? A history podcast of World War II that’s not racist or anti-Semitic at all, but they’re talking about Hitler a lot. They’re talking about difficult subjects, maybe the Holocaust, something like that. And then you get another video, and that video is maybe just one-tenth of 1 percent, a little more extreme right? Or someone who’s coming from a little bit more of a far-right perspective. Fast forward, you can get people down into this funnel, and that is an algorithmic boost, and that’s why I think this is important. Frum: Okay, I sometimes do go down World War II rabbit holes. I’m interested in the subject like every Baby Boomer. And I find that as I keep going, what the algorithm serves me is increasingly technical content. Well, what was the difference between a 16-inch and a 14-inch naval gun in World War II? Was the 16-inch gun, in fact, better? It gets more technical, more specific, more wonky. And I think I’m telling the algorithm, you know, that’s what I want. So there is the kind of thing where we say, Ah, we’re making it a little more Hitlery . Yes, that’s the algorithm, but that’s the algorithm knowing you, your real self. And it used to be that in, like in 1975, CBS would say, You know what? You want stuff that’s a little more Hitlery than we’re serving, but you’re not going to get it. And now the consumer is driving things. Isn’t he or she? He. I think in World War II, Hitler— Warzel: I think we’re safe to say he—watching the World War II videos. I agree with that, in part. But I think that there are other elements here. I was looking a little bit into—and we talked a bit about discussing—this new media ecosystem and the extremism that it can go towards. And I’ve been following her career somewhat closely, but looking a little bit more into Candace Owens and listening to a couple of popular things that she has put out. She’s obviously a very extreme voice on the right, very conspiratorial. And there’s a great column, a week ago in The New York Times by Michelle Goldberg about Candace Owens and how she has played into the conspiracy theory that Charlie Kirk was not killed by the man who was arrested. And actually had a media summit with Charlie Kirk’s widow, Erica Kirk. But something that Michelle notices in that piece, and I think is very apt, is that she, Candace Owens, draws a lot from the true-crime genre, which is an extremely popular genre of podcast and media now, and plays a little bit towards the digital sleuths on the internet. So these are people who are, you know, vigilante investigators, right? They’re taking all the information available on the internet, trying to follow the lead like they’re a detective pursuing a cold case. And she does a very good job at that, at bringing people along for the hunt of information and giving them these breadcrumbs and telling them, you know, This story’s not right . And I think that that is a part of why people who are looking for that, who are looking to play this role of detective, or who feel that we don’t have the full story. there’s information out there; I can piece it together because I have the ability. That is where I think the algorithm can intersect with a creator who is trying to manipulate. And then it can lead you into a path that gets you into a place that’s a little more, as you put it, Hitlery, because I don’t think people are necessarily, broadly speaking, just saying, Yeah, that was good about World War II. I want some Hitler now . Right? I think what it is, is they believe there’s a conspiracy. Frum: Explain something that baffles me. So if I go on the internet, if I’m having trouble getting the little disc battery into my key fob, my car-key fob, and I’m flummoxed and the written instructions aren’t helpful, and I go online to find a YouTube video—say, how do I get the disc battery into the key fob? If there’s someone there saying, Leave it on the doorstep and the leprechaun overnight with a little bit of milk, and the leprechauns will come and fix the key fob for you —you know what? I’m skipping that one. That doesn’t sound like it’s gonna work. Warzel: Right. Frum: So why don’t people have that response? Like, there’s a killing. The police have arrested somebody. There is a suspect. It may not be that person, but the idea that there’s some global conspiracy of leprechauns who did it instead, that’s pretty unlikely. As it is, they will save my key fob for me. Yes, I take the point about the digital-sleuth thing, but at some level, people have to have, like, a common-sense meter, don’t they? Warzel: But what if, instead, right, it was someone who is making a video who was saying, You’re getting screwed by your car company. Your car company nickels-and-dimes you on all of the things when you take it in for service. They overcharge you. They’re this big corporation, you know. They’re owned by whatever shadowy people, right, who have their own agendas in whatever, who are using your money. And, you know, they’re funding their indulgent lifestyles, and who knows what they’re doing, right,when they take their private planes, X, Y, and Z? A And this battery thing, right, is actually a manifestation of this broader thing. There’s something bigger about the fact that your battery dies too early, right, on your key fob. And that’s the thing. Because it opens up this world to people where they say, Okay, now, now I understand. The unlock in my brain for why conspiracy theories are so popular now in, in culture—they’ve always been popular; obviously the paranoid mind is a fixture in all of history, but especially American history. These theories, however strange or stupid or completely implausible they might be on a given subject: They give people an understanding of why the world feels unfair or wrong or bad, right? And in a moment where there are a lot of people who are struggling, who are very disenchanted, who feel that there is no predictable pathway to success or that the American dream is out of reach for them—even something as small as the key-fob conspiracy explains one small bit of why they feel like crap all the time. Frum: One of the things I have taken from the past, from this Trump era, the past decade of discussion, is—it’s a trope. It’s something we are supposed to say, that things are increasingly difficult for people. It’s understandable that there’s a lot of resentment and anger. I find myself, maybe I’m just becoming crankier, less and less patient with that. I mean, we live, if you’re an American in the year 2026, you live at the apex, the summit of civilization. Never so much material prosperity, never so much medical prosperity. And in particular the science of preserving life and health has never been better, never approached what you have today. So when you see people saying, My conspiracy theory is to reject the gifts of modern medical science and to subject my child to measles. So you know what? I don’t believe it, that you’re having such a tough time. All right? Anyway, if you are having such a tough time, I think that doesn’t excuse you. And if your response to having a tough time is to deny your child the measles vaccine, then your tough time may be a result of your own deficiencies, not something that society is doing. If you’re gonna do something that callous, negligent, potentially homicidal to your child—you’re to blame. You are the problem. It’s not the bankers; it’s not deindustrialization; it’s not the crisis of modernity. It’s you, dumb head. It’s you. Vaccinate your child. Warzel: Well, first off, I fully agree that if you are denying your child vaccines or things like that, that is on you. I understand that there is this fatigue, right, with trying to rationalize the reasons why people are falling down these rabbit holes or doing ridiculous things. I kind of hold it in my mind slightly differently, which is that I’m not seeing everyone as just these absolutely passive observers, but I do see people as being relatively easily manipulated. When you combine this idea of I am frustrated; I feel bad; I can’t see the progress of modernity in this way —when you combine that with really savvy manipulators and then a culture that forms around all of that, a tribalism that forms around this, that, okay, it’s not only that I’m denying, I don’t believe in vaccines, I’m denying this; it becomes a group, a team, a thing, a cohort, a sense of belonging. And that is a very strong psychological bond. And so it’s not necessarily that I’m saying these people don’t have any agency, or that they can’t be blamed for, you know, essentially endangering the lives of their children or doing whatever awful thing. But I see this as like all of these systems making it very hard for people to break out of that mold, to do the right thing, to go against the grain of those people. Frum: So while we’re talking about agency, what are we going to do? So here we are, we’re now co-manufacturers of this reality in a very modest way, but there we are. We’re part of it. What do we do? How do we be forces for good and effective forces for good rather than forces for ill or ineffective forces for good? Warzel: I think that’s really difficult. Something that our boss, Adrienne LaFrance, who’s the executive editor of The Atlantic , said on a podcast I did with her recently, which was about—we were covering the Epstein files, the first dump of all this. And at the very end of the podcast, I asked, Well, what the heck did we learn here? There’s all this information. And one thing that she said about this, the durability of the Epstein conspiracy theory is that people still want the truth, right? That is also at the heart of all of this conspiratorial crap that we are dealing with. There are a lot of people who have this impulse, who want the truth, who believe they’re not getting the truth, and that leads them down these difficult paths. But that is actually our job, right? We are purveyors of, in an ideal world, of that. We are trying to harness this; we are trying to do that. So, you know, I almost think in some ways that the, whatever you want to call it, the mainstream media, you and me, whatever it is—we need to take that back, I think, more strongly than we do. We can be a little milquetoast about this. I think we need to say that if you’re on the hunt, if you’re trying to be a digital vigilante investigator, then you need to be looking here for the truth, which is here, and we are the people who are going to, you know, do that job. Frum: One of my New Year’s resolutions is I’m going to not only refrain from using, but actually actively object, to the phrase mainstream media . Because if many times more people watched Candace Owens or Joe Rogan than CNN or the PBS NewsHour . If conspiracy media get much bigger views than The Atlantic or even The New York Times , they’re the mainstream. The crackpots are the mainstream. And so one of the great unlearnings we have—there is a kind of tepidity, lukewarmness, that pervades what I would call the people who are trying to be honest, and a great passion that animates those who are, either consciously or unwittingly or gullibly, dishonest. So one of the things I think we need to embrace, and this is what I’m trying to do, is an idea—you know, there’s something a little countercultural about what we’re doing. We’re doing what in 1975 would’ve been considered mainstream. We’re fact-checking. We’re running things past lawyers. If we make a mistake, we correct them. Two weeks ago, I made a mistake on air. I said something based on the information we had available at the time about the Bondi Beach killing, that there were eyewitness reports that the police had been slow. And I quoted those, or referenced those. And a week later, when that turned out not to have been correct, I corrected myself. But those habits—we need to understand that those are not the mainstream. The mainstream is paranoia, conspiracy, deception, and it is a countercultural act to stand up for integrity and truth and self-correction. Warzel: I love this because I fully do agree, and I think that this posture of having to apologize because you’re a part of an institution or something like that—I like the idea of reversing that, quite a bit. I think it’s very strong. I think, too—something that I have noticed that has been very, very frustrating to me, and I’ve talked about this on a past episode a little bit, is this idea that so many of the things inside, let’s just call them media institutions or professionalized media, right, that are there in order to build trust among readers and viewers or credibility, right?The idea of fact-checking. The ideas of editing. Those things have been truly weaponized against—something I’ve also found about the right-wing media as it’s built up in the Trump era that’s fascinating, is the absolute lack of editing. You know, they will do livestreams that are, you know, three, four hours long. There’s Joe Rogan’s, not explicitly the right-wing media, but, like, his podcast as a template. You know, those episodes are often three hours–plus long. There’s this idea of no editing, of no fact-checking, of no polish in any sense. And the idea that behind it from them is we’re giving you everything unvarnished. Look at all these other people who are editing things. What are they hiding? Where actually that’s, you know, that’s BS. That’s just quality control. Frum: Not to be pedantic, but this is not a problem just for right-wing media. There are left-wing versions of this. And there will be more. The extreme right got a certain head start. And I think that will not endure if this is the future. You know, one of the things, but you may raise this point, and it makes me think—and this is something that again, that The Atlantic can really contribute. So when modern buildings begin to be constructed in the late 19th century, you start with a steel frame and then you put on around it all this limestone and woodwork, to conceal the steel frame. And the modernist architecture—you know, let’s take all that limestone off and show people the steel frame. We’ll have the steel frame with the glass and they can see the integrity and honesty of the building and realize why the building stands up to all these many stories. I think that’s a little bit the way professionalized media, that’s a good term, responded. The steel frame was the structure of reporting and research and editing and fact-checking and legal checking. And then it was hidden behind the writing. That was the limestone. And maybe we need to take the limestone off and show people a little bit more how the building works and bring people into the process and how we think, why we choose stories the way we do, why we choose not to do certain stories, and how we do our method. Maybe that’s one of the things that we’re doing this very day, to talk a little bit about—you know, every time we invite somebody, we’re making a selection. Who do we choose? Who do we not choose? And in the podcast world, there are people who are, you know, that, well, such and such a person when he or she appeared on such and such a show got so many hits. And this other person who I’m thinking of inviting has never been on a show, or when they were on a show, they got many fewer hits. Nonetheless, I’m going with person No. 2, and maybe I need to talk more with my audience about why I’ve chosen this person who is credible and knowledgeable, and whom I believe has something worth saying and not the other. Warzel: Yeah. This is always the tension here, right? And this is a little bit, too, where I bring the algorithms into play here. I think that the algorithms are optimized for this, like, illiberalism, this sensationalism. And I think right now that is something that is far more prevalent on the right. These algorithms are helping them in an outsized way. So that’s why I don’t always know, when you say we’re gonna be seeing a lot more of this type of content from, you know, from the left. I think that that’s true, that, that the left is going to try to build out an ecosystem like this. But it feels far less like it has a very specific political valence and much more of a valence of a kind of nihilism. And I, and that’s obviously, it can be, you know, just as dangerous as anything. Frum: Well, it’s not nihilism. It’s anti-institutional of a different kind. And one of the things that—when you and I talked in advance about what we were going to do, and I’m showing the cladding, we did talk in advance about what the show would be—some of the lessons we’ve learned from doing this. I’ve tried some things that haven’t worked, and one of the things I’ve learned about this medium is it’s not television. It looks like television, but it’s not. So the way television interviews went or go, to the extent there is still television, is there would be somebody who is important, who had something they didn’t want to say on television, and there would be a professional questioner whose job was to get the person who didn’t want to say the thing to say that thing. And if you watch, like, the Sunday-morning shows, this is the game in its most classic form. And afterwards, the politician can congratulate himself because he went on TV, took 11 minutes of everybody’s time, and said nothing of interest, and that’s a win for him. And I thought, You know what? That doesn’t work anymore. If you don’t want to say something interesting, I don’t know why I’m asking people to spend 11 minutes, or in my case, 40 minutes with you. I’m only going to ask you if you are going to play the game, if you say, You know what? I’m here to communicate. So I’ve learned, invite fewer politicians because they’re still in that mode of the value to them is what they don’t say. And I’ve also sort of stumbled along, and I didn’t intend this, but I don’t know that—there’s a lot of video that is about producing the 92nd clip where the people explode and yell at each other. And if you watch the whole thing, it’s all like a ritualized performance of building up to the moment of confrontation, and the confrontation produces the viral video. And I realized, You know what? I don’t find that tremendously useful either. What I’m increasingly looking for is: People have something they want to say; they agree with me that it should be said. We’re not fighting each other about whether to say it. And we’re also not looking to have a confrontation. We’re looking at this as a kind of cumulative, iterative building process that leaves the user, maybe not shocked at the end, but knowing something more than the user did when the user started. Warzel: This is why I’ve always, in my career, I, rarely—my version of this is rarely wanting to interview CEOs. You have them on the thing. They have everything to lose in this situation. As you said, they’re playing a prevent, defense, they’re running out the clock, whatever you wanna call it, right? Yeah. On the whole interview. I agree with that. One thing I’m curious about, since you have more experience in this realm. Frum: Weeks and weeks of it! Warzel: Weeks, yeah. I know. Hey, on the internet, though, we’re talking dog years here, right? Do you think about the parasocial relationship? Like, are you thinking about building a relationship with audience members, people who are interested in coming for your thoughts, but also just, like, investing in that relationship with them and bringing them into your world, into your mind, into how you think? Do you look at it that way or do you say, Nope, today, like, this is the subject I want people to learn about —a nd I just think about it on that, on that very granular, episodic basis ? Frum: Very much the former, very much the former. Because when I think of this as being countercultural, I’m saying, This is a person you probably have never heard of I’m going to talk to today. But I think they’re important; I think more important, they’re a good-faith actor. So even if we end up having some disagreements, I don’t think they’re going to lie to you. If I did, they wouldn’t be here, and I’m not here to fight with them. People I fight with, I don’t want. This is my actual office. This is where I write. These are my actual books. These are my actual personal souvenirs. If I weren’t doing a show, the souvenirs would be arranged a little differently in the office than they are now. I wouldn’t have them all behind my head where I can’t look at them. I would have them in front of me where I can look at them. Yeah. But they’d still, they’d be in a different location in this actual room. These are my actual paintings on the walls, and the books behind me are not chosen because I’m trying to—they’re not my books or something I’m trying to endorse. My books are arranged by alphabetical order and you’re getting, you know, the m s ’cause we’re in the middle of this. So, and I do try to be quite expressive. I talk about what I think; I talk about the books I’m reading. Because what I have to accept is that the days of Walter Cronkite are gone. The people who are imitating Walter Cronkite don’t have his ethic. The people who are being watched are people who are building relationships. And I think some of these relationships may leap the bound. I mean, I have many relationships that are not—that began as parasocial that are now real. People I may not see very often, but whom I correspond with in a candid way. And I just think that’s the way it’s going to have to be, because we can’t leave the most powerful tools in modern media only in the hands of the devil’s servants. Warzel: I fully agree. I mean, those are my friends there. I mean, it’s a window. It’s a window into this. What I have found as a challenge, though, is trying to play the game a little bit with the platforms while also trying to do what you are talking about, right? Because the game—not only does it reward the sensationalism, all this different stuff; it rewards having people on who have good YouTube channels already. Right? I mean, if you bring on—I brought on my first episode this YouTuber Hank Green, right? And now YouTube allows you to have a little collaboration thing so you guys can share your audiences with each other. And it incentivizes that game of—instead of bringing on the person who no one’s ever heard of, who’s actually way smarter than everyone else here and can give you the conversation that is much more enriching, you have to sort of try to play this game. And similarly, trying to have a conversation about something that people might not think is that interesting—it’s not necessarily going to do as well as, Hold on, let us jump on the Epstein news right after . That is, you know, my most successful episode is chasing the news, is chasing the thing that YouTube’s algorithm already knows is sticky. And I’ve watched—I would love to know if you’ve seen this, because I cover this stuff. I’m really interested in the dynamic, what I call platform dynamics, how the different content spreads around. And I have watched us upload some of these videos to YouTube, and I’ve watched them start to move in a really interesting, like, up into the right direction on the graph and then stall immediately. And it’s, you’re watching an algorithmic—not suppression, because that’s kind of ridiculous to say, but you’re watching something happen, right? It is moving and then it kind of stops. Either it’s reached the audience of people that care in that sense, or—I find that really hard because when we’re talking about trying to do the work that we want to do in this good-faith way, in a way that is hopefully giving people some responsible tools to actually learn about the world in a way that we feel is credible and true, I think it makes me very frustrated to have to work against these powerful other forces that are goading you into being the worst version of yourself. Frum: Well, I share that feeling. It’s true, of course, but you still have to lean against the wind. And one of the things I think a lot about, I don’t want to make this a too-partisan political point, but I’m sorry, I’m going to invoke Trump not to make a point specifically here about him—but I think a lot of people look at the politics of the past decade and say, you know, Above all, it was a giant waste of time. So in 2015, the United States had a series of very serious enduring problems: climate change, we mentioned; public debt; the educational performance of children from the least advantaged backgrounds; the problem of bringing China peacefully into the world of commerce and applauding that they’re raising so many people out of poverty, not letting them push the rest of the world around, but also trying to stay out of a war with them, too; many, many more. And 10 years later, we’ve made zero progress on any of them. It’s just been a giant waste of time. We’re fighting about whether or not one egomaniac actually put his name on the front of the nation’s leading concert hall. What a stupid way for the world’s greatest power to spend a decade. So I think that. But what I also think is this: For those of us who have been through this experience, we’ve made no progress over the past 10 years on these important, enduring chance questions. But we’ve also learned something about defending things that are important. And it’s made many people better people. Many people become better versions of themselves. Many people have discovered things that were important that they didn’t know. And a lot of us have had the experience of saying, you know—I know for myself, I’ll speak very personally. I was on my way out. Out of politics. I had reached a certain age; I’d had certain personal reverses. I wanted out, and it pulled me back. And I’m not entirely happy to be back in that world. But I do have this feeling of, to some, and without being a megalomaniac with this, because it’s very small, but it’s true. If everybody in each of our small degree—we’re needed; we’re doing something that’s needed. And in pushing back against the algorithmic machine on this platform, we’re also doing something that’s needed. And that’s a very valuable human experience. And even if it fails, it’s still valuable. Warzel: I’m just, I’m stuck on the idea of the non-apologetic, countercultural, we-are-the-underdog, in some sense, mentality that you’ve noted here. And just very candidly, it’s very empowering. Because I think that there has been so much apologizing or trying to remain overly deferential to people who are trying to tear the world down because it’s our job to be the rational, cool heads in the room. And I think that coming from the perspective of—these other places are outperforming. They have the bigger audiences—and not trying to take the worst from them, but trying to take that kind of scrappiness, that mantle of being an insurgent, trying to be an insurgent force. And I think that’s really powerful. I would love for more stewards of, let’s call it, again, professional or institutional media to look at it that way, because I think it’s much more hardheaded. It’s much more combative, it’s much more—it feels like it gives a purpose, right? I feel like in the second Trump administration—in the first Trump administration, the media seemed to have a pretty explicit purpose. Let’s shine a light on this thing. Hopefully it will restore the pillars of democracy, or gird everyone, in that way. And I think that there’s been for the most part, broadly, a kind of lost-at-sea nature. Okay, this guy won a second time. What is our function? What do we do? Does what we do have any effect? And I think there’s been this grasping, trying to find the purpose. And I think that that is something of a purpose that people can use, right? Frum: There have been so many human beings in so many historical situations, some of them so much more terrible and dangerous than anything we face—soldiers and seemingly lost causes and metaphorical soldiers and metaphorically seemingly lost causes—who just kept going with one thought: I’m not gonna let the bastards win. And sometimes that’s all you need. Warzel: I think that should be, that should be the new motto, right? Get rid of “Democracy dies in darkness.” “I’m not gonna let the bastards win.” Frum: I. I. Emphasize on the I. And anyone who’s watching, you’re the I. Yeah. One of the things I often point out, if you have one of these [David holds up his smartphone], and we all do, you have more communication power in your hand than Walter Cronkite ever commanded. So we all have to use it wisely. Think about what you share, think about what you trust, think about whom you believe, and encourage others to do the same. And that’s why we’re also gonna encourage you to share what you do believe, which is this program, and Charlie’s, and to join us in being co-publisher because that’s what we all are. We’re all co-publishers. Warzel: And I think, one, I have to say, when this is invoked—you have all that communication power, and one of the best things you can do both for yourself but also for others is to know when not to use it. Yes. To know when to step away from it, you know? Frum: Yes, very true. Warzel: ’Cause that is a huge problem. Frum: Charlie, thanks so much for making the time for me today and congratulations on the new show. We’re co-publishing this. This is an interesting experiment, and may it flourish. Thank you. Warzel: Absolutely. Thank you. [ Music ] Frum: Thanks so much to my Atlantic colleague Charlie Warzel for joining me this week. As I mentioned at the beginning of the show, my book of this week is a history: The Trial of Madame Caillaux . Caillaux, by the way, is spelled C - A - I - L - L - A - U - X for those unfamiliar with the peculiarities of French pronunciation. The Trial of Madame Caillaux was published in 1992. It’s written by the historian Edward Berenson. And it is the story of the most sensational sex and murder trial in pre–World War I France. So I’m going to just take you through the basics of the facts before getting on to why I thought this book was interesting and relevant now. Joseph Caillaux, the husband of Madame Caillaux, was an important politician in pre–World War I France. He was associated with the secular left in the highly complex politics of the Third Republic. At that time, the most important newspaper of the right was a paper called Figaro . Right, in France, means pro-Catholic, pro-militarist. Left means more skeptical of militarism, more secular. Joseph Caillaux, Madame Caillaux’s husband, had led a very checkered life, many affairs with many different women. Although financially, he was quite above board, sexually, he was very public in his flamboyant personal life. Madame Caillaux was his second wife. Both the women he married were divorced women. Figaro went on a campaign against him because of his political views, but they used his personal life. And they got hold of a cache, a group of personal letters that made it clear that Joseph Caillaux and his second wife, Henrietta Caillaux, had started their relationship while Joseph Caillaux was still married to his previous wife and while Henrietta Caillaux was still married to her previous husband. In other words, they hadn’t divorced people and then married. They had started an extramarital affair, then divorced, then remarried. Now, this kind of thing did happen, but it was never to be spoken of, and if it were brought into the light of day, it would be a tremendously shameful thing. And Henrietta Caillaux was indeed shamed. And so one day in March of 1914, she goes to a gun shop, buys a gun, tucks it into her muff, gets in her chauffeur-driven car, goes to the offices of the editor of Le Figaro , waits for him to emerge from his appointment, meets with him, shoots him dead, gets back into a chauffeur-driven car, and drives to the police station. That’s March of 1914. In July, all of this goes on trial in a sensational, sensational case. Now, it’s a case that involves many complex and mysterious attitudes of the time. And this is why I thought it would be interesting to talk about today. Madame Caillaux argues that what happened to her was that she, a mere woman, unable to control her emotions, was so overcome by shame and rage over the exposure of her personal life in the pages of Le Figaro , that as in a kind of mental out-of-control state, a state of total uncontrollable passion, she went to a gun store, bought a gun, drove to the office of Le Figaro , waited for an hour, and shot the editor dead and then drove in the same car to the police station. She just couldn’t control herself. And the jury bought it. The all-male jury bought it. An all-male trial—there was almost no woman present in the courtroom. They bought it, that she was so overcome by her emotions. And so the reason this book is interesting is because, the reason that this trial was worth resurfacing in 1992 was because of what it showed about this very different mentality of a very different time. The prosecution didn’t fight the idea that if a woman were so overcome by emotion, she would be justified in shooting a man dead. Instead, they tried to argue that she had acted in cold blood. In order to make the point that the Caillauxs were not behaving in a proper gendered male-female relationship, one of the things they pointed out was what really should have happened here, what really should have happened was Mr. Caillaux should have challenged the editor of Le Figaro to a duel and fought him instead of letting his wife do his dirty work for him. Somebody should have—no problem with killing somebody or at least attempting to kill them, but it should have been the man, not the woman, who did it. But the woman, because she did it, she was able to fall back on this excuse that she was overcome by passion. Now, as you read this book from this distance in time—and of course, 1992 is now some distance in time as 1992 was from 1914 when all of these events happened—you’re struck by the strangeness and alienness of the mental atmosphere that is described in this trial of a world in which women were regarded as totally the playthings of their emotions, in which male honor required that this kind of private vengeance and that the sin here was not that there was private vengeance, but that the wife did it instead of the husband. And one way you can react to that is by reading the history of this bygone time and saying, Weren’t they foolish? Aren’t we wiser? But another thing that might happen, and this is why I found the book so interesting to read at the turn of the year 2025, is that also looking back at a time where people believed things that we would regard as pretty crazy, pretty irresponsible, pretty wicked, actually—it makes you a little humble and think, What do we believe that is going to look as crazy 100 years from now? Maybe it’s not that they were dumb and we’re smarter. Oh, that’s not impossible; maybe that’s true. But maybe it’s also true: They had a set of delusions that we can see through, and we hold a set of delusions that future generations will see through. Maybe we should have more awareness of the ways in which we might be wrong and understand that it’s precisely those views of which we are most certain—because one thing that everybody in the trial agreed upon was that if you were gripped by overwhelming passion then you were entitled to kill somebody who had insulted you. They all agreed on that. They just disagreed about who should have done it, the husband or the wife. Maybe the things we are most certain about are exactly the things where we are most likely to be led astray. We talked a little bit in our conversation today about the rabbit holes of World War II history. One of the reasons to study history is to study things other than World War II. It’s not just D-Day and Midway all the time. It’s entering into the mentalities of a time that looked pretty close to our own. Pre-1914 France, they had the telephone, they had the motor car—kind of clumsy versions of both, but they had them. They had revolvers, they had the mass press, but they also had ways of thinking that to us seemed completely strange. And how will we look to our grandchildren, and our great-grandchildren? That’s it for this week’s and this year’s edition of The David Frum Show . Happy New Year to all who are observing the passage of time from 2025 to 2026. The show will post on December 31st, but some of you may be watching it in the 250th anniversary year of American independence.

    <summary>Computational review of anion exchange membranes for water electrolysis (green hydrogen) with minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research beyond general water/energy context.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Anion exchange membranes (AEMs) have received a lot of attention in electrochemical energy storage and conversion systems and have become a better choice to generate green hydrogen than their proton exchange membrane counterparts owing to the non-acidic working conditions as well as the use of nonprecious metal catalytic electrodes. Albeit the safe operating conditions as well as the use of non-precious metals, the ion conductivity and technology readiness level of AEMs are significantly lower than their PEM counterparts. It is well accepted that the key factors that drive their performance are anion conductivity, water uptake and chemical stability. However, there exist several other parameters that influence not only the KPI’s but also the overall electrochemical performance of AEMs. The objective of this study is to compile the various physical processes in an anion exchange membrane water electrolyser and focus on the dominant ones that define the performance of these membranes. We further propose appropriate methods to predict the KPIs using multiscale approach. In this report, we elaborately discuss the abovementioned points with a note that, this area still requires substantial research and profound understanding from both experimental and computational point of view. In this article, a comprehensive review on molecular dynamics simulation methods for anion exchange membranes is extensively discussed. We also briefly touch upon the data analytics-based approaches to predict ion conductivity in thesemembranes.

    <title>🔴 ChemRxiv ➤ Oxidation State Determines Solvent Structure Around a Manganese-Vanadium Polyoxometalate Water-Oxidation Catalyst</title>

    <summary>MD and spectroscopy/electrochemistry show that the oxidation state of a Mn–V polyoxometalate water-oxidation catalyst strongly controls microsolvation and aggregation in acetonitrile/water mixtures, impacting activity and stability but only indirectly relevant to origins-of-life chemistry via redox/solvent structuring in water-containing environments.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Understanding how microsolvation influences the reactivity and stability of molecular water-oxidation catalysts remains acentral challenge in artificial photosynthesis. Here, we combine molecular dynamics simulations with spectroscopic andelectrochemical experiments to elucidate how acetonitrile/water mixtures organize around the mixed-valence polyoxometalate[(Mn4O4)(V4O13)(OAc)3]n– across catalytically relevant redox states. Our results reveal a pronounced oxidation-state dependence:the reduced MnV3- species is surrounded by a dense, highly structured hydration shell even at low water contents, preferentiallyengaging terminal vanadate oxygen sites and partially displacing acetonitrile from the first solvation shell. By contrast, the oxidizedMnV2- and MnV1- show substantially weaker water structuring and largely oxidation-state–insensitive acetonitrile organization.These microscopic solvation motifs are directly reflected in experiment: spectroscopic titrations reveal the emergence of hydrogen-Bond formation at V=O groups and Jahn–Teller–driven asymmetric solvent accumulation accompanied by ligand exchange, whileElectrochemical measurements indicate reduced diffusioncoefficients and diminished redox features at higher water contents, consistent with ion-pair–mediated aggregation observed in MD simulations. Together, these results establish oxidation state as a keycontrol parameter for solvent organization around polyoxometallate water-oxidation catalysts and provide a molecular rationalefor the enhanced activity yet limited stability window of MnVn- species in acetonitrile/water mixtures.

    <summary>Demonstrates a practical heat-treatment protocol to preserve urinary proteomes during long-distance transport without cold chain, but it has no meaningful connection to origins-of-life or astrobiology topics.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Biomarkers are measurable changes associated with physiological or pathophysiological processes in the body. Urine, not strictly regulated by homeostatic mechanisms, accumulates extensive variable information and reflects changes in the body earlier and more sensitively, making it an excellent source for biomarker discovery. However, long-distance transport of urine samples usually requires a strictly maintained cold chain throughout the process, resulting in high costs and operational challenges. Here, we propose a urine sample processing method that uses brief heating to inhibit bacterial proliferation and protein degradation. A single urine sample was equally divided into three groups: a pre-heated transport group, a non-heated transport group, and a -80 frozen storage control group, with five replicates in each group. Both the pre-heated and non-heated transport groups were transported simultaneously across northern and southern China for five days under ambient temperature conditions. Samples were analyzed using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that the intra-group overlap rates of identified proteins within the groups treated with 65 water bath heating for 15 minutes and -80 frozen storage were 97.1% and 97.5%, respectively, demonstrating high reproducibility. There were no significant differences in the number or types of urinary proteins identified between these two groups, with an inter-group overlap rate of 99.9%. Additionally, the pre-heated transport group and frozen storage control group showed no significant difference in the number of bacterial-derived peptides and proteins identified. In contrast, significantly more bacterial-derived peptides and proteins were identified in the non-heated transport group than in both the pre-heated transport and frozen storage control groups. This indicates that heating effectively suppresses bacterial counts in urine samples during five days of transport at ambient temperatures. This approach provides a more economical and convenient solution for long-distance transport of urine samples, eliminating the need for cold chain transportation or preservatives. We also recommend using consistent urine processing methods within the same study to minimize technical variability.

    <title>🟠 molecular biology ➤ Evolution tunes functional sub-state interconversion to boost enzyme function</title>

    <summary>This study shows that adaptive evolution can improve enzyme performance by reshaping conformational sub-state interconversion (rather than static structure alone), highlighting dynamic mechanisms by which biological function can diversify under selection.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Enzymes do not operate as static structures, but continuously fluctuate between different conformations. Enzymes therefore dynamically sample conformations with varying catalytic activity. However, it remains largely unexplored whether evolution can exploit the conformational dynamics between sub-states to improve activity. Here, we dissect the evolutionary trajectory of the {beta}-lactamase OXA-48 toward improved ceftazidime hydrolysis. Evolution relieved conformational bottlenecks by promoting alternate functional sub-states, gradually shifting the rate-limiting step from substrate binding to sub-state interconversion, and finally to the chemical step. Reorganization of the conformational landscape enhanced OXA-48&amp;#x27;s ability to hydrolyze ceftazidime and introduced a trade-off in its native activity against meropenem. This trade-off stemmed from catalytic incompatibility between the native and the evolved sub-state populations. Our findings highlight the transitions between functional sub-states as a mechanism of natural selection, shaping functional divergence and offering new strategies for enzyme and antibiotic engineering.

    <summary>Presents a machine-learning-driven computational pipeline to design conserved, high-efficacy CRISPR-Cas13b RNA guides for broad-spectrum targeting of all four Dengue virus serotypes, with limited direct relevance to origins-of-life beyond general nucleic-acid/RNA methodology.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Dengue (DENV), an RNA virus, remains a significant global health threat, particularly in developing regions, with no widely effective antiviral therapy available. The CRISPR-Cas13b system, specifically the PspCas13b subtype, has emerged as a promising programmable antiviral tool capable of targeting viral RNA with high specificity. However, the efficacy of Cas13b-based interventions relies heavily on the design of potent and conserved CRISPR RNA (crRNA) spacer sequences, a task complicated by high viral genetic diversity. Unlike CRISPR-Cas9, which targets double-stranded DNA in eukaryotic genomes, Cas13b directly targets single-stranded RNA, making it ideally suited for RNA virus therapeutics; however, existing computational tools predominantly focus on Cas9 DNA targeting or Cas13d for mammalian transcript knockdown, leaving a significant gap for Cas13b-specific viral antiviral design. In this paper, we propose a computational pipeline and machine learning framework for the rational design of high-efficacy Cas13b guide RNAs targeting all four Dengue serotypes. Our approach integrates large-scale genomic data extraction, conservation analysis, and a novel in silico optimization module for guide RNA (gRNA) sequences, based on recently reported Cas13b design rules (e.g., 5&amp;#x27; GG motif preference, Cytosine penalties). To predict targeting efficiency, we benchmark classical machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) against foundation model-based predictors (Nucleotide Transformer, RNA-FM) using a dataset of experimentally validated spacers. Our results demonstrate that classical feature-engineered models significantly outperform deep learning approaches when trained on experimentally validated gRNA datasets in low-data regimes. We identify highly conserved, optimized crRNA candidates, including several pan-serotype guides with predicted high potency. This work establishes a baseline for Cas13b efficiency prediction and provides a robust computational resource for accelerating the development of CRISPR-based antivirals against Dengue and other RNA viruses.

    <summary>Cell biology study showing that mitochondrial proton motive force collapse stabilizes the vitamin B12 chaperone MMADHC in the cytosol, boosting B12-dependent methionine synthase (MTR) activity and linking mitochondrial energetics to one‑carbon metabolism.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Of the ~1100 mitochondrial proteins, only a handful like PINK1 and ATFS-1 are known to stabilize and relocalize upon collapse of the proton motive force (PMF) to execute signaling roles. To systematically identify genes that increase exclusively at the protein level upon PMF collapse, we performed a joint proteomic and RNA-seq screen. The screen revealed 10 candidates (six mitochondrial), including the vitamin B12 chaperone MMADHC and cytosolic B12-dependent methionine synthase (MTR). MMADHC is short-lived across cell types and we show that its levels increase with PMF collapse. MMADHC stabilization precedes PINK1 activation in a time course of increasing mtDNA depletion, suggesting greater sensitivity to PMF collapse. MMADHC accumulates in mitochondria with LONP1 inhibition but in the cytosol upon PMF collapse, likely due to mitochondrial import failure. Cytosol-stabilized MMADHC increases MTR levels and activity. Altogether, the mitochondrial PMF regulates the cytosolic B12-dependent MTR, integral to one-carbon metabolism, by controlling the stability and compartmentalization of the B12 chaperone MMADHC.

    <summary>Uses information geometry and Fisher information “sloppiness” analysis on single-cell RNA-seq to show cell state transitions are constrained to low-dimensional manifolds with fluctuating stiff/sloppy parameter directions, offering a quantitative framework for cellular dynamical control rather than a direct origins-of-life study.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Single-cell dynamics during cell state transitions are highly confined, ensuring precise control. This confinement can be described using low-dimensional manifolds. Leveraging information geometry, we developed a method to quantify cell state transition manifolds using single-cell RNA sequencing data. With this approach, each single cell is represented as a multivariate Gaussian distribution and is associated with a Fisher information matrix. We analyzed variations in the Fisher information matrix and its eigenvalue spectrum during cell state transitions. Our results reveal pronounced sloppiness in single cells, where cell state is sensitive to only a few specific combinations of parameters. Importantly, the degree of sloppiness fluctuates during cell state transitions. We found that critical transitions are associated with changes in the so-called stiff parameters. Notably, parameters identified as stiff exhibit low velocities and minimal fluctuations, whereas sloppy parameters display higher velocities and larger fluctuations. These findings indicate that cells fine-tune sensitive directions with caution while permitting greater flexibility along sloppy directions, revealing a principle of least action confining the paths taken during state transitions. During transitional stages, fluctuations and velocities increase were observed on stiff parameters, reflecting enhanced dynamical activity as cells navigate through critical regions of the manifold. Thus, we propose a new framework for analyzing single-cell dynamics. The low dimensionality of cell state transitions is characterized through sloppiness analysis, while changes in the Fisher information spectrum reveal shifts in cell dynamic modes.

    <summary>A cultural essay recommending books about clubbing and nightlife history, with no connection to origins of life, astrobiology, or related prebiotic chemistry topics.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    There are nights when the dance floor beckons but the bones refuse. When the urge to party arrives, it may be too late to book a babysitter. Perhaps you’re already in sweatpants, or closing time is before midnight where you live. Possibly, the prospect of going out has been raised but vetoed by a cohabitant, and you don’t want to tango alone. You could also be the kind of person who is more interested in the idea than the reality of loud, sweaty, euphoric congresses found in clubs and music venues. Fortunately, mood-altering substances are available at home—by which, of course, I mean books. A rich literature on pleasure-oriented nightlife is available for consultation or consolation on your evening in. These five books offer a bit of vicarious sweat and thrill to get you as close to the experience as possible without demanding that you leave your couch. They also invite readers to think more expansively about what exactly draws so many people to mingle in the dark—the club’s human stakes, its sensory pleasures, and its illuminating social history. Reading a good book is not the same as riding a social high into the wee hours, but it may equip you with a sense of possibility that you can apply far beyond the coatroom. On the right night, wise women attest , a DJ can save your life. The Haçienda: How Not to Run a Club , by Peter Hook The Haçienda in Manchester was a catalyst of the U.K. acid house scene in the late ’80s, and a prophecy foretold: “The h açienda must be built,” the Situationist poet Ivan Chtcheglov wrote in 1953. Heeding these cryptic words some three decades later, the audacious (and well-read) impresario Tony Wilson opened the Haçienda together with the circle of post-punk musicians and designers involved with his label, Factory Records. Their attempt to decipher Chtcheglov’s mystical phrase lasted 15 years. Hook, the bassist for New Order, served as a kind of player-coach at the Haçienda, helping manage its madcap affairs while his band became the club’s cash cow. In this memoir of misbegotten business administration, Hook returns to the storied nights out that changed British culture even as they threatened to bankrupt him—and worse. Beset by gangs and guns, the Haçienda faltered in the ’90s despite clever-sounding schemes such as replacing the club’s security with the gangsters themselves. This is a scrapbook of utopian folly, yes, but also an insider’s look at what was, for a time, the wildest workplace on Earth. Love Saves the Day: A History of American Dance Music Culture, 1970–1979 , by Tim Lawrence “Disco sucks” was the cry of philistines, if not bigots, Lawrence argues. In this meticulous but inviting cultural history of New York nightlife in the 1970s, he follows disco’s rise from underground clubs such as the Loft to the vaunted lights of Studio 54 and the FM airwaves of American suburbs. Versions of this story have been told before, but what distinguishes Love Saves the Day are the more than 300 interviews Lawrence conducted with promoters, partiers, and legendary DJs such as Frankie Knuckles . It’s full of wisdom from the elders of American club culture: how to stagger straight and gay crowds on a Friday night, how to find the next great floor-filling single, how to build a DJ set like a furnace that can burn all night. Lawrence also folds in a number of select club “discographies” so you can reproduce Jimmy Stuard’s set from 12 West, circa 1976, at home (on nice speakers, perhaps, or an iPhone placed in a cereal bowl). [ Read: Partying feels different now ] Bright Lights, Big City , by Jay McInerney Some might say McInerney’s debut novel reads a bit long in the tooth four decades after it first offered the curious public a glimpse of Manhattan-yuppie hedonism. Still, no syllabus on clubbing could be complete without the opening chapter’s rendering of the dislocation and dread that may await the partygoer “on that imperceptible pivot where two A.M. changes to six A.M.” For the nameless protagonist—a young fact-checker recently separated from his wife—a punishing club itinerary provides the opposite of community and connection. Something important is being avoided, in fact, on the dance floor and in the many crowded bathroom stalls where lines of “Bolivian Marching Powder” are hungrily apportioned. Beyond its glitz and sleaze, Bright Lights is a sobering lesson on why partying does not always soothe a troubled soul. Legendary: Inside the House Ballroom Scene , by Gerard H. Gaskin One of the older photographs in Gaskin’s book, from 1998, finds an impeccably suited ballroom performer strutting the boards of what appears to be a community-center gymnasium. Scanning from head to toe, the viewer sees a banded fedora, cigar, jacket and trousers, and, finally, holding it all up (easily missed at first glance): vertiginously high stilettos. It’s an image of heroic poise, accentuated by the look of enchantment on the faces of a trio of young men watching from folding chairs. Gaskin has long enjoyed a reputation as the “Trinidadian Andy Warhol” of the ballroom scene in New York City, writes the scholar Frank Roberts, a subject of Gaskin’s; for those who performed in that world between the mid-1990s and the early 2010s, when these photos were taken, appearing in a Gaskin portrait was a “rite of passage.” His pictures illustrate the drama and grandeur of these events, but they also convey the importance of the club as a place where dignity—elsewhere denied—may be claimed without apology, and freedom can be realized for the length of the catwalk. [ Read: The coronavirus is testing queer culture ] Raving , by McKenzie Wark Wark’s sprawling intelligence is a pleasure to access on any subject. In Raving , Wark blends autofiction and theory to chaperone the reader through the trans rave scene in New York City—or at least the scene as she found it in the years before and after 2020. “First thing I look for at raves: who needs it,” she writes of these parties, “and among those who need it, who can handle their habit?” Vividly told, Raving is no gawking ethnography; it’s a sticky and tender little book with serious ethical contemplation at its center. Wark is attentive to the essence of raving as a Black art form and its special significance for queer people, but she approaches it as an activity open to anyone who can handle it—not a way of life so much as a way of creating new lives together.

    Entropy, Vol. 28, Pages 55: The KPZ Equation of Kinetic Interface Roughening: A Variational Perspective Entropy doi: 10.3390/e28010055 Authors: Horacio S. Wio Roberto R. Deza Jorge A. Revelli Rafael Gallego Reinaldo García-García Miguel A. Rodríguez Interfaces of rather different natures&amp;amp;mdash;as, e.g., bacterial colony or forest fire boundaries, or semiconductor layers grown by different methods (MBE, sputtering, etc.)&amp;amp;mdash;are self-affine fractals, and feature scaling with universal exponents (depending on the substrate&amp;amp;rsquo;s dimensionality d and global topology, as well as on the driving randomness&amp;amp;rsquo; spatial and temporal correlations but not on the underlying mechanisms). Adding lateral growth as an essential (non-equilibrium) ingredient to the known equilibrium ones (randomness and interface relaxation), the Kardar&amp;amp;ndash;Parisi&amp;amp;ndash;Zhang (KPZ) equation succeeded in finding (via the dynamic renormalization group) the correct exponents for flat d=1 substrates and (spatially and temporally) uncorrelated randomness. It is this interplay which gives rise to the unique, non-Gaussian scaling properties characteristic of the specific, universal type of non-equilibrium roughening. Later on, the asymptotic statistics of process h(x) fluctuations in the scaling regime was also analytically found for d=1 substrates. For d&amp;amp;gt;1 substrates, however, one has to rely on numerical simulations. Here we review a variational approach that allows for analytical progress regardless of substrate dimensionality. After reviewing our previous numerical results in d=1, 2, and 3 on the time evolution of one of the functionals&amp;amp;mdash;which we call the non-equilibrium potential (NEP)&amp;amp;mdash;as well as its scaling behavior with the nonlinearity parameter &amp;amp;lambda;, we discuss the stochastic thermodynamics of the roughening process and the memory of process h(x) in KPZ and in the related Golubovi&amp;amp;#263;&amp;amp;ndash;Bruinsma (GB) model, providing numerical evidence for the significant dependence on initial conditions of the NEP&amp;amp;rsquo;s asymptotic behavior in both models. Finally, we highlight some open questions.

    <summary>CRISPR-engineered human stem cell–derived islets show that a protective IFIH1 (MDA5) truncation variant dampens dsRNA-driven interferon responses, reducing stress, apoptosis, and dysfunction under viral and inflammatory challenges in a type 1 diabetes background.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked dozens of genetic loci to type 1 diabetes (T1D). The IFIH1 gene, which encodes the double-stranded RNA sensor MDA5, is one such locus. The E627* single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in IFIH1 is associated with protection against T1D, while the A946T variant is linked to increased risk. While the E627* variant has been shown to result in a truncated protein and dampen type I interferon (IFN) signaling, its specific role in human pancreatic islet health and function remains unclear. We hypothesized that MDA5627* would protect islet cells from stress-induced dysfunction, identity loss, and cell death. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we introduced the E627* and A946T variants into human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) derived from a T1D patient. We differentiated these hPSCs into stem cell-derived islets (SC-islets) and treated them with IFN, poly(I:C), and coxsackievirus B3, an enterovirus implicated in T1D pathogenesis. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and an array of functional assays, we investigated the variant impact on both whole SC-islets and their individual cell populations. Our analysis revealed that SC-islets, and their {beta}, , and {delta} cell subpopulations, harboring the MDA5627* variant exhibit an attenuated immune response to the various stressors compared to MDA5946T cells. We also report unique, cell-type-specific transcriptional responses that vary across variants. Notably, MDA5627* SC-islets showed reduced apoptosis rates and viral genome expression, as well as attenuated negative effects on mitochondrial function and insulin secretion in response to stress. Overall, our findings demonstrate that a clinically relevant MDA5 variant confers protection by dampening stress-mediated transcriptional responses, reducing cell dysfunction, and preventing apoptosis. These insights provide a mechanistic framework for understanding T1D pathogenesis and offer new avenues for developing preventative therapies.

    Environmental change doesn’t affect evolution in a single, predictable way. In large-scale computer simulations, scientists discovered that some fluctuating conditions help populations evolve higher fitness, while others slow or even derail progress. Two populations facing different kinds of change can end up on completely different evolutionary paths. The findings challenge the idea that one population’s response can represent a whole species.

    <summary>A bibliometric analysis using OpenAlex metadata finds near-universal growth in journal internationalization and shifting foci in multidisciplinary journals over the last century, offering meta-level context for how interdisciplinary fields like origins-of-life research may evolve.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    There is a widely held perception that science is becoming more international—through multi-national collaborations—and interdisciplinary, drawing on knowledge from multiple domains. However, these hypothesized trends have not yet been quantitatively characterized. With the publication metadata from OpenAlex, we examine trends in two groups of journals: disciplinary journals in natural sciences, life sciences, social sciences, and multidisciplinary journals that publish articles in multiple fields. Supporting existing perceptions, we find an almost universal trend towards increasing internationalization of both sets of journals. Nevertheless, we find disparities: medicine journals are less international than journals in other disciplines and do not increase their levels of internationalization, whereas physics journals appear to be segregating between those that are international and those that are not. We also find that multidisciplinary journals have undergone significant shifts in their disciplinary focuses over the past century, whereas disciplinary journals appear to have largely maintained their degree of interdisciplinarity.

    <summary>Develops an automated, hierarchical Life Identification Number (LIN) code system based on core-genome MLST to robustly name and compare highly recombining Neisseria gonorrhoeae lineages for surveillance and antibiotic-resistance epidemiology.</summary>

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Investigation of the bacterial pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae is complicated by extensive horizontal gene transfer: a process which disrupts phylogenetic signals and impedes our understanding of population structure. The ability to consistently identify N. gonorrhoeae lineages is important for surveillance of this increasingly antimicrobial resistant organism, facilitating efficient communication regarding its epidemiology; however, conventional typing systems fail to reflect N. gonorrhoeae strain taxonomy in a reliable and stable manner. Here, a N. gonorrhoeae genomic lineage nomenclature, based on the barcoding system of Life Identification Number (LIN) codes, was developed using a refined 1430 core gene MLST (cgMLST). This hierarchical LIN code nomenclature conveys lineage information at multiple levels of resolution within one code, enabling it to provide immediate context to an isolate’s ancestry, and to relate to familiar, previously used typing schemes such as Ng cgMLST v1, 7-locus MLST, or NG-STAR clonal complex (CC). Clustering with LIN codes accurately reflects gonococcal diversity and population structure, providing insight into associations between genotype and phenotype for traits such as antibiotic resistance. These codes are automatically assigned and publicly accessible via the https://pubmlst.org/organisms/neisseria-spp database.

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Scientists in China have performed an experiment first proposed by Albert Einstein almost a century ago when he sought to disprove the quantum mechanical principle of complementarity put forth by Niels Bohr and his school of physicists. Bohr claimed there are properties of particles that cannot simultaneously be measured. The new result backs up the Copenhagen school yet again, with the potential to shed light on other, less settled questions in quantum mechanics.

    <summary>Single-cell RNA splicing analysis reveals coordinated, conserved aging-associated splicing programs in mouse and human tissues, implicating Snrnp70 and an age-dependent SRSF5 splice-site shift as markers of a conserved &#39;youth&#39; program.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Alternative splicing is a key gene regulatory process that diversifies the proteome and controls gene dosage. Previous studies have detected aging-associated splicing changes across various tissues. However, their use of bulk RNA-seq obfuscates the impacted cell-types and may confound cell-type proportion changes with cell-intrinsic ones. We present a framework that first assembles and maps alternative splicing events in appropriate single cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq), then applies LeafletFA, a probabilistic model that discovers coordinated splicing programs (SPs) without requiring prior knowledge of cell types or clinical information, such as age. Applying this framework to over 200,000 cells from mouse and human Smart-seq2 multi-tissue atlases, we discovered global and cell type specific aging-associated SPs. In mice, integrating SPs with gene expression significantly improved age prediction in 46 of 76 tissue-cell types tested. We identified the RNA-binding protein textit{Snrnp70} as a key upstream mediator driving the shift from youthful to aged SPs. To test evolutionary conservation of these patterns, we employed transfer learning to map the murine splicing dictionary onto human transcriptomes. This revealed a conserved &amp;quot;youth&amp;quot; program (SP4) that is maintained in quiescent endothelial tissues but lost in high-turnover organs. We identified a conserved, age-dependent alternative 5&amp;#x27; splice site usage in the splicing factor textit{SRSF5} as a molecular marker of this program in both species. Our work establishes alternative splicing as a coordinated, evolutionarily conserved dimension of cellular aging and provides LeafletFA as an open-source tool for single-cell splicing analysis.

    <summary>A narrative cultural-history essay about the Soviet-era reinvention of New Year’s as a secular Christmas analogue and how that tradition is changing across the post-Soviet diaspora.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Every year in late December, my childhood home transformed into a vision of American bliss. We’d gather to ornament a tree, drape string lights around the house, and sit down to an elaborate feast. Not long after dawn the next day, while our little sister still slept, my brother and I would impatiently sneak downstairs to see our gifts, which we understood to have been delivered by a kindly old man. It could have been a scene out of A Christmas Story . Except we weren’t celebrating Christmas. My family was celebrating the Soviet version of New Year’s, a holiday that resembles Christmas in nearly every way, except that it takes place almost a week later and excludes Jesus, God, or any other signifier of religion. We were keeping the national tradition alive in suburban America, years after the country that invented it had dissolved. Soviet New Year’s began as a ritual in a country where all the religious rituals were gone. Long before the 1917 revolution that brought them to power, the leaders of the Soviet Union had decried religion as, in Karl Marx’s phrase, the opium of the masses. Their officially atheist government suppressed many kinds of spiritual observance, including Christmas. But by the mid-1930s, Soviet leaders sensed that people needed something to take the edge off in the dead of winter, a carnivalesque custom of the sort that Christmas once provided. So they took the most fun parts of the Christian holiday and plopped them on New Year’s. It became arguably the most important holiday on the country’s calendar. Other celebrations tended to come with historical significance, such as the anniversary of the revolution and of the Soviets’ victory in World War II. But New Year’s, at its core, was about nothing more and nothing less than family: a chance to come together and take stock. That may be a big reason it survived the Union’s dissolution. Even after religious institutions were allowed to conduct their services without government interference and their holidays were acknowledged, New Year’s remained important for both the people who had left the region and those who still lived there. But today, Soviet New Year’s customs are in danger of slipping away or evolving beyond recognition. Some people still celebrate the holiday the old way, with their families and gifts. Many, though, are establishing new practices that reflect new values and new political circumstances: Wars between former Soviet republics, for instance, and the ways that political leaders have used the momentous nature of the night for their own gains, have changed how people celebrate. A holiday that once felt embedded in the identity and culture of the Soviet people may soon become untethered from its history. Soviet New Year’s began at a time when morale in the country was, in general, low. It was the 1930s, and Ukraine had suffered one of the worst man-made famines in world history. The idea to bring joy to the winter came from a Communist Party leader named Pavel Postyshev, who had been one of the famine’s administrators. During an intimate car ride around Moscow with General Secretary Joseph Stalin and a future successor, Nikita Khrushchev, Postyshev proposed reviving the tradition of trees, but tied to a secular holiday. Stalin enthusiastically endorsed the idea, and in 1935, a letter from Postyshev appeared in Pravda , the official newspaper of the party’s central committee, arguing that all Soviet children should get to experience the cheer that the bourgeoisie’s children once had: “Let’s organize a fun New Year’s Eve party for the kids.” Postyshev’s idea spread like a wildfire in reverse—trees sprang up across the Soviet Union. The first year, delegates from the local party leadership and schoolteachers gathered parents and instructed them in how to decorate a tree. In some schools, Grandfather Frost, a Santa Claus equivalent, distributed gifts to kids. Soon, families adopted the new practice as their own. But Postyshev never got to see the extent of it. In the ’30s, Stalin consolidated power, punishing anyone he suspected of opposing him, including Postyshev—who was executed in 1939. The holiday soon became another tool for Stalin to reinforce his power and centrality in Soviet life. “The cheerful, happy children sang, danced, recited poems, praising in the songs and poems of their beloved Stalin, who gave them a joyful and happy life,” one 1938 newspaper report read. [ Read: Understanding Stalin ] After Stalin died, in 1953, the holiday’s focus turned away from politics. In 1956, Khrushchev delivered a speech criticizing Stalin’s “cult of personality” and his purges, signaling to people that they could drop the anxieties about political correctness that had constricted their lives in the Stalin era. The film Carnival Night , released that same year, captured the iconoclastic mood. In it, workers resist the efforts of their company director to organize a New Year’s celebration in which everything is acceptable to the people above him and no fun for those below. He plans to deliver a speech, but a worker persuades a magician to make the text disappear; when the director later goes to grab it, he instead finds a string of scarves and other knickknacks. The company director, representing a self-aggrandizing political blowhard, is humiliatingly sidelined, and the workers have a grand time. By the time my dad started celebrating New Year’s in Moscow, in the ’60s, most of the elements of the holiday I would come to know as a kid were present: family dinner, gifts, and a decorated tree. It had become an unquestioned fulcrum of Soviet life. If there was a custom of reading poems or singing songs in Khrushchev’s honor, it wasn’t ubiquitous. Once the country’s leaders began giving an annual New Year’s address, in 1970, these speeches weren’t taken seriously. They were filled with empty platitudes, “void of meaning,” according to The Invention of Russia , by the journalist Arkady Ostrovsky . “These addresses were merely a prompt for popping the corks from bottles.” That cork-popping continued even as the Soviet Union dissolved and many people left the region. I was born in Moscow in 1996, five years after the fall of the Union, and we moved to upstate New York five years after that. For a long time, the New Year’s my family celebrated was stuck in amber, the old tree-and-gifts version. In the former Soviet republics, people still considered the day significant but changed some of the customs. In Armenia, for instance, once religious holidays were again allowed, religious institutions attached themselves to New Year’s. From the early 1990s until 2023, the head of the national Church would deliver a midnight address right before the country’s president or prime minister. Tigran Simyan, a professor at Yerevan State University who studies the evolution of New Year’s in Armenia and the post-Soviet world, told me, “Our happy New Year, for us, is more important than Christmas.” [ Read: When the Soviets voted ] Politics also returned to the holiday after the Soviet Union’s fall. In Russia, the seeming end of single-party rule and a brief moment of political competition revived the status of the New Year’s address. It was a rare time when all eyes were focused on the same speaker. The Russian Federation’s first president, Boris Yeltsin, strategically resigned on December 31, 1999, giving his handpicked successor, Vladimir Putin, the opportunity to introduce himself during a midnight address as the millennium turned. “The ritual was unmistakably staged,” Ostrovsky writes in The Invention of Russia . “The New Year’s address had greater symbolic value than any election.” In more recent times, young Russians have tended to focus on partying on New Year’s Eve. But the many people who maintain the Soviet way of celebrating at home with family might still put on Putin’s address. Once again, a popular film captures the mood. The plot of 2010’s Yolki is almost the exact opposite of Carnival Night ’s. Whereas the 1956 film is about a collaborative effort to prevent a speech, Yolki features people across the country working together to help a girl on her quixotic quest to insert a phrase into the president’s midnight address, granting the address central importance. Yolki was the first in what became Russia’s most financially successful non-animated film franchise, despite the series’ declining artistic and entertainment value. Its 12th sequel, set as ever on New Year’s Eve, came out this December. Eventually, politics’ creep back into the New Year’s holiday began to affect the way my family celebrated in the United States. Although for years, none of us took what Putin said in his address too seriously, my grandparents still put it on out of habit. But as his regime grew more repressive and violent, we let that go. The way I remember it, we stopped after Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine, in 2014, deciding that we didn’t need to support Putin’s rule on our holiday. But my dad dates our move away from the midnight address to earlier, in 2012. That year, Putin stepped through a loophole in constitutional term limits and returned to the presidency , then brutally suppressed the protests that followed. “I didn’t want to hear him anymore,” my dad told me recently. After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine , in February 2022, some Ukrainians’ New Year’s celebrations stopped. “What is there to celebrate when there is a war?” a Ukrainian soldier serving on the front line asked Euronews last New Year’s. Meanwhile, I spent last New Year’s in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, where clubs had just been closed for weeks in deference to protests over the government pausing its European Union accession bid. Though some young people I talked with were spending the night with their family, many spilled out onto Rustaveli Avenue in the city center for a combination party, protest, and celebration. Without a single state to hold it together, and so many interstate conflicts, the Soviet New Year’s tradition is splintering across the Soviet diaspora. [ Read: What I learned from the Georgia protests ] Perhaps soon the holiday will become unrecognizable from its former iteration, especially as the people who remember its origins adapt to new cultures or pass away. My own family no longer makes a point of gathering on the holiday. In part, that’s because my siblings and I have gotten older, scattered, and given in to assimilationist pressure—the fear of missing out on the American custom of partying with our friends on New Year’s. But we’ve also lost the center of gravity that held us to the Soviet tradition. Early in November, my last surviving grandmother suffered a stroke, which paralyzed most of her body, leaving only her eyes and one arm fully mobile. Her grandfather, my great-great-grandfather, became a Bolshevik in 1905 and participated in the three revolutions that led to the establishment of the Soviet Union. His son, her father, wrote and disseminated anti-religious propaganda. Much of my family’s adherence to the holiday might very well be because of this history. On Thanksgiving, days before my grandmother died, I told her I was researching our holiday tradition. She squeezed my hand and blinked knowingly. Watching the tradition slip away feels like losing part of the Soviet and post-Soviet identity that’s defined my family for more than a century. I feel a grief that’s hard to disentangle from my grief for the people who passed the tradition on to me. But looking back on how my family has acted in decisive moments, I’m also aware of an opportunity. My forefathers helped form the Soviet identity and its rituals, even before there was a country to promote them. Likewise, during and after the Soviet Union’s existence, although politicians repeatedly imposed a tone that fit their priorities, my family chose how to spend the day. Ultimately, the common people reshaped the holiday to suit their needs and values. Their examples prove that people can make their own traditions, with whatever ideals they inherit. ​​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

    <summary>Bioinformatics, simulations, and fluorescence spectroscopy suggest class II fungal peroxidases evolved reduced tryptophan-to-heme FRET to favor long-range electron transfer from lignin substrates, improving lignin degradation efficiency.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    A key step in the evolution of lignin-degrading enzymes is revealed by the observation that, unlike other heme-proteins studied to date, Class II peroxidases exhibit minimal energy transfer from tryptophan (Trp) to heme residues. Bioinformatics analyses and molecular dynamics simulations of Class II (MnP and VP) and Class III (horseradish peroxidase, HrP) structures indicate that the Trp residue in HrP has the highest orientational factor and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency. By contrast, Trp residues in MnP and VP display low FRET efficiency due to unfavorable orientation factors despite their proximity to the heme. Steady-state fluorescence experiments confirmed this low FRET efficiency, showing strong emission in MnP and VP but weak emission in HrP. This decreased Trp-to-heme energy transfer appears to minimize competition between direct FRET and long-range electron transfer (LRET), allowing electrons to flow from bulky lignin substrates to the heme center. Such a mechanism likely provided a selective advantage during the evolution of Class II peroxidases, facilitating efficient lignin degradation at the enzyme surface.

    <summary>Reports a one-step synthesis of trehalose-capped atomically precise Au25 nanoclusters with noted chirality and enhanced thiourea-triggered antimicrobial activity in water, offering limited indirect relevance to origins-of-life topics beyond aqueous stability and chirality.</summary>

    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    The ability to synthesize well-defined atomically precise nanoclusters is important both in advancing fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships of nanomaterials and for materials, energy, and biomedical applications. Nonetheless, incorporating bioactive ligands into the nanoclusters poses a significant challenge, possibly due to complex metallophilic interactions and incompatibility with typical synthetic conditions. In this work, we developed a straightforward method for the synthesis of an atomically precise gold nanocluster capped with a carbohydrate ligand, trehalose, Au25Tre18, in one step and in 55% yield. The formation of the nanocluster was enabled by using a mild reducing agent, t-butylamine borane, in a biphasic condition. The structure was confirmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry, optical absorption spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). 2D DOSY NMR gave a diffusion coefficient of 1.93 × 10-10 m2s-1 and the hydrodynamic diameter of 1.88 nm for Au25Tre18. The CD spectrum of Au25SG18 indicated chirality, having features differing from other chiral Au25 nanoclusters. The aqueous solution of is stable at elevated temperatures, e.g., 80 oC. In a thiourea (TU)-triggered release assay, Au25Tre18 exhibited enhanced antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis, showing a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) four times lower than that of its analogous nanocluster capped with glutathione, Au25SG18. Treating the bacteria at 1×MIC of Au25Tre18/TU resulted in complete eradication of bacteria, whereas bacteria treated with Au25SG18/TU at the same concentration continued to grow.

    <summary>Using spectroscopic probes and ML-aided simulations, this study shows that constrained hydrogen-bond network growth in water/HFIP strengthens H-bonding and measurably tunes acidity, offering broadly relevant physico-chemical insight for how microenvironments could modulate prebiotic reaction conditions.</summary>

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    The reactivity of hydrogen bond networks (HBNs) is critical to many chemical and biological scenarios. When the HBNs are under constraint, hydrogen bond strength and acidity are affected significantly. HBNs exhibit cooperativity, where connections formed in one part of the HBN influence its behavior elsewhere. We combined experimental and computational approaches to examine the growth of the HBNs of water and hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), constrained by an aprotic cosolvent. We independently employed vibrational frequency shift of an acetonitrile probe, 1H NMR chemical shift of an aniline probe, and molecular dynamics with machine learning interatomic potentials, to demonstrate the increase in the hydrogen bond strength with the growth of the HBNs. Finally, using vibrational spectroscopy of a titratable probe, we established that not only the hydrogen bond strength, but also the acidity of HFIP is affected by the changes in the network geometry. These results enable the engineering and measurement of HBNs in confined environments with tailored acidity.

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Large-scale single-cell CRISPR screens with single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) readouts provide critical data to map causal gene regulatory networks (GRNs). However, translating the complex scRNA-seq outputs into reliable causal insights remains a major analytical challenge. Here we present CausalGRN, a scalable computational framework that infers causal GRNs and predicts cellular responses to unseen perturbations. CausalGRN first mitigates pervasive spurious partial correlations in sparse scRNA-seq data through a novel adaptive thresholding correction, enabling robust inference of an undirected graph. It then orients this graph using observed perturbation outcomes. The resulting directed GRN can be used to predict the downstream effects of novel perturbations via network propagation. Across both simulations and diverse experimental datasets, CausalGRN substantially outperforms existing approaches in network reconstruction accuracy and in predicting the effects of unseen perturbations, providing a principled bridge from perturbation data to causal gene regulation.

    <summary>This paper focuses on hybrid quantum-classical methods for covalent drug inhibitor discovery in human health and does not address origins-of-life, prebiotic chemistry, habitability, or astrobiology themes.</summary>

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    We describe a collaborative research project spanning the disciplines of quantum hardware, quantum algorithms, conventional computational chemistry, synthetic medicinal chemistry and life sciences. Our project seeks to demonstrate an impact of quantum computing on human health. It is one of several funded by Wellcome Leap as part of their Quantum for Bio Program. We aim to use quantum computing to guide the discovery of covalent inhibitors for the treatment of the rare disease myotonic dystrophy type I. Modelling the formation of a chemical bond in the context of the rest of the inhibitor and the protein is a challenge, because of the size of the systems of interest, the intricacies of the electronic structure where the importance of electron correlation may vary between reactant and transition states, and the extensive sampling of configurational space that is often required. We are developing an efficient hybrid quantum-classical framework to address the accuracy and scalability limitations of conventional computational drug design approaches. A quantum-enhanced density functional approximation is developed based on data from computation on neutral-atom quantum hardware, which can then be deployed within conventional quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations. Our quantum-enhanced framework can be systematically updated as more capable quantum processors become available, heralding the prospect of using quantum-derived data to train improved density functional approximations and, ultimately, to support a wide range of drug design efforts.

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Self-assembling 3D DNA crystals, composed of a repeating lattice of 3D DNA tiles, have emerged as a powerful technique in the field of materials synthesis. Porous DNA crystals have been used for diffraction studies, electronics, and drug loading, but stability in complex biological media, and the development of responsive cargo deposition has yet to be realized. In this paper, we engineer DNA crystals using the tensegrity triangles that exhibit tunable mesoporous properties, nuclease resistance, stimuli-responsive small molecule release through coating the inner lattice with amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC). We demonstrate a general method for varying degrees of calcification, and we characterize the morphology the ensuing ACC material through polarized optical microscopy and Raman microscopy. These calcified crystals are further characterized by producing molecular structures of the underlying DNA lattice via X-ray diffraction and Ca phasing. We show the resistance of calcified crystals to degradation by serum nuclease. By studying the deintercalation and intercalation of ethidium bromide as a drug analog, we confirm that calcium carbonate addition allows for tunable pore-size to enable selective drug-release. We anticipate this work will serve as a foundation for studies on the targeted binding and release of small molecules to enable smart medical nanomaterials and drug delivery systems.

    <summary>Computational chemistry study showing HF-DFT accuracy for halogen/chalcogen-bond interaction energies largely arises from functional–density error cancellation, offering methodological insights (with minor relevance to modeling water and other weak interactions) but no direct origins-of-life focus.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Unusually large energy errors of semi-local density functional approximations (DFAs) for molecules are often strongly reduced by using the Hartree–Fock (HF) electron density instead of the self-consistent DFA density. For reaction barriers and water clusters, some of us earlier found that HF-DFT succeeds not because the HF density is accurate, but due to cancellation of negative functional-driven error (FE) by positive density-driven error (DE). Since DE, as defined here, is biased toward the self-consistent DFA density and against the HF density, the DE of the HF density is referred to as non-variational density over-localization (NVDO). In this work, we show that interaction energy errors in halogen- and chalcogen-bonded complexes in the B30 data set are not dominated by density-driven error. Instead, HF-DFT again succeeds through FE–DE cancellation. Benchmark Kohn–Sham inversions of coupled-cluster densities for NH3…ClF, Cl-…ClF, Cl-…SF2, Cl-...SCF2, and Cl-…PF3 provide strong evidence for this cancellation. For additional complexes, we employ the long-range-corrected hybrid LCωPBE as a proxy for electron-transfer errors in the exact density. We also examine several self-interaction correction (SIC) methods and find significant improvement from FLOSIC. We point out common features of the density errors in the NH3…ClF, Cl-…ClF complexes and three transition states, arguing that significant density-driven errors of energy arise only from electron-transfer errors. We also highlight a common feature in our present and previous work: long bonds can lead to non-negligible functional-driven self-interaction error of the energy from otherwise-accurate semi-local functionals in transition states, water clusters, and halogen or chalcogen bonds.

    <summary>Introduces sub-ångström liquid-phase 3D electron diffraction to solve in situ crystal structures and phase transformations (e.g., glycine and an aluminum–glycine hydrate) directly in aqueous liquids, a broadly enabling method for studying prebiotic-relevant crystallization and molecular organization.</summary>

    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Atomic-scale insights into phase transitions and structural dynamics of crystals in liquids are fundamental for understanding chemical, physical, and biological processes. Liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy (LP-TEM) platform integrates diffraction, imaging, and spectroscopy and has opened new opportunities to study nanoscale materials in liquid environments. Yet, atomic-scale electron crystallographic analysis of crystals in liquids remains elusive. Here, we establish sub-ångström liquid-phase three-dimensional electron diffraction (LP-3D ED) for capturing phase transformation and determining atomic crystal structures in situ by exploiting nanochannel liquid cells. The well-defined and ultrathin liquid layers confined within the nanochannels enable the acquisition of 3D ED data at 0.80 Å resolution from organic molecular crystals in liquids at room temperature. Using LP-3D ED combined with liquid flow control, we observe the β-to-α phase transformation of glycine and in situ crystallization of a novel hydrated aluminum-glycine phase in aqueous solution in the nanochannels. We demonstrate ab initio crystal structure determination at sub-ångström resolution by LP-3D ED, and identify a novel hexanuclear aluminum-hydroxide-glycine cluster in the in situ formed aluminum-glycine phase. This work demonstrates the capability of LP-3D ED to probe structural evolution and to reveal solvated crystal structures of nano- and microcrystals directly in liquid environments.

Evening Read Jan Buchczik New Year’s Resolutions That Will Actually Lead to Happiness By Arthur C. Brooks If you are someone who follows a traditional religion, you most likely have a day such as Yom Kippur, Ashura, or Ash Wednesday, dedicated to atoning for your sins and vowing to make improvements to your life. But if you are not religious, you might still practice a day of devotion and ritualistic vows of self-improvement each year on January 1. New Year’s Day rings in the month of January, dedicated by the ancient Romans to their god Janus. Religious Romans promised the two-faced god that they would be better in the new year than they had been in the past. According to the Pew Research Center , historically between one-third and one-half of Americans observe this pagan rite every year by making their own New Year’s resolutions. The most common resolutions are fairly predictable : financial resolutions, like saving more money or paying down debt (51 percent in 2019); eating healthier (51 percent); exercising more (50 percent); and losing weight (42 percent). Old Janus is pretty annoyed at this point, I imagine, because our resolutions overwhelmingly fail. Read the full article. Culture Break (Illustration by Shawna X) Watch.

    <summary>Cryo-EM structures of a circularly permuted group II intron reveal how active-site rearrangements switch self-splicing from branching to water-driven hydrolysis, informing the evolution and mechanistic flexibility of ancient RNA catalysis relevant to origins-of-life models.</summary>

    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Group II introns are self-splicing ribozymes that are considered the ancestors of the eukaryotic spliceosome. Unlike canonical group II introns that self-splice to generate linear exons and lariats, circularly permuted (CP) group II introns identified in various bacterial phyla perform back-splicing, resulting in the production of circular RNAs and branched products via branching pathway. Furthermore, CP introns may switch to a hydrolysis pathway resulting in distinct products to differentially regulate gene expression. In this study, we present biochemical data and high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of a CP group II intron from Comamonas testosteroni KF-1 (Cte 1), allowing mechanistic dissection of the branching pathway switch to the hydrolysis pathway and enabling reconstruction of both both steps of the hydrolysis pathway. The structures reveal that CP undergoes the hydrolysis pathway upon mutations of the branch point or splice sites (SS) due to rearrangements in the active site. Here, the branching nucleotide in domain D6 is retracted from its catalytically competent conformation, giving way to the nucleophilic water molecule to attack the 5&amp;#x27; splice site. Furthermore, we visualized the intermediates of the second splicing step, which reveal the movement of domain D6 out of the way for the 3&amp;#x27;-splicing to occur, closely resembling the second-step structures of the branching pathway. Finally, our structures provide direct evidence for domains D1D2D3 acting as a scaffold in group II introns.Together, these findings visualize the complete hydrolysis pathway and offer a new strategy to engineer CP introns for circular RNA production, with potential applications in both basic research and therapeutic development.

    Previously, we showed that the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein explores a wide range of biophysical properties facilitated by non-local impact of point mutations to its intrinsically disordered regions (Nguyen et al., 2024). This includes modulation of self-association, such as the creation of a de novo binding interface through the P13L mutation characteristic of Omicron variants. In the present work, we focus on the key function of N condensing viral RNA into ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) for viral assembly. Lacking high-resolution structural information, biochemical and biophysical approaches have revealed architectural principles of RNPs, which involve cooperative interactions of several protein-protein and protein-RNA interfaces, initiated through oligomerization of conserved transient helices in the central disordered linker of N. Here, we study the impact of defining N-protein mutations in variants of concern on RNP formation, using biophysical tools, a virus-like particle assay, and reverse genetics experiments. We find convergent evolution in repeated, independent introduction of amino acid substitutions strengthening existing binding interfaces, compensating for other substitutions that promote viral replication but decrease RNP stability. Furthermore, we show that the P13L mutation of Omicron variants enhances RNP assembly and increases viral fitness. Overall, our data reveal RNP complexes to be highly variable not only in sequence and conformations but also in thermodynamic and kinetic stability, with its pleomorphism affecting basic architectural principles. We hypothesize that the formation of polydisperse, fuzzy N-RNA clusters with multiple distributed weak binding interfaces optimizes reversible RNA condensation, while supporting host adaptation and allowing for a large sequence space to be explored.

    A spectacular fossil trove on the Arctic island of Spitsbergen shows that marine life made a stunning comeback after Earth’s greatest extinction. Tens of thousands of fossils reveal fully aquatic reptiles and complex food chains thriving just three million years later. Some predators grew over five meters long, challenging the idea of a slow, step-by-step recovery. The find rewrites the early history of ocean ecosystems.

    <summary>A population-genetics study of local adaptation and origin/sex-dependent dispersal fitness in wild Atlantic salmon, with no direct relevance to origins-of-life or astrobiology.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Local adaptation is often portrayed as uniform fitness disadvantages of immigrants relative to residents. Yet dispersal costs vary with origin, sex, and life-history traits, shaping the balance between gene flow and adaptation. We quantified these heterogeneous costs by comparing the reproductive success of local and immigrant individuals using a 15-year genetic pedigree of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), including over 1,100 adults and 3,400 juveniles. Immigrants represented 19.5% of adults, showed male-biased dispersal, and averaged 15% lower reproductive success than locals. However, outcomes were strongly origin-dependent: immigrants from some populations suffered severe fitness costs while others matched or exceeded locals. Sex and life-history further modulated reproductive success: male immigrants underperformed local males, whereas multi-sea-winter females often equaled or outperformed female residents. Immigrant males partially compensated their fitness offset by acquiring more mates. These findings highlight that, while local adaptation promotes philopatry, immigrants origin effects should be considered in gene-flow adaptation dynamics.

    <summary>Engineering study optimizing standardized isothermal heat-transfer tests for refrigerated containers (ATP Treaty), with no direct connection to origins-of-life, astrobiology, or prebiotic chemistry.</summary>

    Entropy, Vol. 28, Pages 47: Optimizing ATP Isothermal Tests: A Theoretical and Experimental Approach Entropy doi: 10.3390/e28010047 Authors: Juan P. Martínez-Val Piera Alberto Ramos Millán The International Agreement on the Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs and on the Special Equipment to Be Used for Such Carriage (usually known as ATP Treaty) defines a standardized isothermal test for qualifying refrigerated containers, but its current protocol is lengthy, costly and lacks scientific justification. This paper presents a combined theoretical and experimental study aimed at optimizing this procedure. First, a heat-transfer framework based on transient conduction and thermal diffusivity is developed to estimate stabilization times using dimensionless criteria. Then, extensive experimental tests on ATP containers validate these predictions and reveal additional phenomena such as air leakage and chimney effects. Based on these findings, a revised protocol is proposed that reduces the test duration from more than 18 h to approximately 2 h while preserving the thermal stabilization conditions required by ATP. Experimental results show that the uncertainty in the determination of the global heat-transfer coefficient K is reduced from about 2&amp;amp;ndash;2.3% in the classical ATP procedure to roughly 0.7&amp;amp;ndash;1.0% with the new protocol. In addition, the method suppresses secondary physical effects&amp;amp;mdash;such as chimney-driven air leakage and latent-heat losses due to water evaporation&amp;amp;mdash;thus improving the physical representativeness of the measured K value. The proposed accelerated protocol offers a scientifically grounded, cost-effective alternative for future ATP standards.

    <summary>Develops a Transformer-based multimodal framework to score individual cfDNA molecules for cancer screening by fusing methylation, fragmentomics, and histone-mark features—highly relevant to biomedical diagnostics but only tangentially connected to origins-of-life via general DNA/nucleic-acid methodology.</summary>

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) serves as a non-invasive biomarker for cancer detection, but conventional methods face challenges due to the ultra-low abundance of tumor-derived cfDNA (ctDNA) among normal cfDNA. Though nucleosome-bound cfDNA harbors rich epigenomic features that could enable ctDNA identification by single-molecule multi-omics cross-validation, this remains unexplored due to methodological limits. Here, we developed a cfDNA sequencing approach integrating methylation, fragmentomics, and histone modifications at the single-molecule level; together with gene semantics and epigenomic annotations, these modalities were vectorized and fused to represent each cfDNA molecule. We trained a Transformer-based model (cfAI) to profile and evaluate ctDNA likelihood at molecule, gene, and sample levels. cfAI achieved ~10-fold enrichment of cancer-derived signals over noise and reached 72.6% sensitivity at 93.1% specificity for multi-cancer detection. Our study establishes an innovative framework that overcomes the inherent signal-to-noise limitations of conventional assays and reveals biological features at molecular resolution for cancer detection.

    <summary>A large-scale comparative genomics study mapping Z-DNA/Z-RNA-forming sequences across 281k genomes, finding pervasive enrichment in cellular life but strong lineage-specific depletion in influenza viruses consistent with evolutionary pressure from host sensing pathways.</summary>

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Z-DNA/Z-RNA is an alternative left-handed nucleic acid conformation with established and emerging roles in gene regulation, immunity, and genome instability. However, its occurrence dynamics and lineage specificity across the tree of life have not yet been fully characterized. Utilizing the recently developed and improved Z-DNA searching tool, ZSeeker, we analyzed 281,139 complete organismal genomes, including multiple Telomere-to-Telomere genome assemblies, and generated genome-wide Z-nucleic acid maps, examined their topography, and compared them to dinucleotide-preserving controls. Cellular genomes featured pervasive Z-DNA enrichment relative to expectation, with enrichments of ~1.5 and ~1.7-fold in Bacteria and Archaea and ~3-fold in Eukaryota. In contrast, Viruses exhibited large differences between lineages, with modest enrichment in several DNA viral groups and pronounced depletion across RNA clades, most notably Influenza A/B strains. We built a LASSO regression model trained on non-Influenza viruses (cross-validated R2 {approx} 0.73), which identified GC content, genome type, and host type as the leading predictors for Z-nucleic acid density, yet it significantly over-predicted Z-RNA density in Influenza A/B. More than 99% of assemblies exceeded the +2 SD threshold, and a &amp;quot;typical Influenza&amp;quot; genome was predicted at 2.76 bp/kb compared to ~0.016 bp/kb observed (a ~170-fold overestimation based on chance alone). Together, these results reveal domain- and lineage-specific regimes: cellular genomes are enriched for Z-DNA consistent with regulatory roles, whereas influenza viruses appear to have undergone strong, lineage-specific depletion of Z-RNA-forming sequences, likely reflecting evolutionary pressure tied to host sensing pathways.

    <summary>An essay-style overview of how cloud distributions regulate planetary temperature and light, offering general habitability context but no direct origins-of-life or astrobiology mechanisms.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    As a scholar researching clouds, I have spent much of my time trying to understand the economy of the sky. Not the weather reports showing scudding rainclouds, but the deeper logic of cloud movements, their distributions and densities and the way they intervene in light, regulate temperatures and choreograph heat flows across our restless planet.
