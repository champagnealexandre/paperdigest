    In case you’re settling into winter and lamenting not having read everything The Atlantic has published this year, you’re in luck. I’ve created a list of stories you may have missed that are very much worth your time. The assortment ranges widely: eating an organ feast in Mark Twain’s Paris, experiencing a comedy-show adventure in Riyadh, drifting after a shipwreck in the Pacific, and diving into the secrets of the Inca empire. “What Parents of Boys Should Know” sparked many conversations in my group chats, as did this photo of Abraham Lincoln’s ear being cleaned. There are stories that contextualized a chaotic moment for the American experiment, drawing deeply on history. I hope you’ll spend time with this selection, and I would love to hear what you think. Send me a note: btharoor@theatlantic.com . I Watched Stand-Up in Saudi Arabia By Helen Lewis What the surreal Riyadh Comedy Festival foretold about the kingdom’s future The New Rasputins By Anne Applebaum Anti-science mysticism is enabling autocracy around the globe. America and Its Universities Need a New Social Contract By Danielle Allen Fifty dollars for STEM, five cents for citizenship—that’s how America apportions its education dollars. Our beleaguered universities must redress the balance—helping the country and themselves. What Parents of Boys Should Know By Joshua Coleman Daughters tend to receive higher levels of affection and patience at home than sons. But the sons might need it more. Is This the Worst-Ever Era of American Pop Culture? By Spencer Kornhaber An emerging critical consensus argues that we’ve entered a cultural dark age. I’m not so sure. My Shipwreck Story By Alec Frydman On my first time out as a commercial fisherman, my boat sank, my captain died, and I was left adrift and alone in the Pacific. An Innocent Abroad in Mark Twain’s Paris By Caity Weaver My quest for a true literary experience resulted in choucroute , a surprise organ feast, an epiphany at the Louvre, existential dread, and a rowboat. A PTSD Therapy “Seemed Too Good to Be True” By Yasmin Tayag What if overcoming trauma can be painless? What the Founders Would Say Now By Fintan O’Toole They might be surprised that the republic exists at all. Invisible Habits Are Driving Your Life By Shayla Love The science of habits reveals that they can be hidden to us and unresponsive to our desires.

The Man in the Midnight-Blue Six-Ply Italian-Milled Wool Suit By Gary Shteyngart A perfect suit, made by an expert tailor out of superlative fabric, would do nothing less than transform me. The New Authoritarianism By Steven Levitsky This isn’t single-party rule, but it’s not democracy either. Turtleboy Will Not Be Stopped By Chris Heath A profane blogger believes an innocent woman is being framed for murder. He’ll do anything to prove he’s right—and terrorize anyone who says he’s wrong. The Rise of the Brown v. Board of Education Skeptics By Justin Driver Why some mainstream Black intellectuals are giving up on the landmark decision The Internet’s Favorite Sex Researcher By Helen Lewis How Aella went from selling sex to studying it The Telepathy Trap By Daniel Engber A podcast shows how love divides us.

When Adoption Promises Are Broken By Nicole Chung Many birth mothers hope to maintain contact with their child. But their agreements with adoptive parents can be fragile. Evening Read Jan Buchczik New Year’s Resolutions That Will Actually Lead to Happiness By Arthur C. Brooks If you are someone who follows a traditional religion, you most likely have a day such as Yom Kippur, Ashura, or Ash Wednesday, dedicated to atoning for your sins and vowing to make improvements to your life. But if you are not religious, you might still practice a day of devotion and ritualistic vows of self-improvement each year on January 1. New Year’s Day rings in the month of January, dedicated by the ancient Romans to their god Janus. Religious Romans promised the two-faced god that they would be better in the new year than they had been in the past. According to the Pew Research Center , historically between one-third and one-half of Americans observe this pagan rite every year by making their own New Year’s resolutions. The most common resolutions are fairly predictable : financial resolutions, like saving more money or paying down debt (51 percent in 2019); eating healthier (51 percent); exercising more (50 percent); and losing weight (42 percent). Old Janus is pretty annoyed at this point, I imagine, because our resolutions overwhelmingly fail. Read the full article. Culture Break (Illustration by Shawna X) Watch.

    <title>🟡 biophysics ➤ Structural basis for hydrolytic splicing of a circularly permuted group II intron</title>

    <summary>High-resolution cryo-EM and biochemistry reveal how a circularly permuted group II intron switches from branching to hydrolysis via active-site rearrangements, illuminating ribozyme catalysis and RNA-based evolutionary mechanisms relevant to RNA-world discussions.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Abstract:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
    Group II introns are self-splicing ribozymes that are considered the ancestors of the eukaryotic spliceosome. Unlike canonical group II introns that self-splice to generate linear exons and lariats, circularly permuted (CP) group II introns identified in various bacterial phyla perform back-splicing, resulting in the production of circular RNAs and branched products via branching pathway. Furthermore, CP introns may switch to a hydrolysis pathway resulting in distinct products to differentially regulate gene expression. In this study, we present biochemical data and high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of a CP group II intron from Comamonas testosteroni KF-1 (Cte 1), allowing mechanistic dissection of the branching pathway switch to the hydrolysis pathway and enabling reconstruction of both both steps of the hydrolysis pathway. The structures reveal that CP undergoes the hydrolysis pathway upon mutations of the branch point or splice sites (SS) due to rearrangements in the active site. Here, the branching nucleotide in domain D6 is retracted from its catalytically competent conformation, giving way to the nucleophilic water molecule to attack the 5&amp;amp;#x27; splice site. Furthermore, we visualized the intermediates of the second splicing step, which reveal the movement of domain D6 out of the way for the 3&amp;amp;#x27;-splicing to occur, closely resembling the second-step structures of the branching pathway. Finally, our structures provide direct evidence for domains D1D2D3 acting as a scaffold in group II introns.Together, these findings visualize the complete hydrolysis pathway and offer a new strategy to engineer CP introns for circular RNA production, with potential applications in both basic research and therapeutic development.

    <title>🟠 eLife ➤ Evolution of a fuzzy ribonucleoprotein complex in viral assembly</title>

    <summary>Using SARS‑CoV‑2 nucleocapsid variants, the study shows convergent evolution toward stronger, distributed weak N–RNA/protein interfaces that tune assembly of pleomorphic (“fuzzy”) ribonucleoprotein condensates, offering general insight into how simple RNA–protein self-assembly can be optimized by evolution.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Abstract:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
    Previously, we showed that the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein explores a wide range of biophysical properties facilitated by non-local impact of point mutations to its intrinsically disordered regions (Nguyen et al., 2024). This includes modulation of self-association, such as the creation of a de novo binding interface through the P13L mutation characteristic of Omicron variants. In the present work, we focus on the key function of N condensing viral RNA into ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) for viral assembly. Lacking high-resolution structural information, biochemical and biophysical approaches have revealed architectural principles of RNPs, which involve cooperative interactions of several protein-protein and protein-RNA interfaces, initiated through oligomerization of conserved transient helices in the central disordered linker of N. Here, we study the impact of defining N-protein mutations in variants of concern on RNP formation, using biophysical tools, a virus-like particle assay, and reverse genetics experiments. We find convergent evolution in repeated, independent introduction of amino acid substitutions strengthening existing binding interfaces, compensating for other substitutions that promote viral replication but decrease RNP stability. Furthermore, we show that the P13L mutation of Omicron variants enhances RNP assembly and increases viral fitness. Overall, our data reveal RNP complexes to be highly variable not only in sequence and conformations but also in thermodynamic and kinetic stability, with its pleomorphism affecting basic architectural principles. We hypothesize that the formation of polydisperse, fuzzy N-RNA clusters with multiple distributed weak binding interfaces optimizes reversible RNA condensation, while supporting host adaptation and allowing for a large sequence space to be explored.

    <summary>Large-scale comparative genomics across 281k genomes shows pervasive enrichment of Z-DNA in cellular life but striking lineage-specific depletion of Z-RNA-forming motifs in influenza viruses, implying strong evolutionary constraints on alternative nucleic acid conformations.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Abstract:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
    Z-DNA/Z-RNA is an alternative left-handed nucleic acid conformation with established and emerging roles in gene regulation, immunity, and genome instability. However, its occurrence dynamics and lineage specificity across the tree of life have not yet been fully characterized. Utilizing the recently developed and improved Z-DNA searching tool, ZSeeker, we analyzed 281,139 complete organismal genomes, including multiple Telomere-to-Telomere genome assemblies, and generated genome-wide Z-nucleic acid maps, examined their topography, and compared them to dinucleotide-preserving controls. Cellular genomes featured pervasive Z-DNA enrichment relative to expectation, with enrichments of ~1.5 and ~1.7-fold in Bacteria and Archaea and ~3-fold in Eukaryota. In contrast, Viruses exhibited large differences between lineages, with modest enrichment in several DNA viral groups and pronounced depletion across RNA clades, most notably Influenza A/B strains. We built a LASSO regression model trained on non-Influenza viruses (cross-validated R2 {approx} 0.73), which identified GC content, genome type, and host type as the leading predictors for Z-nucleic acid density, yet it significantly over-predicted Z-RNA density in Influenza A/B. More than 99% of assemblies exceeded the +2 SD threshold, and a &amp;amp;quot;typical Influenza&amp;amp;quot; genome was predicted at 2.76 bp/kb compared to ~0.016 bp/kb observed (a ~170-fold overestimation based on chance alone). Together, these results reveal domain- and lineage-specific regimes: cellular genomes are enriched for Z-DNA consistent with regulatory roles, whereas influenza viruses appear to have undergone strong, lineage-specific depletion of Z-RNA-forming sequences, likely reflecting evolutionary pressure tied to host sensing pathways.

    <summary>A Science report on rapid marine ecosystem recovery just ~3 million years after the end-Permian mass extinction, offering broad astrobiology-relevant context on biosphere resilience but not directly addressing origins-of-life mechanisms.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Abstract:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
    A spectacular fossil trove on the Arctic island of Spitsbergen shows that marine life made a stunning comeback after Earth’s greatest extinction. Tens of thousands of fossils reveal fully aquatic reptiles and complex food chains thriving just three million years later. Some predators grew over five meters long, challenging the idea of a slow, step-by-step recovery. The find rewrites the early history of ocean ecosystems.

    Entropy, Vol. 28, Pages 47: Optimizing ATP Isothermal Tests: A Theoretical and Experimental Approach Entropy doi: 10.3390/e28010047 Authors: Juan P. Martínez-Val Piera Alberto Ramos Millán The International Agreement on the Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs and on the Special Equipment to Be Used for Such Carriage (usually known as ATP Treaty) defines a standardized isothermal test for qualifying refrigerated containers, but its current protocol is lengthy, costly and lacks scientific justification. This paper presents a combined theoretical and experimental study aimed at optimizing this procedure. First, a heat-transfer framework based on transient conduction and thermal diffusivity is developed to estimate stabilization times using dimensionless criteria. Then, extensive experimental tests on ATP containers validate these predictions and reveal additional phenomena such as air leakage and chimney effects. Based on these findings, a revised protocol is proposed that reduces the test duration from more than 18 h to approximately 2 h while preserving the thermal stabilization conditions required by ATP. Experimental results show that the uncertainty in the determination of the global heat-transfer coefficient K is reduced from about 2&amp;amp;amp;ndash;2.3% in the classical ATP procedure to roughly 0.7&amp;amp;amp;ndash;1.0% with the new protocol. In addition, the method suppresses secondary physical effects&amp;amp;amp;mdash;such as chimney-driven air leakage and latent-heat losses due to water evaporation&amp;amp;amp;mdash;thus improving the physical representativeness of the measured K value. The proposed accelerated protocol offers a scientifically grounded, cost-effective alternative for future ATP standards.

    <summary>Develops a Transformer-based multimodal AI method to profile single-molecule cfDNA (methylation, fragmentomics, histone marks) for improved cancer screening, with minimal relevance to origins-of-life beyond general DNA-related methodology.</summary>

    &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Abstract:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
    Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) serves as a non-invasive biomarker for cancer detection, but conventional methods face challenges due to the ultra-low abundance of tumor-derived cfDNA (ctDNA) among normal cfDNA. Though nucleosome-bound cfDNA harbors rich epigenomic features that could enable ctDNA identification by single-molecule multi-omics cross-validation, this remains unexplored due to methodological limits. Here, we developed a cfDNA sequencing approach integrating methylation, fragmentomics, and histone modifications at the single-molecule level; together with gene semantics and epigenomic annotations, these modalities were vectorized and fused to represent each cfDNA molecule. We trained a Transformer-based model (cfAI) to profile and evaluate ctDNA likelihood at molecule, gene, and sample levels. cfAI achieved ~10-fold enrichment of cancer-derived signals over noise and reached 72.6% sensitivity at 93.1% specificity for multi-cancer detection. Our study establishes an innovative framework that overcomes the inherent signal-to-noise limitations of conventional assays and reveals biological features at molecular resolution for cancer detection.

    <summary>Using a 15-year genetic pedigree of Atlantic salmon, the study shows immigrant reproductive success is generally lower than locals but varies strongly with population of origin, sex, and life-history, highlighting heterogeneous dispersal costs in local adaptation.</summary>

    Local adaptation is often portrayed as uniform fitness disadvantages of immigrants relative to residents. Yet dispersal costs vary with origin, sex, and life-history traits, shaping the balance between gene flow and adaptation. We quantified these heterogeneous costs by comparing the reproductive success of local and immigrant individuals using a 15-year genetic pedigree of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), including over 1,100 adults and 3,400 juveniles. Immigrants represented 19.5% of adults, showed male-biased dispersal, and averaged 15% lower reproductive success than locals. However, outcomes were strongly origin-dependent: immigrants from some populations suffered severe fitness costs while others matched or exceeded locals. Sex and life-history further modulated reproductive success: male immigrants underperformed local males, whereas multi-sea-winter females often equaled or outperformed female residents. Immigrant males partially compensated their fitness offset by acquiring more mates. These findings highlight that, while local adaptation promotes philopatry, immigrants origin effects should be considered in gene-flow adaptation dynamics.

    <summary>Presents a machine-learning framework (GRAIL) to generate plausible intermediate single-cell transcriptomic states between observed developmental stages, with minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life or astrobiology.</summary>

    &amp;lt;hr/&amp;gt;
    &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Abstract:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;
    The primary challenge in cellular dynamics is to capture the intermediate states between two distinct biological stages. This is because of the technical constraints in capturing transient states or the nature of single-cell sequencing protocols. To address this challenge, we introduce a new computational framework, GRAIL (Generative Reconstruction of Artificial Intermediate Lineages), which aims to bridge these missing transitions. GRAIL reconstructs biologically plausible intermediate cell states between two distinct developmental stages (A and B) through a Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) based cell selection strategy followed by a smooth interpolation in learned latent space. The interpolated latent representations are subsequently decoded into gene expression profiles using a trained generator from a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The framework consists of three components: (a) a pretrained autoencoder that learns latent representations of stage specific transcriptomes, (b) an LSH-guided interpolation procedure that identifies anchor cells and performed interpolation in latent space, and (c) a GAN generator that extrapolates realistic intermediate expression from the interpolated samples consistent with the underlying trajectory. We benchmarked GRAIL with different state-of-the-arts (SOTA) in diverse setup of simulated dataets as well as in real life scRNA-seq datasets. Generated samples from GRAIL preserve expected marker gene expression patterns and also improve downstream analyses, including differential expression and cell clustering. Our method addresses the critical gap in studying cellular transitions when experimental intermediate samples are unavailable.
