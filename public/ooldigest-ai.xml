<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein cages are a versatile platform capable of encapsulating a wide range of nanoparticle cargo within biocompatible protein shells while providing tunable functionalities. Here, we investigated a self-assembly system that forms vesicle-like protein cages while simultaneously encapsulating nanoparticles at high density, yielding pomegranate-like protein-nanoparticle hybrid materials. Amphiphilic recombinant fusion protein building blocks based on elastin-like polypeptides, leucin zippers, and fluorescent proteins were employed to assemble vesicle-like protein cages via temperature-triggered liquid-liquid phase separation in the presence of fluorescent polystyrene nanoparticles. Analysis of nanoparticle encapsulation density and protein cage size indicates cooperative interactions between protein building blocks and nanoparticles that mediate the formation of protein-nanoparticle coacervate intermediates, which subsequently convert into core-shell hybrid protein cages, as further supported by kinetics studies. We demonstrate the self-assembly hybrid protein cages incorporating a fluorescent calcium sensor protein and titanium oxide nanoparticles, which exhibit a drastic enhancement in their calcium capability as a result of nanoparticle encapsulation. This platform offers a broadly applicable strategy that integrates protein biofunctionality with diverse nanoparticle properties for the development of advanced hybrid materials.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Inter-individual variability is often treated as noise, yet its temporal evolution can reveal regulatory mechanisms hidden from mean behavior. We present a stochastic framework that exploits fluctuations to infer regulatory mechanisms in cell population dynamics. Focusing on adult neural stem cells, we build a state-dependent stochastic model of transitions between quiescent and active states and derive a diffusion approximation for mean and variance trajectories of observable quantities. Applied to longitudinal data from wild-type and interferon-receptor knockout mice, we show that distinct mechanisms produce similar mean dynamics but different fluctuation patterns. Fitting both mean and variance dynamics reveals proliferation-rate regulation as the dominant driver of fluctuation amplitude, while activation and self-renewal mainly shape mean behavior and long-term fate. In wild-type mice all three processes are regulated, but knockout mice lose activation control. This demonstrates that stochastic variability is a valuable source of mechanistic information beyond average dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Presents a transformer model (EpiTADformer) that uses high-resolution epigenomic signals to improve prediction of human TAD boundaries beyond Hi-C resolution, with minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research aside from general DNA/genome context.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The human genome is partitioned at different levels of 3D genome organization, with topologically associating domains (TADs) being among the most well-known and biologically important structures. TAD boundary disruption is associated with a wide range of diseases such as cancer, neurological and developmental disorders. Numerous methods have been developed to detect TAD boundaries from chromatin contact maps obtained with Hi-C technology. However, these methods are largely limited by the resolution of Hi-C data, typically 1 Kb to 100 Kb. In contrast, functional DNA loci, collectively referred to as epigenomic data, are profiled at a much higher resolution (100-200 bp for a typical ChIP-seq experiment). To improve the resolution of boundary detection, we hypothesize that the patterns of epigenomic signals associated with regions in proximity to TAD boundaries can serve as embeddings for these genomic regions, defining region similarity. These embeddings, along with their positional relationships, can be effectively modeled using deep learning to achieve more precise boundary prediction. We present EpiTADformer, a transformer-based model that takes as input transcriptional and histone modification signals of neighboring regions centered around TAD boundaries. We demonstrate that EpiTADformer outperforms feedforward neural network, convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) network architectures. These results suggest the positional information of epigenomic signals surrounding TAD boundaries provides a strong predictive signal, enabling improved performance of the transformer model. Our findings highlight the potential of epigenomic signals to serve as region embeddings for refining the epigenomic language of TAD domains and 3D genome organization.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Being the basic building blocks of chromatin, nucleosomes and their stability determine the genome accessibility for different DNA-dependent proteins. This characteristic is labile under all cell-life processes. One of the abundant DNA-binding proteins, which is important for genome compaction, is poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase1 (PARP1). Despite the extensive experimental data on the chromatin compaction regulation under ADP-ribosylation, the details of the interplay of nucleosome with PARP1 in the absence of protein activation remain unclear. In this study, we analyzed the changes in the nucleosome wrapping upon PARP1 interaction using a single-molecule approach - optical tweezers. We demonstrate that PARP1 binding leads to weakening of the contacts that support the nucleosome core.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The escalating crisis of antimicrobial resistance poses a devastating and immediate threat to human life. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising antibiotic substitute to combat antimicrobial resistance. Compared with the traditional wet-lab screening approaches, computational models have largely improved the efficiency of predicting antimicrobial peptide. However, most computational models overlook or underutilize the evolution and structural information of peptides, which is crucial for understanding the peptide functions. Here, we proposed a sophisticated deep learning model to predict AMPs, Antimicrobial Peptide Bilinear Attention Network (AMPBAN), which incorporates peptide evolution features from ESM3 protein language model, structure features from ESMFold predicted with equivariant graph neural network (EGNN), and the joint information from sequence and structure learned via Bilinear Attention Network. AMPBAN consistently demonstrated superior accuracy and generalization compared to nine state-of-the-art AMP prediction models across multiple independent benchmarks. Furthermore, an ablation study confirms that our multimodal fusion strategy significantly refines the integration of sequence and structural signals, yielding superior predictive balance over single-modality models. This framework provides a robust tool for the accelerated discovery of novel AMPs and the advancement of next-generation antimicrobial drug development. The datasets, source code and models are available at https://github.com/baiwenhuim/ampban.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Preprint introduces TRAMA, an ARG-based statistical method to infer tandem repeat mutation models (SMM vs TPM) and estimate mutation parameters, advancing population-genetic modeling but with only indirect relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tandem Repeats (TRs) have complex mutational patterns that depend on many properties of the analyzed loci. An accurate characterization of the mutation model that defines the evolution of each TR is fundamental to understand the genetic diversity patterns of each TR. Here we propose a computational method that leverages the rich information contained in the ancestral recombination graph (ARG) to estimate the mutation process that drives the evolution of one loci containing a TR variant. Our method is called TRAMA, Tandem Repeat ARG-based Mutation Analysis. TRAMA uses the genealogical history estimated at each loci, which is contained in the ARG, to estimate the parameters that define the mutation of a TR under two different mutational models: The Stepwise Mutation Model (SMM) and the Two-Phase Mutation Model (TPM). First we show that TRAMA can provide estimates of the mutation rate of a TR evolving under the SMM that are accurate or have a slight underestimation when the mutation rate is higher than 10-5. Then, we show that TRAMA can provide reasonable estimates of the parameters that define the TPM under certain conditions. We also show that TRAMA can do an accurate selection of the mutational model that better explains the genetic diversity patterns of a loci from two competing models: TPM and SMM. Then, we show that estimates of the mutation rate under the SMM are similar when using the true genealogical history compared to using a genealogical history estimated using an ARG inference program, SINGER. We also discuss potential extensions of our methodology to perform a more accurate characterization of the mutation model driving the evolution of TRs.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces SigDyn, a framework to infer single-cell mutational signature dynamics and tumor phylogenies from scRNA-seq, revealing treatment- and DNA-repair–linked mutational processes during cancer evolution.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: Cancer is driven by mutations that confer tumor cells proliferation advantages but also vulnerabilities with therapeutic potential. Underlying tumor progression are mutational processes that imprint signatures of co-occurring mutation types in tumor cell genomes. The discovery of signatures and their etiologies offers insight into disease mechanisms and treatment opportunities, however acquisition of mutations by tumor cells over time leads to intratumor heterogeneity that may challenge treatment efficacy. Understanding which mutational processes contribute to the evolution of each tumor can reveal therapeutic strategies, but it requires single-cell mutational signature analysis, which remains unexplored. Results: We present SigDyn, a framework enabling analysis of tumor mutational signature dynamics at single-cell resolution. To do this, SigDyn combines variant detection, tumor phylogeny inference, and signature identification. We applied SigDyn to scRNA-seq of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Inferred phylogenies recapitulated tumor markers and progression from normal tissue to tumor metastasis. Tumor-specific processes beyond aging, like cellular disruptions or patient treatments, were only exposed at single-cell level reinforcing the importance of granularity. For IDC, prominence of signature SBS26 with tumor evolution pointed to mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency, supported by downregulation of MMR genes. For LSCC, metastasis enrichment with SBS32-active cells and immune markers suggested influence of immunosuppressant treatment azathioprine, linked to increased risk of SCCs. The dynamics uncovered by SigDyn confirm its potential as a tool to investigate mechanisms of tumor evolution and heterogeneity. Availability: github.com/joanagoncalveslab/sigdyn.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> RNA binding proteins (RBPs) control gene expression through their activities in essentially all processing steps of coding and noncoding RNAs and are dysregulated in disease. With &gt;95% of human multi-exon genes undergoing alternative splicing, the inability to assign RBP sites to distinct RNA variants fundamentally limits our understanding of RNA regulation. We present dirCLIP, a method combining UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) with amplification-free direct nanopore long-read sequencing preserving full-length transcripts. dirCLIP employs two complementary strategies: direct RNA sequencing detecting amino acid adduct-induced perturbations in current signals and direct cDNA sequencing capturing binding sites as mutations. Benchmarking dirCLIP with SRSF3 demonstrated &gt;75% concordance with short-read-based data, revealed isoform-selective RNA binding and enabled detection of co-occurring binding sites in single RNA molecules. Application to the noncanonical RBP HMGA1 uncovered new AT-hook mediated RNA variant-specific interactions. dirCLIP fundamentally transforms our ability to interrogate RNA regulation of distinct isoforms and transcript variants with direct implications to disease mechanisms and development of RNA therapeutics.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> MutY excises adenine (A) from 8-oxo-guanine:adenine (OG:A) lesions in DNA to initiate base excision repair (BER) and thereby prevent mutations. A catalytic Glu, found at position 43 in the enzyme from Geobacillus stearothermophilus (Gs MutY), protonates the nucleobase at N7 to labilize the N-glycosidic bond. The resulting oxocarbenium ion transition state is stabilized by a covalent DNA-enzyme intermediate and resolved by nucleophilic attack to yield the beta-anomer abasic AP site product. The retaining SN1 mechanism for MutY posits deprotonation of the nucleophile by the catalytic Glu. Here we tested kinetic and structural consequences of Glu replacement and found that E43Q and E43S substitution variants were severely impaired, retained measurable activity, but engage the substrate nucleobase in an anti conformation, rotated by 180{degrees} from the syn conformation seen in previous substrate complexes. The enzyme-generated AP product is observed in its alpha-anomer configuration for these Glu-replacement variants. Comparison with inverting adenine glycosylases that act on RNA or nucleosides shows that MutY&#x27;s mechanism is uniquely reliant on one catalytic residue for both leaving group and nucleophile activation, a situation that may serve to ensure only rare adenines paired with OG are excised.</p>

Carbapenem resistance is a rising clinical concern, and is frequently associated with OXA-48 and its variants. OXA-48 variants carrying different mutations in the {beta}5-{beta}6 loop differ in hydrolytic activity towards imipenem. OXA-517 has a higher KM, but similar kcat for imipenem hydrolysis, compared to OXA-48, whereas OXA-163 and -405, which have similar mutations in the {beta}5-{beta}6 loop, are less active. Multiscale simulations (using quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics, QM/MM) of deacylation of the respective imipenem acylenzymes show this to be most efficient when the deacylating water (DW) acts as a hydrogen bond (H-bond) donor to imipenem, and the carboxylated Lys73 base is less hydrated. Calculated barriers for deacylation correlate very well with experimental data, but for OXA-163 and -405 only when DW acts as a H-bond acceptor. Dynamics simulations of imipenem acylenzyme complexes show that mutations in the {beta}5-{beta}6 loop change the active site H-bond network. In OXA-48, the DW H-bonding pattern linked to high activity is more frequently sampled, and in OXA-517 it is stabilised through H-bonding to Thr213; explaining the higher kcat values compared to OXA-163 and -405, where this is not the case. Furthermore, simulations of non-covalent imipenem complexes indicate that increased KM for OXA-517 is linked to lower binding affinity, caused by repositioning of bound imipenem. Our work identifies the molecular basis for differences in imipenem hydrolytic activity between OXA-48 variants, offering detailed insights into how active site interactions alter the dynamics and reaction efficiencies related to antibiotic resistance.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The olfactory system plays a critical role in mammalian environmental perception, with some clades relying on an expanded accessory olfactory (vomeronasal) system (VNS) to detect larger, non-volatile odorants. Mammals make extensive use of this system for social communication between conspecifics. Recent studies have begun to investigate how the VNS changes in response to or as part of ecological transitions. Several studies have identified trends of VNS-associated gene loss or regression in secondarily aquatic mammals. However, continuing discussion on genotype-phenotype correlation within the VNS means that greater effort should be made to investigate the morphology of the VNS in species where it remains poorly understood. Here, we use skeletal and soft-tissue data to demonstrate that the vomeronasal groove, an established osteological correlate for the VNO in bats and primates, is also a valid indicator for its presence in Caniformia. Additionally, we confirm the presence of the VNO in the secondarily aquatic North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) and compare its morphology with that of two close-related species, the semi-aquatic American mink (Neogale vison) and the terrestrial long-tailed weasel (Neogale frenata). This study expands the valid taxonomic scope of the vomeronasal groove proxy as an osteological correlate, confirms the presence of the VNO in the previously undescribed system of the North American river otter, and highlights the complexity of the mammalian accessory olfactory system.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Skeletal muscle aging (sarcopenia) is associated with reduced peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) during exercise, a key determinant of physical function and overall health. However, the molecular mechanisms linking muscle aging to low VO2peak remain poorly understood. We aimed to identify miRNA signatures and miRNA/gene regulatory networks associated with VO2peak in older adults. Using small RNA and mRNA sequencing, we analyzed skeletal muscle from 72 SOMMA participants (70 to 79 years old) with low or high VO2peak (n = 18/group) and from 36 participants spanning the full VO2peakk spectrum. Differential expression was assessed using LIMMA, with pathway and network analyses performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) and Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA). We detected 1,408 miRNAs and 16,210 genes; among these, 14 miRNAs and 2,018 genes were differentially expressed (FDR &lt; 0.05). The 14 miRNAs regulated 142 genes, and expression of 10 miRNAs inversely correlated with 50 genes enriched in mitochondrial, sirtuin1, and nitric oxide signaling pathways. Regression analyses identified 21 miRNAs and 1,744 genes significantly correlated with VO2peakk after adjusting for age and sex. WGCNA revealed 10 coexpression modules associated with VO2peak, with the cyan module showing the strongest correlation and enrichment for nitric oxide signaling genes. These findings highlight novel miRNA mediated molecular pathways potentially contributing to low VO2peak and skeletal muscle aging in older adults. Future studies will further investigate these miRNA/gene interactions to uncover therapeutic targets for preserving muscle function with age.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Drosophila miranda is considered an excellent model for studying sex chromosome evolution due to its neo-sex chromosomes, which originated from fusions between autosomes and sex chromosomes. In this study, we took advantage of the latest genome assembly of D. miranda to design the first oligo probe libraries targeting neo-sex chromosomes, covering X and Y-linked regions with times ranging from ~1.5 to 60 million years. These libraries, which include both single-copy and repetitive oligos, were generated by integrating the OligoY approach to the conventional OligoMiner pipeline and validated through fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We optimized oligo density and spacing parameters to predict consistent and effective chromosome painting. Beyond tool improvement, our mapping of the three largest unplaced Y-linked scaffolds in D. miranda reveals a complex evolutionary mechanism driving the current structure of the Y chromosome, including chromosomal translocation, centromere loss, and inversions. This work provides essential tools for sex chromosome identification via probe labeling and offers a foundation for exploring the spatial and evolutionary dynamics of sex chromosomes across different cell types.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations yield atomic-level insights into molecular motion but struggle to reach the long timescales needed for rare events due to prohibitive computational costs. Generative machine-learning models (e.g., diffusion models and normalizing flows) offer a promising route to accelerate sampling, yet they generate independent equilibrium snapshots without temporal correlation or kinetic information. Autoregressive sequence models can learn time evolution by producing one frame at a time, but this stepwise generation often accumulates errors and drifts from true dynamics. Here, we propose a complementary approach inspired by advances in image and video generation: we treat finite MD trajectory segments as high-dimensional objects and learn their joint distribution using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Using a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty, we directly generate entire time-series trajectories in one shot, that remain physically coherent over time without explicitly integrating the equations of motion. We demonstrate the generality of this method on molecular systems of increasing complexity: a 2D triple-well potential energy landscape, a protein-ligand binding process (cytochrome P450), the dynamics of an intrinsically disordered protein (-synuclein) in a latent coordinate space, and even the conditional generation of folding trajectories for the Trp-cage mini-protein. In all cases, the GAN-generated trajectories closely reproduce the true free-energy landscapes and kinetic signatures of the systems, while enabling efficient sampling of rare events that would ordinarily require months of conventional MD simulation.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Live-cell single-molecule imaging reveals that nascent switch-region RNAs form a dynamic transcriptional “RNA hub” at the IgH locus that binds and recruits AID to drive targeted cytidine deamination during class switch recombination.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) converts cytosines to uracils within the actively transcribed switch regions to initiate DNA repair and formation of DNA double strand breaks required for immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR). How AID specifically targets switch regions remains a key unanswered question. Using a multimodal live cell single molecule imaging approach, we demonstrate that intronic switch regions promote robust transcription by enhancing polymerase loading and persistent transcriptional bursts, resulting in the formation of a dynamic RNA hub consisting of numerous nascent switch transcripts simultaneously tethered to the IgH locus. We further demonstrate that AID interacts with switch region RNA in vivo, and that this interaction is required for recruitment of AID to the IgH locus. Together, our findings show that the RNA hub formed by nascent switch region transcripts may be part of a class switch recombination center and drives the specific recruitment of AID to the IgH locus to initiate CSR.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein interactions with DNA often result in rotational movements. These movements underlie many genetic processes such as DNA transcription by RNA polymerase (RNAP). To illuminate these movements, we previously developed Origami Rotor-Based Imaging and Tracking (ORBIT), a fluorescence-based method that enables high-speed tracking of DNA rotation. When used to track DNA rotation during transcription by E. coli RNAP, ORBIT enabled detection of single base-pair steps. However, the duration of ORBIT experiments was limited due to fluorescence photobleaching. To overcome this limitation and extend the total possible observation time, we here introduce dye-cycling ORBIT (dcORBIT), a method that enables observation of protein-DNA interactions for over 10 minutes at 20 Hz while maintaining single base-pair precision. dcORBIT thereby opens new possibilities to study the fundamental rotational movements underlying gene expression.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) are routinely recovered from metagenomic studies, yet the population genetic information embedded within these datasets remains largely underutilized. Analyzing within-species genetic variation can reveal adaptive evolution, selection pressures, and ecological dynamics that are hidden when MAGs are treated as homogeneous entities. Existing tools address individual analysis steps in isolation, requiring manual integration and creating barriers for researchers without extensive bioinformatics expertise. Here we present PopMAG, a Nextflow pipeline and interactive Shiny application that automates population genetics analysis of MAGs. PopMAG integrates quality control, community profiling, competitive read mapping, functional annotation, and microdiversity estimation into a single reproducible workflow. The pipeline calculates key population genetics metrics including nucleotide diversity ({pi}), pN/pS ratios, fixation index (FST), Levins index and SNVs counts with results consolidated into an interactive visualization platform for metadata-driven exploration. We demonstrate PopMAGs utility through analysis of longitudinal cystic fibrosis lung metagenomes, where we detect signatures of antibiotic-driven selection in Pseudomonas aeruginosa efflux pump genes coinciding with treatment intervention.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Using the new T2T human genome and probabilistic handling of multi-mapped ChIP-seq reads, the study finds rapid cis-regulatory turnover across human segmental duplications while gene expression remains correlated, potentially buffered by 3D genome proximity.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Segmental duplications (SDs) are a pervasive feature of eukaryotic genomes, enabling genomic innovation via the duplication of genes and cis-regulatory elements. However, the regulatory mechanisms that govern these regions of the genome after duplication are not well understood. The repetitive nature of SDs pose problems for short-read assays such as ChIP-seq and DNase-seq as they create reads that map to more than one location along the genome. Moreover, the newest Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) human genome assembly has revealed previously unknown segmental duplications. In this study, we used the Telomere-to-Telomere genome assembly along with the probabilistic allocation of multi-mapped reads by our software Allo to better understand the regulatory mechanisms governing segmental duplications in the human genome. Using 134 transcription factor ChIP-seq datasets in GM12878, we found that transcription factor binding sites within segmental duplications are rarely conserved across paralogous copies. Similarly, chromatin states defined via histone ChIP-seq datasets are also poorly conserved across segmentally duplicated regions. In contrast, paralogous genes within SDs exhibit highly correlated expression patterns. Hi-C analysis revealed that many SD paralogs have higher than expected spatial proximity, suggesting that three-dimensional genome organization may buffer transcriptional divergence following duplication despite the loss of cis-regulatory regions. Together, our results suggest that regulatory regions undergo rapid turnover following segmental duplication, but the regulatory impact may be buffered by spatial proximity within the nucleus. Tissue-specific genes and transcription factors showed greater divergence, highlighting the role of SDs in expanding specialized cellular functions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Multi-year field study shows repeated evolution of reproductive diapause and cue-dependent plasticity in Amazon butterflies, offering insights into modular trait evolution but little direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Seasonality drives the evolution of reproductive plasticity in butterflies. An extreme form is reproductive diapause, where individuals halt reproduction during unfavourable seasons through cascades translating predictive environmental cues into reproductive phenotypes. How diapause evolves from milder forms of plasticity through changes in those cascades is poorly understood. In the tropics seasonality is common, but it is unclear how phylogenetically widespread reproductive diapause is, and exactly how seasonal tropical climates drive reproductive plasticity. Here, we study reproductive plasticity in Amazon butterflies using a multi-year monthly time series of reproductive phenotypes. Sampling 4 subfamilies across Nymphalids, we observe a phylogenetically widespread occurrence of diapause, suggesting repeated evolutionary changes in reproductive plasticity. Detailed analyses of two Catonephele species reveal a shared temperature response, but dry season diapause only in C. acontius. Thus, evolution of diapause combines cue conservation with species-specific divergence of trait plasticity, suggesting gradual and modular evolution of reproductive plasticity.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Describes a rapid hyperbaric-heating, two-step method to lyse diverse organisms and produce PCR/RT-PCR–ready DNA/RNA directly from complex matrices, offering potentially useful sample-prep capability for astrobiology life-detection workflows but not directly addressing origins-of-life mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Traditional nucleic acid extraction methods are costly, lengthy, and highly variable depending on the complexity of the sample matrix or the organism of interest. Workflows may exceed twenty steps, require separate kits for RNA and DNA, and demand expensive instrumentation, creating barriers to both speed and scalability. The AutolabTM HBH system addresses these limitations by using hyperbaric heating (HBH) to achieve temperatures above 100 degree Celsius in a sealed, pressurized environment through induction heating, enabling rapid lysis of diverse organisms and neutralization of macromolecular PCR inhibitors within minutes. The combination of extreme heat and HBH-optimized lyophilized reagents rapidly inactivates nucleases while preserving free nucleic acids. The workflow is streamlined to two steps: heating up to 1 mL of sample in the proprietary HBH bullet, followed by a brief centrifugation to pellet additives. The resulting supernatant is immediately compatible with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and other downstream molecular assays. Here, we evaluate the systems broad compatibility with diverse sample buffers, matrices, and organisms. Comparative testing was conducted alongside Qiagen extraction methods to benchmark performance.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> by Pranav Mahajan, Peter Dayan, Ben Seymour Injuries are an unfortunate but inevitable fact of life, leading to an evolutionary mandate for powerful homeostatic processes of recovery and recuperation. The physiological responses of the body and the immune system must be coordinated with behaviour to allow protected time for this to happen, and to prevent further damage to the affected bodily parts. Reacting appropriately requires an internal control system that represents the nature and state of the injury and specifies and withholds actions accordingly. We bring the formal uncertainties embodied in this system into the framework of a partially observable Markov decision process. We discuss nociceptive phenomena in light of this analysis, noting particularly the counter-intuitive behaviours associated with injury investigation, and the propensity for transitions from normative, tonic, to pathological, chronic pain states. Importantly, these simulation results provide a quantitative account and enable us to sketch a much needed roadmap for future theoretical and experimental studies on injury, tonic pain, and the transition to chronic pain.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Using polymer modeling and contact-map analysis, this study finds that cohesin in budding yeast produces sparse, loosely aligning (and asymmetric) sister-chromatid cohesion after replication, refining our understanding of eukaryotic genome organization rather than directly addressing origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Following DNA replication, cohesion maintains sister chromatids in spatial proximity with a certain degree of alignment. This tethering, mediated by the cohesin complex,may facilitate DNA repair and enable proper chromosome individualization and segregation during mitosis. However, it is still unclear how cohesion is established and how it reshapes the relative organization of replicated chromosomes to achieve its functions. In this study, we address these questions in the biological context of budding yeast, by disentangling the interplay between two major structural functions of cohesin: organizing individual chromatids through loop extrusion and sister chromatids through cohesion. Combining polymer modeling and detailed analysis of recent experimental data of replicated chromosomes in G2/M, we show that extruding and cohesive cohesins are sparsely distributed leading to mildly compacted and loosely aligned sister chromatids. Genome-wide analysis of inter-chromatid contact maps in WT and mutant conditions suggests that cohesion is asymmetric, favoring the tethering between non-homologous cohesin-enriched regions. Our work highlights the dual role played by cohesin in structuring the replicated genome and questions how homologous recombination may function in the context of asymmetric, partial alignment of sister chromatids.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Experimental evolution in Salmonella shows that point mutations in alternative genes (hisA or trpA) can restore tryptophan biosynthesis after trpF loss via bifunctional alleles, illustrating a plausible route to new gene functions without gene duplication.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> How new gene functions arise while maintaining ancestral biological roles remains a central question in evolutionary genetics. To investigate genetic solutions to disruption of a biosynthetic pathway without prior genetic bias, we used experimental evolution to study restoration of tryptophan biosynthesis in Salmonella enterica strains lacking the trpF gene. Populations were founded from bacteria carrying wild-type alleles of all relevant genes in their native genomic and regulatory contexts and evolved under conditions selecting for growth without exogenous tryptophan. Across independent populations, mutations in either hisA or trpA enabled growth of trpF strains in the absence of added tryptophan while retaining sufficient ancestral function to support growth under the same conditions. Whole-genome sequencing and genetic reconstruction showed that these mutant alleles were sufficient to confer the growth-rescue phenotype. Duplication of the target gene was detected in only a single population and showed no evidence of functional divergence. Mutational paths differed between genes: hisA-based solutions arose primarily in mutator backgrounds and were associated with stronger trade-offs with ancestral function, whereas trpA-based solutions were more frequent and often retained native function. Together, these results demonstrate that bifunctional genetic solutions can arise through point mutations in multiple genes during experimental adaptation, illustrating how gene-level multifunctionality can evolve without gene duplication.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> María Fernanda Sánchez-Puig, Carlos Gershenson, Carlos Pineda The large digital archives of the American Physical Society (APS) offer an opportunity to quantitatively analyze the structure and evolution of scientific communication. In this paper, we perform a comparative analysis of the language used in eight APS journals (Phys. Rev. A, B, C, D, E, Lett., X, Rev. Mod. Phys.) using methods from statistical linguistics. We study word rank distributions (from monograms to hexagrams), finding that they are consistent with Zipf’s law. We also analyze rank diversity over time, which follows a characteristic sigmoid shape. To quantify the linguistic similarity between journals, we use the rank-biased overlap (RBO) distance, comparing the journals not only to each other, but also to corpora from Google Books and Twitter. This analysis reveals that the most significant differences emerge when focusing on content words rather than the full vocabulary. By identifying the unique and common content words for each specialized journal, we develop an article classifier that predicts a paper’s journal of origin based on its unique word distribution. This classifier uses a proposed “importance factor” to weigh the significance of each word. Finally, we analyze the frequency of mention of prominent physicists and compare it to their cultural recognitions ranked in the Pantheon dataset, finding a low correlation that highlights the context-dependent nature of scientific fame. These results demonstrate that scientific language itself can serve as a quantitative window into the organization and evolution of science. Read the full article at: www.preprints.org</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Uses spatial single-cell RNA transcriptomics to map developmental gene-expression gradients in the mouse cochlea, with no direct relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The cochlea, the sensory organ of hearing, functions as a frequency analyzer, analogous to a musical instrument. During development, while the medio-lateral axis supports differentiation of sensory cells and their surrounding supporting cells, the longitudinal axis underlies frequency-dependent properties of the cochlea. The combination of these two gene expression gradients defines unique physiological attributes of each cell intimately linked to its position within the cochlea. To determine which cochlear cell-types have a transcriptomic signature sensitive to these two gradients and identify the underlying gene regulatory networks, we took advantage of the advent of spatial single cell transcriptomics methodologies. We therefore generated a spatial transcriptomic atlas reaching single cell resolution based on the Visium HD technique, a sequencing-based technology that employ arrays of spatially barcoded probes to capture RNA molecules unbiasedly from histological tissue sections. Spatial transcriptional changes during embryonic stages, E14 and E16, as well as during postnatal development, P1 and P8, were investigated. Based on this dataset, not only cell-type assignment in single cell RNA-seq experiments could be validated, but the classification for some cell-types could be refined. Gradients of gene expression along the medio-lateral and longitudinal axes in multiple cell-types together with their temporal dynamics across development were also uncovered. Altogether, this atlas paves the way for deciphering gene regulatory networks controlling gene expression as a function of position in the cochlear cell types, providing a valuable resource for the design of efficient, robust and safe gene therapy strategies.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a deep-learning framework (VAETracer) to infer cell generation index and reconstruct tumor lineages from noisy scRNA-seq 3&#x27;UTR mutation profiles, enabling developmental trajectory and latent state inference.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Somatic mutations accumulate with cell division and are key to understanding tumor evolution. While single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) can effectively capture somatic mutations in the 3&#x27; untranslated region (3&#x27; UTR), enabling its use for lineage tracing, these data are inherently noisy and exhibit high false-positive rates. To address this limitation, we propose VAETracer, a deep learning framework that is able to reconstruct cellular lineages by extracting cellular generation index (CGI) from mutation profiles of 3&#x27; UTR in scRNA-seq data, thus enabling the inference of developmental trajectories without relying on noisy mutation signals (https://github.com/Kaiyu-W/VAETracer). There are two core components for VAETracer: (1) scMut module, which infers the CGI directly from sparse and noisy mutation matrices using our cumulative mutation model (CMM), effectively bypassing error-prone phylogenetic tree topologies caused by mutation noise, and (2) MutTracer module, which predicts ancestral and future latent cellular states or gene expressions at the single-cell level by integrating CGI information with measured transcriptomes. Validation on simulated and real tumor datasets shows that this method can accurately reconstruct clonal relationships, quantify tumor progression, and effectively infer unmeasured cellular states using only the measured scRNA-seq data. This work provides a new computational tool for extracting lineage information and revealing tumor evolution directly from widely available RNA-seq data.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2408.00826v4 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: In quantum systems, purification can map mixed states into pure states and a non-unitary evolution into a unitary one by enlarging the Hilbert space. We establish a connection between the complexities of mixed quantum states and their purification, proposing new inequalities among these complexities. By examining single qubits, two-qubit Werner states, eight-dimensional Gaussian random unitary ensembles, and infinite-dimensional systems, we demonstrate how these relationships manifest across a broad class of systems. We find that the spread complexity of purification of a vacuum state evolving into a thermal state equals the average number of Rindler particles. This complexity is also shown to adhere to the Lloyd-like bound, indicating a further relation to the quantum speed limit. Finally, using mutual Krylov complexity, we observe subadditivity of the Krylov complexities, which contrasts with known results from holographic volume complexity. We put forward Krylov mutual complexity as a diagnosis of a potential gravity dual of Krylov complexities.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2505.18367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Variational counterdiabatic (CD) driving is a disciplined and widely used method to robustly control quantum many-body systems by mimicking adiabatic processes with high fidelity and reduced duration. Central to this technique is a universal structure of the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) over a parameterized Hamiltonian. Here, we reveal that introducing a new degree of freedom into the theory of the AGP can significantly improve variational CD driving. Specifically, we find that the algebraic characterization of the AGP is not unique, and we exploit this non-uniqueness to develop the weighted variational method for deriving a refined driving protocol. This approach extends the conventional method in two aspects: it assigns customized weights to matrix elements relevant to specific problems, and it effectively incorporates nonlocal information. We also develop an efficient numerical algorithm to compute the refined driving protocol using computer algebra. Our framework is broadly applicable and, in principle, it can replace any previous use of variational CD driving. We demonstrate its practicality by applying it to adiabatic evolution along the ground state of a parameterized Hamiltonian. This proposal outperforms the conventional method in terms of fidelity, as confirmed by extensive numerical simulations on quantum Ising models.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2504.11664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: We investigate quantum work statistics within the standard two-point measurement (TPM) scheme in continuously monitored quantum systems, including the effects of generalized unitary evolution, possibly controlled by quantum circuit models, and multiple generalized measurements as well as post-selection of no-click trajectories. We derive an explicit expression for the work generating function that naturally incorporates non-Hermitian dynamics arising from quantum jump processes and reveals deviations from the standard Jarzynski equality due to measurement-induced asymmetries. We illustrate our theoretical framework by analyzing a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model under local spin monitoring. In this model, increased measurement strength projects the system onto the no-click state, leading to a suppression of energy fluctuations and measurement-induced energy saturation, reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect. Moreover, we find signatures of the measurement-induced transition observed in the no-click limit in the moments of the work distribution.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Proposes an LLM-guided framework to dynamically evolve operators in evolutionary algorithms for flexible job shop scheduling, improving optimization performance but with no direct connection to origins-of-life or astrobiology research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.16485v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Customized static operator design has enabled widespread application of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), but their search performance is transient during iterations and prone to degradation. Dynamic operators aim to address this but typically rely on predefined designs and localized parameter control during the search process, lacking adaptive optimization throughout evolution. To overcome these limitations, this work leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to perceive evolutionary dynamics and enable operator-level meta-evolution. The proposed framework, LLMs for Evolutionary Optimization (LLM4EO), comprises three components: knowledge-transfer-based operator design, evolution perception and analysis, and adaptive operator evolution. Firstly, initialization of operators is performed by transferring the strengths of classical operators via LLMs. Then, search preferences and potential limitations of operators are analyzed by integrating fitness performance and evolutionary features, accompanied by corresponding suggestions for improvement. Upon stagnation of population evolution, gene selection priorities of operators are dynamically optimized via improvement prompting strategies. This approach achieves co-evolution of populations and operators in the search, introducing a novel paradigm for enhancing the efficiency and adaptability of EAs. Finally, a series of validations on multiple benchmark datasets of the flexible job shop scheduling problem demonstrate that LLM4EO accelerates population evolution and outperforms both mainstream evolutionary programming and traditional EAs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.15026v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a two-qubit open quantum system, in particular the two-qubit spin-boson model in the strong coupling regime, coupled to two thermal bosonic baths under non-Markovian and non-equilibrium conditions. Two complementary approaches, the Hierarchical Equations of Motion (HEOM) and Reaction Coordinate Mapping (RCM), are employed to examine various coupling regimes between the qubits and their respective baths. The dynamical features of the model and the impact of the tunneling amplitude on quantum coherence of the system are probed using the $l_1$-norm of coherence. The model is further shown to have non-Markovian evolution. The nontrivial task of calculating entropy production in the strong-coupling regime is performed using auxiliary density operators in HEOM. Motivated by the realization of a quantum thermal device in the strong-coupling regime, the non-equilibrium steady-state behavior of the system is investigated. Furthermore, the relationship between the heat and spin currents and the tunneling amplitude is probed.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Develops an exact generalized BBGKY hierarchy for perturbed integrable many-body systems (validated against simulations), a theoretical advance in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics with only very indirect relevance to origins-of-life chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2408.00593v5 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We study quantum and classical many-body Hamiltonian systems that combine integrable contact interactions with generic long-range two-body potentials. We show that the dynamics of local observables can be cast into a generalized Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (gBBGKY) hierarchy formulated in terms of the quasiparticle densities of the underlying integrable model and their correlations. Starting from an ansatz for the state at time $t$, which we call the correlated fluid-cell ensemble, we derive this hierarchy and prove that it reproduces exactly the time evolution of one- and multi-point correlation functions in perturbed integrable models, at all times. We validate these predictions against microscopic molecular-dynamics simulations, finding perfect agreement. At late times, the one-particle distribution relaxes via a Boltzmann-type scattering integral encoding the interplay between integrable contact processes and long-range collisions, whereas higher-point correlations remain strongly non-thermal on thermalization time scales, indicative of a form of incomplete or generalised thermalisation. Focusing on long-range dipolar quantum gases, where the relevant matrix elements can be obtained explicitly, we show that our collision integral reduces exactly to the Fermi golden rule result and provide a complete theoretical account of the experimental observations of Tang et al. (Phys.Rev.X 8, 021030 (2018)). More broadly, our framework extends the BBGKY program to regimes with strong local interactions, and applies to a wide class of experimentally relevant systems, from one-dimensional dipolar cold-atom gases to Lennard-Jones molecular fluids.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.14371v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Small asteroids and large meteoroids frequently impact the Earth, though their physical and material properties remain poorly understood. When observed as fireballs in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, these properties can be inferred from their ablation and fragmentation behavior. The 2022 release of previously classified United States Government (USG) satellite sensor data has provided hundreds of new fireball light curves, allowing for more detailed analysis. Here we present a new Bayesian inference method based on dynamic nested sampling that can robustly estimate these objects&#x27; physical parameters from their observed light curves, starting from relatively uninformative, flat priors. We validate our method against seven USG sensor-observed fireballs with independent ground-based observations and demonstrate that our results are consistent with previous estimates. We then apply our technique to $13$ decameter-size Earth impactors to conduct the most detailed population-level study of their structure and material strength to date. We identify three structurally distinct groups within the decameter impactors. The first group are primarily structurally homogeneous, weak objects which catastrophically disrupt below $\sim1.5$ MPa. The second group are heterogeneous objects which progressively fragment starting from $\sim1$ MPa typically up to $\sim3-8$ MPa. The third group are strong aggregates which remain mostly intact until $9-10$ MPa. Our results also suggest that decameter-size asteroids fragment in two distinct phases: an initial phase at $\sim0.04-0.09$ MPa and a second at $\sim1-4$ MPa. While decimeter- to meter-size objects typically lose most of their mass in the initial phase, larger decameter-size objects instead lose most of their mass in the second phase.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.14367v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The origin of hot Jupiters is the oldest problem in exoplanet astrophysics. Hot Jupiters formed in situ or via disk migration should be in place just a few Myr after the formation of their host stars. On the other hand, hot Jupiters formed via eccentricity excitation and tidal damping as a result of planet--planet scattering or Kozai-Lidov oscillations may take 1 Gyr or more to arrive at their observed locations. We propose that the relative ages of hot Jupiters inside, near, and outside the bias-corrected peak of the observed hot Jupiter period distribution can be used to distinguish between these possibilities. Though the lack of precise and accurate age inferences for isolated hot Jupiter host stars makes this test difficult to implement, comparisons between the Galactic velocity dispersions of the hot Jupiter subpopulations enable this investigation. To transform relative age offsets into absolute age offsets, we calibrate the monotonically increasing solar neighborhood age--velocity dispersion relation using an all-sky sample of subgiants with precise ages and a metallicity distribution matched to that of hot Jupiter hosts. We find that the inside-peak and near-peak subpopulations are older than the outside-peak subpopulation, with the inside-peak subpopulation slightly older than the near-peak subpopulation. We conclude that at least 40\% but not more than 70\% of the hot Jupiter population must have formed via a late-time, peak-populating process like high-eccentricity migration that typically occurs more than 1.5 Gyr after system formation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.14328v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The formation of topological defects during continuous phase transitions exhibits nonequilibrium universality. While the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) predicts universal scaling of point-like defect numbers under slow driving, the statistical properties of extended defects remain largely unexplored across both slow and fast protocols. We investigate vortex string formation in a three-dimensional holographic superfluid. For slow quenches, the vortex string number follows KZM scaling, while for rapid quenches, it exhibits complementary universal scaling governed by the final temperature. Beyond the vortex string number, the loop-length distribution reveals a richer structure: individual loops follow the first-return statistics of three-dimensional random walks, $P(\ell) \sim \ell^{-5/2}$. While the total vortex length distribution remains Gaussian, its cumulants obey universal scaling laws with varying power-law exponents, and thus differ markedly from those observed in point-defect systems, indicating distinct statistical features of extended topological defects.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.14747v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: This study investigates the mathematical existence and asymptotic properties of Ulanowicz&#x27;s structural resilience in complex systems such as supply chain networks. While ecological evidence suggests that sustainable systems gravitate toward an optimal state at $\alpha = 1/\mathrm{e}$, the universality of this configuration in generalized networks remains theoretically unverified. We prove that while optimal resilience is unattainable in two-node networks due to structural over-determinacy, it exists for any directed graph with $N_\mathcal{V} \geq 3$. By constructing a symmetric network model with three types of link weights $(x, y, z)$ and uniform marginal distributions, we derive the governing equations for the optimal resilience configuration. Our analytical and numerical results reveal that as the network size $N_\mathcal{V}$ increases, the link weights required to maintain optimal resilience exhibit a power-law scaling behavior: the adjacent links scale as $O(N_\mathcal{V}^{-1})$, while the non-adjacent links scale as $O(N_\mathcal{V}^{-2})$, both accompanied by specific logarithmic corrections. This work establishes a rigorous mathematical foundation for the optimal resilience framework and provides a unified perspective on how entropy-based principles govern the robustness and evolution of large-scale complex networks, which may offer quantitative guidance for designing large-scale networked systems under robustness constraints.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2505.01512v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The discovery of inhabited exoplanets hinges on identifying biosignature gases. JWST can reveal biosignature gases, though current discoveries have yet to evidence life. The central challenge is attribution: how can we confidently identify biogenic sources while ruling out, or deeming unlikely, abiotic explanations? Attribution is particularly difficult for individual planets, especially given the stochastic abiotic processes that can set atmospheric conditions. To address this, we propose a comparative multi-planet approach centred on systemic retrievals: the analysis of multiple planets within a system to empirically define the `abiotic baseline&#x27;. This baseline, constructed from obligate uninhabited planets, serves as a local reference point. Systemic retrievals enable marginalisation over inaccessible, latent, shared abiotic parameters within planet evolution models. This is possible because planets within a system are linked by their birth in the same natal disk, have been irradiated by the same evolving star, and have a linked dynamical history. Observations aligning with the abiotic baseline, where the locally-informed abiotic planet evolution models demonstrate high out-of-sample predictive accuracy, are likely non-biological. Potentially biological anomalies are identified as statistical outliers from the abiotic baseline using Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation. A comparative biosignature is thus defined: an anomaly where a biotic planetary evolution model provides a superior fit than its abiotic counterpart. Where both abiotic and biotic models yield poor predictive accuracy, the anomaly is flagged as an ``unknown unknown&quot;; a signature of either unconstrained abiotic processes, or life as we don&#x27;t yet know it.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.14948v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Earth&#x27;s ionosphere is a perpetual detector of ionizing radiation received from celestial objects, particularly the Sun. Solar ionizing radiation in the form of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-rays during both quiet and active phase of the Sun, and charged particles associated with a solar wind imprint their ionization signatures on the ionosphere. Although due to the bipolar nature of the geomagnetic field, the events, such as the solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and associated solar wind enhancement, usually disturb the polar ionosphere only, the UV and X-rays from the solar flares produce sudden ionospheric disturbances (SIDs) in low-mid-latitude part of the earth&#x27;s ionosphere. Such ionospheric disturbances are studied with the help of the influence they exert on radio waves propagating through earth-ionosphere waveguide. For the lower part of the ionosphere, called the D region, prominent modification in electron-ion density during solar flares can be observed via deviation in earth bound Very Low Frequency (VLF) wave signal from its ambient diurnal profile. In earlier work, successful model of the deviation in VLF amplitude due to different classes of solar flares was formulated. There, calculation of rate of ionization with Monte Carlo simulation and ion-chemistry evaluation of plasma density enhancement followed by a radio propagation simulation was used. Presently, we attempt to numerically reconstruct the modulation in VLF signal from its diurnal pattern produced by multiple solar flares occurring over a single day. Successful reconstruction of the VLF signal modulation for such a complex flaring scenario points to the accuracy of our understanding of the ionization effect due to solar activity on the lower ionosphere, and strengthen our claim to use earth&#x27;s ionosphere as a high energy space transient event detector.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.15285v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The A1V star $\gamma$ Oph, at a distance of 29.7 pc, is known from Spitzer imaging to host a debris disk with a large radial extent and from its spectral energy distribution to host inner warm dust. We imaged $\gamma$ Oph with JWST/MIRI at 15 and 25.5 microns, which reveal smooth and radially broad emission that extends to a radius of at least 250 au at 25.5 microns. In contrast to JWST findings of an inner small-grain component with distinct ringed substructures in Fomalhaut and Vega, the mid-infrared radial profile combined with prior ALMA imaging suggests a radially broad steady-state collisional cascade with the same grain size distribution throughout the disk. This further suggests that the system is populated by a radially broad planetesimal belt from tens of au or less to well over 200 au, rather than a narrow planetesimal belt from which the observed dust is displaced to appear broad. The disk is also found to be asymmetric, which could be modelled by a stellocentric offset corresponding to a small eccentricity of $\sim$0.02. Such a disk eccentricity could be induced by a mildly eccentric $&lt;$$10\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$ giant planet outside 10 au, or a more eccentric companion up to stellar mass at a few au, without producing a resolvable radial gap in the disk.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.14877v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) Full-Frame Images (FFIs) provide photometric time series for millions of stars, enabling transit searches beyond the limited set of pre-selected 2-minute targets. However, FFIs present additional challenges for transit identification and vetting. In this work, we apply ExoMiner++ 2.0, an adaptation of the ExoMiner++ framework originally developed for TESS 2-minute data, to FFI light curves. The model is used to perform large-scale planet versus non-planet classification of Threshold Crossing Events across the sectors analyzed in this study. We construct a uniform vetting catalog of all evaluated signals and assess model performance under different observing conditions. We find that ExoMiner++ 2.0 generalizes effectively to the FFI domain, providing robust discrimination between planetary signals, astrophysical false positives, and instrumental artifacts despite the limitations inherent to longer cadence data. This work extends the applicability of ExoMiner++ to the full TESS dataset and supports future population studies and follow-up prioritization.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Develops a nonlinear hydrodynamics framework showing dynamical tides can significantly shift the effective Roche limit in eccentric, asynchronous binaries, with implications for mass loss and evolution of migrating gaseous exoplanets and repeated partial tidal disruptions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2508.20183v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The Roche limit, or the threshold separation within which a celestial object (the donor) M cannot remain in a stable configuration due to a companion&#x27;s tidal field, has been well established when M is in hydrostatic equilibrium and has synchronous rotation in a circular orbit. However, limited analyses exist considering corrections to the Roche limit due to hydrodynamical effects. We fill in the gap by providing a general theoretical framework involving nonlinear hydrodynamics. We consider both exact nonlinear equations derived from an affine model describing incompressible ellipsoids and series-expanded ones that can be calculated for realistic stars and planets. Our formulation addresses the Roche problem in generic orbits and synchronization levels of M, and fully accounts for the history-dependent hydrodynamical effects. We show that as the orbital eccentricity increases, fluid instability is more likely to develop at the pericenter due to the increased dynamical tide that accumulates over multiple orbits. When M moves in a highly eccentric orbit (with eccentricity around 0.9) and the damping of the fluid is small, the threshold pericenter separation at which mass loss from M can occur can be at least 30% higher than the value predicted for a circular orbit with hydrostatic equilibrium. If only a single passage is considered, however, the threshold separation is 20% smaller than the static limit. The nonlinear interaction at each pericenter passage can also trigger a chaotic fluid evolution inside M even with moderate eccentricities, complementing previous studies of chaotic tides caused by random propagation phases. Our work has broad implications for interacting binaries in eccentric orbits, including migrating gaseous exoplanets, repeated partial tidal disruption events, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.15216v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: $\beta$ Pictoris is a young nearby A5V star, about 20 Myr old, embedded in a prominent debris disc. For the past 40 years, variable absorption features have been observed in the stellar spectrum, produced by the gaseous tails of exocomets transiting the star. Yet, despite the large number of observations available, the origin and dynamical evolution of the exocomets remain poorly understood. Here we present new spectroscopic observations of $\beta$ Pic, obtained on April 29, 2025, with the Hubble Space Telescope and the HARPS spectrograph. We report the detection of three strong exocomet signatures at low radial velocities (-7.5, +2.5 and +10 km/s), in a large set of lines from various species and excitation levels. We show that the three exocometary tails have different excitation states, indicating that they are located at different distances from the star. Using a detailed modelling of the excitation state of the transiting gas, which includes both radiative and collisional excitation, we derive the transit distance of the three exocometary gaseous tails to be $0.88 \pm 0.08$, $4.7 \pm 0.3$, and $1.52 \pm 0.15$ au. These values are much larger than previous estimates, which generally placed the transient features within 0.2 au. This reveals that gaseous tails produced by exocomets sublimating close to the star can expand and migrate over large distances, while still remaining detectable in absorption spectroscopy. Our study provides a new method to measure the transit distance of exocomets, based on excitation modelling, complementing the acceleration method only applicable for high-velocity objects.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.15152v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy is a key technique in the characterization of exoplanet atmospheres and has been widely applied to planets undergoing hydrodynamic escape. While a robust analytic theory exists for transmission spectra of hydrostatic atmospheres, the corresponding interpretation for escaping atmospheres has so far relied on numerical modeling. In this work, we develop a theory of transmission spectroscopy in hydrodynamically escaping atmospheres by coupling the standard transmission geometry to a steady-state, spherically symmetric, isothermal outflow. This approach yields closed-form expressions and allows the optical depth inversion problem to be examined. The analytic solution reveals that transmission spectroscopy of planetary winds naturally separates into two regimes. In an opacity-limited regime, transmission depths retain sensitivity to the atmospheric mass-loss rate. Beyond a critical threshold, however, spectral-line cores become saturated and no longer provide a unique constraint on the mass flux. This transition is marked by a sharp analytic boundary of the form $\sigma(\lambda)\times \dot M \le C_{sat}$, where $C_{sat}$ is a constant set by the thermodynamic and geometric properties of the wind. This condition specifies when the inversion between transmission depth and mass-loss rate admits a real solution. Once it is violated, the effective transit radius is no longer controlled by opacity or mass loss, but by the geometric extent of the absorbing wind. These results demonstrate that spectral-line saturation in transmission spectroscopy corresponds to a fundamental loss of invertibility between absorption and atmospheric mass loss, rather than a gradual weakening of sensitivity. The theory provides a physically transparent explanation for why strong transmission line cores often fail to constrain mass-loss rates, while weaker lines and line wings remain diagnostic.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2510.25945v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We investigate the thermal evolution of 3I/ATLAS, the third macroscopic interstellar object discovered on 2025 July 1. By comparing modeled thermal profiles with observations of volatile activity, it is possible to constrain bulk physical properties of a cometary nucleus. 3I/ATLAS is actively producing a variety of cometary volatiles. In this paper, we calculate one-dimensional thermal profiles of the third interstellar object 3I/ATLAS throughout its trajectory in an attempt to gain insight into its bulk properties based on measurements of its volatiles. Assuming a variety of typical comet and asteroid bulk geophysical properties such as heat capacities, densities, and conductivities, we calculate the radial thermal profile as a function of depth throughout the hyperbolic trajectory. The methods and code to generate the thermal profile are flexible for any hyperbolic or bound orbit. The thermal profiles are benchmarked to the nominal sublimation temperatures of H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CO, but are still applicable to any volatile. Comparison between the modeled surface temperatures and the observed onset of H$_2$O activity near 3 au indicates that surface temperatures exceeding $\sim$150 K can only be achieved if the albedo is below 0.2. We therefore set the upper limit on the albedo of 3I/ATLAS to be 0.2.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.05279v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: As the architecture for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is being developed, it is crucial to optimize the observing strategies for a survey to detect and characterize Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars. Efficient target identification and characterization will help drive mission requirements that can be matched to the planned observations. Current HWO concepts allow simultaneous multi-bandpass observations with the coronagraph instrument, critical for performing a qualitative planetary reconnaissance to optimize observing time for deriving orbital constraints and prioritize characterization of promising targets. We describe a new algorithm designed to determine the best combination of broadband photometric observations for extracting maximum information from the first visit. It identifies degeneracies in the orbital configurations, fluxes, and noise, and determines optimal secondary photometry bands to reduce these. We demonstrate its application by comparing an Earth seen at quadrature with a cold and a warm Neptune at inclined orbits and varying phases, with comparable flux in the discovery bandpass centered at 500 nm (20\% bandwidth). Using the noise and exposure time calculator that we developed for the HWO coronagraph instrument, we find that the baseline $S/N=7$ (corresponding to 3.2 hours observing time for a planet at 10pc) is only sufficient to marginally differentiate the Earth from a cold Neptune-like planet assuming two parallel bandpasses (550 nm + 850 nm). However, increasing to $S/N=15$ (7 hours observing time) and using three parallel bandpasses (360 nm + 500 nm + 1.11 micron) would differentiate the Earth from either a warm or cold Neptune.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> MRI of fixed tissue is an excellent way to study pathological changes caused by different diseases with great anatomical detail. It is, however, known that properties of tissue change with fixation. The aim of this study was to determine the variability of several quantitative MRI (qMRI) parameters in fixed brain tissue obtained from donors unaffected by neurological conditions and to determine which quantitative parameters, if any, vary little between specimens. We introduce a 3D method for high-resolution mapping of water content, T1 and T2* relaxation times and parameters characterising magnetisation transfer and apply it at 3T to 7 whole, fixed human brains (3 male, 4 female, aged between 47 and 79 years, mean age 67 years). The qMRI parameters determined include water content, relaxation rates T1 and T2*, MT ratio and T1 and T2* after MT. From these we can further derive quantitative MT parameters such as the forward exchange rate (ktrans) and bound pool fraction (fbound). Correlations between these parameters are investigated. Quantitative water content determined with MRI is reported on whole human post mortem brains, to our knowledge, for the first time non-invasively. Water content was found to have mean values of 73% for WM and 85% for GM with standard deviation below 2.5% over 7 brains; for comparison, the in vivo values obtained with this method are 69% and 81% for WM and GM, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.15117v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We frame the Painlev\`e mechanical system, which has been extensively studied because of the paradox it generates, within the class of Regular Geometric Impulsive Mechanical Systems (RGIMS), by modeling it as a mechanical system subject to a rough unilateral positional constraint $\cal{S}$, where friction is represented by an instantaneous kinetic constraint $\cal{B}$, internal to $\cal{S}$ and of impulsive nature. The evolution of the system is therefore determined by the choice of a constitutive characterization for these constraints, a choice that restores mechanical determinism and eliminates any paradoxical aspects of the system&#x27;s behavior, in agreement with experimental evidence. It is shown that, similarly to what occurs in general non ideal impulsive systems, the choice of a constitutive characterization of the constraint system depends on the determination of two numerical coefficients $\sigma$ and $\beta$, which depend on the kinematic and mass-related data of the system, and possibly also on physical quantities not strictly of a mechanical nature, such as material properties. The simplicity of the model also allows for a straightforward experimental analysis of the system&#x27;s behavior and for the experimental determination of the values of these coefficients.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2507.08823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Interferometric observations of the low-frequency radio sky ($&lt;$ 1~GHz) are largely limited by systematic effects introduced by the ionosphere. In this study, we use a ten-hour nighttime observation of the bright radio source 3C48, carried out with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), to examine how ionospheric conditions affect radio signals. We focus on measuring phase fluctuations caused by the ionosphere and analyse how these variations change with antenna separation using the spatial phase structure function. Our results, based on data from three sub-bands between 575 and 725~MHz, show a clear power-law trend consistent with turbulent behaviour. We introduce the diffractive scale as a scalar measure of ionospheric conditions, which could guide future calibration strategies. Furthermore, we find that the turbulence is anisotropic, with properties that vary by direction. The smallest diffractive scales do not always align with Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, suggesting the influence of medium-scale Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (MSTIDs). The contribution of these wave-like MSTIDs to the structure function follows a power-law with a slope close to 2.0, indicating their dominant role in shaping the observed anisotropic phase fluctuations.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Computational de novo protein design study creating binders to the human sweet taste receptor TAS1R2 as potential low-calorie sweet proteins, with no direct relevance to origins-of-life or astrobiology topics.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.14574v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Excessive consumption of dietary sugars is a major contributor to metabolic disorders, driving global interest in finding alternative sweeteners with reduced caloric impact. Natural sweet proteins, such as brazzein, offer exceptional sweetness intensity with little caloric contribution. However, their widespread use is limited by restricted natural diversity, low stability, and high production costs. Recent advances in structural biology and de novo protein design provide new opportunities to overcome these limitations through rational engineering. In this study, we report an integrated computational pipeline for the de novo design of protein binders targeting the human sweet taste receptor subunit TAS1R2, a key component of the heterodimeric class C G protein-coupled receptor mediating sweetness perception. The workflow combines diffusion-based backbone generation (RFdiffusion), neural network-guided sequence design (ProteinMPNN), structure-based filtering using Boltz-1, and binding energy evaluation via MM/GBSA calculations. Using the recently resolved cryo-EM structure of the TAS1R2 receptor, protein binders were designed to target both the Venus Flytrap Domain and the cysteine-rich domain of TAS1R2. A few designed binders exhibited favorable structural confidence and predicted binding energetics. In particular, Binder2 exhibited brazzein-like structural plausibility through specific short-range CRD contacts, while Binder1 displayed the strongest predicted binding affinity. Structural analyses of the binder-receptor complex revealed distinct binding modes and secondary structure profiles among the designs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of de novo designing protein binders that emulate key functional properties of natural sweet proteins, establishing a computational framework for the rational development of next-generation protein-based sweeteners.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.01511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: In high-contrast imaging, a novel detection algorithm for angular differential imaging (ADI) sequences has recently been introduced: the Regime Switching Model (RSM). In this study, we apply the RSM algorithm to analyze the F150 sample from the SHINE high-contrast imaging survey carried out with VLT/SPHERE, aiming to enhance detection limits and identify new exoplanet candidates. Additionally, we investigate how environmental conditions influence post-processed noise distributions and detection thresholds. We generate detection maps and contrast curves for 213 observations in the F150 SHINE sample using the RSM algorithm. A clustering approach based on environmental parameters is used to group observations with similar noise characteristics. We propose two methods for defining radial detection thresholds in the RSM maps: fitting a log-normal distribution to the post-processed noise and maximizing the F1 score. We also assess the performance of various combinations of post-processing techniques within the RSM framework to identify optimal configurations. This study demonstrates the utility of clustering based on observational parameters, effectively distinguishing features like wind-driven halos and low-wind effects. Detection thresholds vary significantly across clusters, differing by up to a factor of 10, highlighting the importance of considering observational environments. Log-normal thresholds provide conservative, noise-aware limits, while F1 score-based thresholds offer observation-specific results, both showing compatibility overall. RSM improves detection limits by an average factor of two at 1arcsec and five at inner working angles compared to standard PCA processing. This study reports more than 30 newly detected signals, including one promising candidate awaiting second-epoch confirmation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.14664v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We examine the role of angular momentum in general relativity from both heuristic and fully covariant perspectives, with the aim of clarifying conceptual ambiguities that arise when Newtonian intuition is extrapolated into the relativistic regime. Focusing on free--fall dynamics in the Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes in the test--particle limit, we employ an effective--potential heuristic approach to isolate the roles of the specific energy $E$, specific angular momentum $L$, and black--hole spin $a$. Within this framework, we identify well--defined regions of parameter space in which the Kerr spacetime leads to stronger or weaker local radial infall than the Schwarzschild case at the same radius. By analysing the kinematics of infalling geodesic congruences, we show how these local regimes combine along complete trajectories to either enhance or reduce gravitational focusing. We then interpret these results within a covariant 1+3 description of general relativity, in terms of the expansion, shear and Raychaudhuri evolution of timelike congruences. We demonstrate that black--hole rotation systematically modifies the shear of infalling irrotational flows, even when the magnitude of the local expansion is reduced, and that this shear modulation governs the overall rate of focusing. Our work complements previous studies of relativistic infall by providing a unified energetic and geometric interpretation of how angular momentum and rotation can strengthen or weaken gravitational collapse relative to the non--rotating case.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2509.04944v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Young ($\lesssim 10$ Myr) planetary-mass companions (PMCs) provide valuable insights into the formation and early evolution of planetary systems. To date, only a dozen such objects have been identified through direct imaging. Using JWST/NIRCam observations towards the Orion Nebula, obtained as part of the \textit{PDRs4All} Early Release Science program, we have identified a faint point source near the M-type star V2376 Ori. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the MUSE instrument on the VLT confirm that the source, V2376 Ori b, is indeed a young planetary-mass companion. It is a member of Orion D, around 80\,pc in the foreground of the Trapezium cluster of Orion and with an age of approximately $7 \pm 3$ Myr. We fit the SED of V2376 Ori b to infer a mass of $ \sim 20~M_{\rm Jup}$. The MUSE spectrum reveals several accretion tracers. Based on the H$\alpha$ line intensity, we estimate an accretion rate of $\sim$10$^{-6.5 \pm 0.7}~\rm M_{Jup}\,yr^{-1}$, which is comparable to that of young PMCs such as PDS~70b. In addition, the MUSE data cube reveals extended emission in the [O\,\textsc{ii}] doublet at 7320 and 7330~\AA, which is interpreted as evidence of a dynamical interaction between the two sources that, potentially, involves mass transfer between their individual accretion disks. These results demonstrate that JWST/NIRCam imaging surveys of young stellar associations can uncover new PMCs, which can then be confirmed and characterized through ground-based spectroscopic follow-up.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.14273v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Light driven oxygen formation in Photosystem II protein is a fundamental process that sustains our biosphere and serves as a blue print to future clean energy solutions due to its high energy conversion efficiency. Last decade of intense research by advanced physical techniques delivered new insights on the structure and function of the Mn4CaO5 cluster a center of the oxygen evolving complex (OEC). However, discrepancies in experimental observations and computational models persist impeding the understanding of the O-O bond formation and the role of the protein environment in the process. Here we show that i) assignment of the OEC unique oxygen O3 ligated by histidine (His337) via dynamic H-bond as a slow exchanging substrate and ii) its coupling with O6 oxygen generated at Mn1 in the S2 to S3 transition give the O-O bond formation mechanism most consistent with all currently available experimental data. Proposal shows how protein environment can steer the O-O bond formation by charge control via H-bond and open coordination of Mn1. Obtained O3-O6 peroxide is at lower energy than peroxides in the most studied O5-O6 bond formation pathway. His337 appears to be similar to distal His in globins used for management of the O2 and H2O2 intermediates. The new mechanism breaks the prior impasse and will undoubtedly invigorate future detailed studies uncovering its further details.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.14712v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Field emission coupled with molecular dynamics simulation (FEcMD) software package is a computational tool for studying atomic structure evolution, structural deformation, phase transitions, recrystallization as well as electron emission characteristics of micro- and nano-protrusions and nanowires consisting of elemental metals or multi-component alloys by means of multi-physics and multi-scale methodology. Current implementations of molecular dynamics simulation coupled with multi-scale electrodynamics (ED) and heat conduction (HC) in FEcMD program are advanced mainly in the two aspects as follows. In electrodynamics, the FEcMD program incorporates the space charge interactions (space charge potential and exchange-correlation effects) in the self-consistent solved Poisson-Schr\&quot;odinger equation with Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin-Jeffreys (WKBJ) approximation to evaluate the field emission current density and the related resistive heating process more reliably for nanowires or nano-protrusions especially for nano-gaps between two metal electrodes. Meanwhile, the two-temperature heat conduction model is implemented in electrodynamics coupled with molecular dynamics simulations (ED-MD), providing more dedicated descriptions for the hierarchical electron-phonon two-channel heat conduction mechanism and the temperature evolutions of electron and phonon subsystems under the radiofrequency (RF) or pulse electric fields. Benchmark tests are performed for some key implementations in FEcMD software to validate the numerical results, and also to demonstrate the use of program to study the atomic structure evolution of metal nano-structures under electric field and heating processes.</p>

Straightfoward exact solutions exist when the evolution is described by a linear differential equation, corresponding to constant, linear, and quadratic potentials. In the nonlinear case, exact solutions are derived for $V = V_0\ln \phi$, $V = V_0 \phi^{1/2}$ and $V = V_0/\phi$, and the logarithmic potential also yields an exact first integral. These complicated parametric solutions are considerably less useful than those derived previously for a universe dominated by a barotropic fluid such as matter or radiation with $w_B &gt; -1$. However, we generalize the slow-roll approximation and show that it applies to all sufficiently flat potentials in the case of a vacuum-dominated expansion, while it never applies when the universe is dominated by a background fluid with $w_B &gt; -1$.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.16421v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Characterizing temperate exoplanet atmospheres remains challenging due to their small size and low temperatures. Recent JWST observations provide valuable data, but their interpretation has led to diverging conclusions. Complementary approaches combining laboratory experiments and photochemical modeling are essential for constraining atmospheric chemistry and interpreting observations. We aim to identify chemical pathways governing the formation and evolution of neutral species and to assess their sensitivity to key parameters such as C/O ratio and metallicity. Our approach combines experimental and numerical simulations on H2-rich gas mixtures representative of sub-Neptune atmospheres, spanning a wide range of CH4, CO, and CO2 mixing ratios. A cold plasma reactor simulates out-of-equilibrium upper-atmospheric chemistry. A 0D photochemical model reproduces reactor conditions, guiding interpretation of key pathways and abundance trends. We observe the formation of both reduced and oxidized organic compounds. In CH4-rich mixtures, hydrocarbons form efficiently through methane chemistry, correlating with CH4 concentration and agreeing with models. In more oxidizing environments, particularly CO2-rich mixtures, hydrocarbon formation is inhibited by complex reaction networks and oxidative losses. Oxygen incorporation enhances chemical diversity and promotes formation of oxidized organic compounds of prebiotic interest (H2CO, CH3OH, CH3CHO), especially in atmospheres containing both CH4 and CO2. Atmospheres containing CH4 and CO, which balance carbon and oxygen supply without excessive oxidative destruction, favor efficient production of hydrocarbons and oxidized compounds. Out-of-equilibrium chemistry plays a key role in the diversification and organic complexification of temperate exoplanet atmospheres.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2503.21403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Population genetic processes, such as the adaptation of a quantitative trait to directional selection, may occur on longer time scales than the sweep of a single advantageous mutation. To study such processes in finite populations, approximations for the time course of the distribution of a beneficial mutation were derived previously by branching process methods. The application to the evolution of a quantitative trait requires bounds for the probability of survival $S^{(n)}$ up to generation $n$ of a single beneficial mutation. Here, we present a method to obtain a simple, analytically explicit, either upper or lower, bound for $S^{(n)}$ in a supercritical Galton-Watson process. We prove the existence of an upper bound for offspring distributions including Poisson, binomial, and negative binomial. They are constructed by bounding the given generating function, $\varphi$, by a fractional linear one that has the same survival probability $S^\infty$ and yields the same rate of convergence of $S^{(n)}$ to $S^\infty$ as $\varphi$. For distributions with at most three offspring, we characterize when this method yields an upper bound, a lower bound, or only an approximation. Because for many distributions it is difficult to get a handle on $S^\infty$, we derive an approximation by series expansion in $s$, where $s$ is the selective advantage of the mutant. We briefly review well-known asymptotic results that generalize Haldane&#x27;s approximation $2s$ for $S^\infty$, as well as less well-known results on sharp bounds for $S^\infty$. We apply them to explore when bounds for $S^{(n)}$ exist for a family of generalized Poisson distributions. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy of our and of previously derived bounds for $S^\infty$ and $S^{(n)}$. Finally, as an application we determine the response of a quantitative trait caused by new beneficial mutations to prolonged directional selection.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Proposes a discontinuity-aware physics-informed neural network to more stably and accurately model sharp interfaces and phase change in multiphase phase-field flows (demonstrated up to three-phase droplet icing), a computational advance with only indirect relevance to astrobiology via improved water/ice process modeling.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.23102v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been applied to simulate multiphase flows, yet they are limited in modeling phase changes and sharp interfaces due to optimization conflicts in the strongly coupled Allen-Cahn, Cahn-Hilliard, and Navier-Stokes equations and the intrinsic smoothness bias of neural representations near discontinuities. To mitigate these limitations, this study presents a discontinuity-aware physics-informed neural network (DPINN) based on the phase-field method to resolve sharp interfaces and phase changes in multiphase flows. It incorporates a discontinuity-aware network architecture to mitigate spectral bias and automatically detect and model sharp interfacial dynamics, and a learnable local artificial viscosity term to stabilize the calculation near steep gradients. During optimization, adaptive time-marching and loss-balancing strategies are employed to reduce long-horizon errors and mitigate gradient conflicts, ensuring accurate capture of phase changes. Numerical experiments on two-phase reversed single-vortex and bubble-rising problems demonstrate that DPINN accurately resolves sharp interfacial dynamics, while conventional PINNs fail to converge. The method is further extended and tested in a three-phase droplet-icing case, where the viscosity and density ratios between ice, water, and air exceed seven and three orders of magnitude, respectively. The predicted phase change dynamics and sharp pointy-tip formation show excellent agreement with the reference, highlighting the robustness of the proposed approach.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.13479v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Gas phase ultrafast electron diffraction (GUED) has become a powerful technique to directly observe the structural dynamics of photoexcited molecules. GUED reveals information about the nuclear motions that is complementary to the information on the electronic states provided by spectroscopic measurements. GUED experiments so far have utilized a single laser pulse to excite the molecules and an electron pulse to probe the dynamics. This limits the excited states which can be studied to only those that can be reached by absorption of a photon from the ground state or in some cases simultaneous absorption of multiple photons. A broader class of experiments and dynamics can be accessed using two time-delayed laser pulses to access unexplored regions of the potential energy surfaces. As a proof-of-principle experiment using a double excitation, we studied the photodissociation of trifluoroiodomethane molecules that are pre-excited with an infrared (800 nm) femtosecond laser pulse before photo-dissociation is triggered with an ultraviolet (266 nm) femtosecond laser pulse. We have observed significant differences in the dissociation dynamics, with pre-excitation resulting in a slower dissociation process. This new capability can offer new insights on the evolution of nuclear wavepackets in regions of the excited potential energy surface which are inaccessible in single photon excitation. We present a methodology to carry out the measurement, analyze and interpret the data that could be applied to a broad class of experiments.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.14836v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Understanding ionic transport under strong confinement is crucial for the design of next-generation energy, catalytic, and information-processing materials; however, repeated field-driven ion motion often degrades conventional solid electrolytes. Van der Waals layered materials offer an alternative by providing structurally resilient ion-transport channels, yet the microscopic origins of their nonequilibrium transport behavior remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate field-driven ionic conduction in sodium-intercalated layered MnO$_2$ as a model self-intercalated van der Waals solid, using all-atom nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations that explicitly capture ion-water correlations and layer morphology. We demonstrate that ionic conductivity depends nonlinearly on the applied electric field, interlayer spacing, water content, and lattice flexibility. The applied electric field induces spatial segregation of water coupled to distortions of the MnO$_2$ sheets, producing coexisting regions populated by highly hydrated and weakly hydrated ions with suppressed conductivity. Concurrently, ionic transport exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on the total amount of intercalated water, with boundary domains of weakly hydrated ions displaying relatively higher mobility. In fluctuation-free layers, ion transport transitions from single-particle motion to a collective conduction regime characterized by elongated, same-charge ionic clusters that violate Nernst-Einstein behavior. Together, these findings provide a molecular-level mechanism linking confinement-induced electrostatic correlations and structural response to the emergent nonlinear transport observed experimentally in ion-intercalated MnO$_2$, and suggest general design principles for robust, water-assisted ionic conductors.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.15073v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Proton minibeam (pMB) radiotherapy, delivers highly heterogeneous dose distributions alternating high-dose peaks and low-dose valleys. This aims to widen the therapeutic window by improving normal tissue sparing while maintaining the same or even better tumour control. The performance of pMB strongly depends on the collimator design and physical parameters. To better understand the physical and radiobiological drivers of this enhanced therapeutic window, we perform a detailed microdosimetric characterization of proton minibeams and assess their impact. We characterize radiation quality with microdosimetry through Monte Carlo simulations. Then we extend the Generalized Stochastic Microdosimetric Model to predict the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) at different depths in water, 1cm, 2cm, and 4cm, for 100MeV proton minibeams realized with varying configurations of collimator. Results are compared with conventional homogeneous field (HF) irradiation after dose normalization to the tumor. The developed model is applied by considering tissues as divided into several functional subunits, connected by a seriality parameter. Microdosimetric characterization of proton minibeam irradiation shows differences between peak and valley regions in shaping lineal energy spectra, especially at low depth, while radiation quality uniforms progressively getting closer to the tumor. NTCP calculations results suggest an increased sparing effect for pMB over conventional HF. A strong dependence is found on the peak-to-valley dose ratio (PVDR), and on the seriality parameter. Predictions indicate substantial sparing from pMB, especially for PVDR &gt; 15, including relatively serial organs with seriality around 0.7. This integrated dose-microdosimetric-biological framework elucidates how spatial fractionation, radiation quality, and organ architecture collectively shape tissue sparing in pMB.</p>

In this perspective article, current computer simulations and experimental results are discussed under the light of a suitable theoretical framework. It is found that using a combination of wetting physics, the theory of intermolecular forces, statistical mechanics and out of equilibrium physics a large number of conflicting results can be reconciled and collected into a consistent description of the ice surface. This helps understand the crucial role of surface properties in a range of important applications, from the enigmatic structure of snow crystals to the slipperiness of ice.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.14273v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Light driven oxygen formation in Photosystem II protein is a fundamental process that sustains our biosphere and serves as a blue print to future clean energy solutions due to its high energy conversion efficiency. Last decade of intense research by advanced physical techniques delivered new insights on the structure and function of the Mn4CaO5 cluster a center of the oxygen evolving complex (OEC). However, discrepancies in experimental observations and computational models persist impeding the understanding of the O-O bond formation and the role of the protein environment in the process. Here we show that i) assignment of the OEC unique oxygen O3 ligated by histidine (His337) via dynamic H-bond as a slow exchanging substrate and ii) its coupling with O6 oxygen generated at Mn1 in the S2 to S3 transition give the O-O bond formation mechanism most consistent with all currently available experimental data. Proposal shows how protein environment can steer the O-O bond formation by charge control via H-bond and open coordination of Mn1. Obtained O3-O6 peroxide is at lower energy than peroxides in the most studied O5-O6 bond formation pathway. His337 appears to be similar to distal His in globins used for management of the O2 and H2O2 intermediates. The new mechanism breaks the prior impasse and will undoubtedly invigorate future detailed studies uncovering its further details.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2508.17937v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The small magnitude and long-range character of non-covalent interactions pose a significant challenge for computational quantum chemical and electronic-structure methods alike. State-of-the-art coupled cluster (CC) theory and benchmark-grade diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) are ideally positioned to tackle these problems, but concerning differences between both methods have been reported in numerous studies of the interaction energy of non-covalently bound dimers. Given that the basic theoretical frameworks underpinning both methods are exact in principle, the error must arise from one or several of the approximations required to make the calculations computationally tractable. Here, we carry out a rigorous and systematic examination of the effect of each of these approximations using the acetic acid dimer and water-peptide systems as convenient testing grounds. Thanks to the use of stringently optimized backflow wave functions we are able to find that the significant discrepancies are dominated by the fixed-node error incurred by the Slater-Jastrow DMC result, while errors in the CC calculations do not significantly alter the result. This finding, likely applicable to other hydrogen-bonded systems, helps establish that CC should be regarded as the benchmark for these systems, and can potentially guide the search for pragmatic solutions to the fixed-node problem in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> S9 proteases are widely distributed across the tree-of-life and play essential roles in protein processing. However, the structural and mechanistic basis for protease activity in the S9D subfamily has remained unknown. Here, we report the first high-resolution cryo-EM structures of an S9D protease, chloroplast glutamyl endopeptidase (CGEP) from Arabidopsis thaliana, expressed in plants and bacteria. CGEP adopts a dimeric architecture stabilized by two distinct interfaces: hydrophobic interactions between catalytic domains and an interdomain {beta}-sheet linking the cap and catalytic domains. These interactions create a rigid scaffold that supports a hinge loop, which acts as a steric gate to restrict substrate access and confine catalytic activity to the closed conformation. Unlike S9A-B-C proteases, CGEP maintains an intact catalytic triad in both open and closed states, relying on hinge-loop gating rather than catalytic disruption for regulation. Structural analysis and mutagenesis reveal that the hinge loop forms a conserved pocket favoring glutamate side chains, explaining CGEP&#x27;s strong glutamate preference at cleavage sites. Together, these findings uncover a unique regulatory paradigm for S9D proteases and provide a structural framework for understanding substrate selectivity and dimerization.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding the complex interplay between a host, its diet, and its microbiome is crucial for comprehending an organism&#x27;s health and adaptability. Diet impacts both the host and microbiome, which then influence each other. We used black soldier fly larvae (Hermetia illucens) as a model to investigate this tripartite interaction due to its resilience and bioconversion capabilities. We analyzed life-history traits and metatranscriptomics in larvae fed three diets: carbohydrate-rich, protein-rich, and balanced. Our results showed that dietary macronutrients correlated with shifts in the microbial community and gene expression. The carbohydrate-rich diet, in particular, led to increased microbial diversity and carbohydrate metabolism transcripts. However, this diet also negatively affected larval weight and development, suggesting potential host control over the microbiome. Overall, black soldier fly performance was highest on the balanced diet. This study highlights the black soldier fly&#x27;s resilience and its value as a model for exploring host-diet-microbe interactions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> 6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenases (6PGDHs) catalyze a key oxidative step in the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP), a route essential for NAD(P)H generation and carbon metabolism in bacteria and eukaryotes. While the structural basis of substrate recognition is well established for long-chain dimeric 6PGDHs, the mechanisms used by short-chain tetrameric enzymes remain poorly defined. Here, we present a 2.0 [A] crystal structure of tetrameric 6PGDH from Gluconobacter oxydans (Go6PGDH) in complex with 6-phosphogluconate (6PG) and integrate it with evolutionary, computational, and functional analyses. The structure shows that, unlike dimeric homologs, tetrameric Go6PGDH does not undergo a domain-closure transition upon ligand binding. Instead, 6PG induces a compaction of the tetramer mediated by two conserved C-terminal elements: an inter-protomer ionic &#x27;&#x27;lock&#x27;&#x27; and an intra-subunit C-terminal &#x27;&#x27;latch&#x27;&#x27; that together stabilize a closed catalytic pocket. Molecular-dynamics simulations identify His328 as a central residue that couples C-terminal tail closure to direct ligand coordination, and mutagenesis analysis confirms its essential role in catalytic efficiency. Thermodynamic measurements reveal that 6PG binding is strongly enthalpy-driven, consistent with the formation of an ordered hydrogen-bonding and electrostatic network in the closed conformation. These findings define a substrate-induced quaternary-tightening mechanism unique to tetrameric 6PGDHs and illustrate how a conserved C-terminal module has been adapted across the family to regulate substrate binding and catalysis.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> FastSpeciesTree is a fast, scalable automated pipeline for inferring large species trees from genomic/proteome datasets, enabling broad evolutionary “tree of life” analyses but not directly addressing origins-of-life or prebiotic processes.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The generation of species trees from genomic data is an important step in understanding evolutionary relationships across the tree of life. With the increasing availability of genomic data, species tree inference methods which can easily and rapidly produce accurate species trees from large datasets are required to enable downstream analyses of these resources. Here we present FastSpeciesTree, a fully automated species tree inference method designed to leverage advances in rapid pairwise sequence alignment and scalable phylogenetic inference methods. We show that FastSpeciesTree is able to produce species trees with accuracies equivalent to trees produced through manual-curation and best-practice approaches. We further demonstrate that FastSpeciesTree can produce these high accuracy phylogenies substantially faster than any competitor method. Finally, we show that FastSpeciesTree is capable of building a species tree comprising almost the entirety of the RefSeq databases available proteomes (n = 33285) in less than 12 hours using standard computing resources. FastSpeciesTree is executed as a single command and can be found at https://github.com/OrthoFinder/FastSpeciesTree.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study dissects calcineurin/BRG1 chromatin-remodeling control of Tceal7 during mammalian myoblast differentiation, with no direct connection to origins-of-life, prebiotic chemistry, or astrobiology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The transcriptional control of skeletal muscle differentiation requires the coordinated activity of lineage-defining transcription factors, signal-responsive regulators, chromatin modifiers, and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling enzymes. Here, we identify TCEAL7, a member of the X-linked, poorly characterized TCEAL family of proteins, as a direct downstream target of Brg1-containing mammalian SWI/SNF (mSWI/SNF) complexes and calcineurin signaling during myoblast differentiation. Analyses of previously published datasets showed that pharmacological inhibition of mSWI/SNF bromodomains or knockdown of the Brg1 ATPase, but not knockdown of the homologue Brm ATPase, significantly reduced Tceal7 expression in differentiating C2C12 myoblasts. We demonstrate that BRG1 occupancy at the Tceal7 promoter increased during differentiation, paralleling the induction of Tceal7 expression and nuclear accumulation of TCEAL7 protein. BRG1 functions in part by integrating calcium-dependent cues via the phosphatase calcineurin (Cn); we also determined that Cn knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of Cn suppressed Tceal7 expression and impaired myoblast differentiation. The data suggest that both Brg1-driven chromatin remodeling and Cn signaling converge on Tceal7 regulation. Functionally, Tceal7 knockdown altered cell proliferation and disrupted myoblast differentiation, at least in part due to reduced expression of Myogenin, which encodes a transcription factor that is an essential differentiation determinant. RNA-seq analysis revealed broad dysregulation of myogenic, metabolic, and cell-cycle gene programs in Tceal7-deficient cells, including changes in cyclin-dependent kinase-regulated pathways consistent with prior reports linking TCEAL7 to cell-cycle control. Together, these findings identify TCEAL7 as a necessary component of the myogenic regulatory network whose expression is controlled by BRG1-dependent chromatin remodeling and Cn activity.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> ANKLE2 is an enigmatic protein with emerging roles in cell division, development, and virus replication. While ANKLE2 orthologs are present in all animals, its domain composition has evolved over time. ANKLE2&#x27;s two namesake domains, the ankyrin repeat and LEM domains, have clear and defined roles; however nearly all ANKLE2 orthologs have at least three other structured domains with poorly understood purposes. In this study, we performed sequence and structural alignments of ANKLE2 orthologs to improve our understanding of the protein&#x27;s evolution and function. We identified that ANKLE2&#x27;s transmembrane domain likely evolved more recently and coincided with loss of VAPA interaction as a membrane anchoring mechanism. We show that despite stark differences in amino acid sequence, the structure of the LEM and ankyrin repeat domains are highly conserved across ANKLE2 orthologs. To investigate ANKLE2&#x27;s uncharacterized domains, we performed structural alignments to identify similar proteins. This revealed surprising similarities between portions of ANKLE2 and nuclease or nucleic acid-binding proteins. However, ANKLE2 lacks key motifs imparting function in these domains, which was confirmed by experimental interrogation. We further identified that loss of ANKLE2 is correlated with changes in DNA damage response and micronuclei formation. We believe this methodology demonstrates the power of combining structural predictions with classical molecular techniques in exploring poorly understood proteins.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Group I Introns are non-coding regions of pre-mRNA that catalyze their splicing from the RNA sequence by folding to a specific structure. We used computer simulations to study the folding mechanism of the P4-P6 domain in the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron, focusing on the GAAA tetraloop-receptor (TL-R) interaction, which is a ubiquitous tertiary interaction in RNA structures. We show that the intron folds via a multistep pathway, populating seven states with distinct tertiary contacts. Under physiological Mg2+ concentrations ([Mg2+]), the loop-bulge-P4 tertiary interaction is essential to stabilize the docked TL-R complex, whereas in high [Mg2+], the TL-R complex is stable by itself. The solvated Mg2+ ions modulate the TL-R docking-undocking dynamics and stabilize non-native intermediate states. The condensation of Mg2+ in the major grooves of the TL and R helices is critical for them to attain specific stiffness essential for their facile docking. The results highlight the critical role of Mg2+ ions in facilitating TL-R interaction formation, which stabilizes long-range tertiary contacts in RNA structures.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Meta-analysis in birds finds carotenoid-based ornamental coloration predicts survival in males but not females, suggesting sex-specific selection on these traits.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many vertebrates exhibit colourful ornaments generated by carotenoid pigments that presumably evolve as signals under sexual selection. To function as sexual signals, carotenoid-based coloured ornaments should accurately reveal an individual&#x27;s quality, commonly defined as fitness potential, which includes the ability to survive. We performed a meta-analysis for testing the association between the expression level of carotenoid-based ornaments and longevity estimates (annual survival or lifespan) in birds, the taxon with the largest body of evidence. We detected a significant positive correlation in males but not in females. This result contrasts with recent meta-analytic work showing a positive association between carotenoid-based coloured traits and avian fecundity in both sexes. The link to survival was consistent among colourations produced by enzymatically transformed pigments (mostly red ketocarotenoids) and those based on dietary yellow carotenoids. The latter suggests that the association with survival holds across the physiological mechanisms involved in the production of these ornaments. In summary, our study reveals sex-specific selection in the evolution of carotenoid-based ornaments.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tandem repeats (TRs) are highly mutable DNA elements that comprise nearly 8% of the human genome and influence gene regulation, protein coding, and disease. Despite their functional importance, our understanding of TR evolution remains limited, as their repetitive nature has hindered accurate sequencing, annotation, and cross-species comparison. As a result, we lack a population-aware evolutionary framework to quantify TR conservation, divergence, and mutational dynamics across species. Here, using telomere-to-telomere (T2T) reference genomes for seven ape species and population-scale long reads for humans and chimpanzees, we generated a comprehensive comparative catalog of STRs and VNTRs. We identified over 3 million TR loci per ape genome and nearly 2 million homologous loci between humans and chimpanzees. TR diversity and conservation are strongly structured by genomic context, with coding and untranslated regions exhibiting reduced polymorphism and divergence, while intronic and intergenic regions show elevated variability. Heterozygosity varies systematically across species, motif lengths, and functional categories, and mutation rates show strong concordance between indirect and pedigree-based estimates. Using a divergence-diversity ratio framework, we identified TRs under extreme evolutionary regimes that are enriched in genes involved in nervous system development, synaptic function, and cell signaling. Together, these results establish a population and species-resolved framework for studying TR evolution and interpreting TR variation in functional contexts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Microbial mutualists partially determine many host traits, including traits related to infection by parasites. However, while microbial effects on host trait plasticity is fairly well established, whether microbial mutualists contribute to genetic variation in infection-related remains an open question . Here we paired 10 mutualistic Sinorhizobium meliloti rhizobacteria strains with 20 Medicago truncatula plant genotypes in an incomplete factorial design, and experimentally infected the plants with parasitic root-knot nematodes. We used this design to estimate rhizobia contributions to genetic variation in four infection-related traits: host resistance, parasite virulence, host tolerance, and mutualism robustness. We find that rhizobia contribute to genetic variation in host resistance and mutualism robustness, and to genetic variation in parasite virulence via genotype-by-genotype interactions with the host. Rhizobia did not contribute to variation in host tolerance. The influence of rhizobia strains on parasite resistance was partially explained by their effect on host root growth. These results underscores the influence that microbial mutualists have on their host&#x27;s response to parasite infection, and suggests that resource mutualists may impact host-parasite evolution.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a PCA-enhanced concept-attribution method (TPCAV) to interpret deep learning genomics models, improving global biological concept interpretation and motif analysis but with limited direct relevance to origins-of-life research beyond general DNA model interpretability.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Interpreting genomics deep learning models remains challenging. Existing feature attribution methods largely focus on scoring individual bases or extracting global DNA motifs from one-hot encoded inputs, leaving them unable to assess broader genomic features such as chromatin accessibility or sequence annotations. Concept attribution methods offer an input-agnostic global interpretation framework, yet they have not been systematically applied to interpret neural network applications in genomics. We present the first application of concept attribution to interpret genomics deep learning models by adapting the Testing with Concept Activation Vectors (TCAV) method. We introduce Testing with PCA-projected Concept Activation Vectors (TPCAV), which improves upon the original method by using a PCA-based decorrelation transformation to address the correlated and redundant embedding features common in genomics models. We also introduce a strategy for extracting concept-specific input attribution maps. We evaluate our approach by interpreting influential biological concepts across a diverse set of genomics models spanning multiple input representations and prediction tasks. We demonstrate that TPCAV provides more reliable DNA motif interpretation than TCAV and is comparable to TF-MoDISco on one-hot coded DNA-based transcription factor binding prediction models. Beyond motif interpretation, TPCAV enables robust interpretive analysis of more general concepts such as repetitive elements and chromatin accessibility and generalizes to tokenized foundation models as well as models incorporating chromatin signal inputs. We further show that TPCAV can identify representative transcription factor binding sites associated with specific concepts, motivating downstream investigation of distinct binding mechanisms.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a Rust-backed Python library for fast, parallel encoding of DNA/RNA sequences into numerical features for machine-learning pipelines, offering improved bioinformatics preprocessing performance but limited direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Background: The ever-growing amount of available biological data leads modern analysis to be performed on large datasets. Unfortunately, bioinformatics tools for preprocessing and analyzing data are not always designed to treat such large amounts of data efficiently. Notably, this is the case when encoding DNA and RNA sequences into numerical representations, also called descriptors, before passing them to machine learning models. Furthermore, current Python tools available for this preprocessing step are not well suited to be integrated into pipelines resulting in slow encoding speeds. Results: We introduce dna-parser, a Python library written in Rust to encode DNA and RNA sequences into numerical features. The combination of Rust and Python allows to encode sequences rapidly and in parallel across multiple threads while maintaining compatibility with packages from the Python ecosystem. Moreover, this library implements many of the most widely used types of numerical feature schemes coming from bioinformatics and natural language processing. Conclusion: dna-parser is an easy to install Python library that offers many Python wheels for Linux (muslinux and manylinux), macOS, and Windows via pip (https://pypi.org/project/dna- parser/). The open source code is available on GitHub (https://github.com/Mvila035/dna_parser) along with the documentation (https://mvila035.github.io/dna_parser/documentation/).</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Mouse/human oocyte–cumulus proteomics identifies translation, autophagy/endocytosis, and ROS/metabolic pathway differences linked to oocyte developmental competence, but the work is largely outside origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Abstract Study question: Which proteins underpin oocyte developmental competence, as modelled by oocytes of variable competence matured in vivo, or matured in vitro under different conditions (capacitation in vitro maturation (CAPA) or standard in vitro maturation (IVM))? Summary answer: Significant differences in the global proteome were observed in both oocytes and their corresponding cumulus cells depending on the mode of oocyte maturation, with key variations in eukaryotic translation, autophagy and endocytosis pathways within oocytes, and changes in reactive oxygen species detoxification and serine biosynthesis in cumulus cells. What is known already: Within the ovarian follicle, mammalian oocytes must acquire the necessary molecular machinery to support successful fertilisation and embryonic development. Close contact with the surrounding cumulus cells ensures coordinated nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation of the oocyte, along with the accumulation of proteins stored within the oocyte in cytoplasmic lattices and endo-lysosomal vesicular assemblies. Study design, size, duration: This basic science study utilised a mouse model to assess proteomic changes across three oocyte competence models. Key proteins identified in mouse oocytes were also assessed in discarded immature human germinal vesicle (GV) oocytes and MII oocytes following rescue-IVM. Three oocyte maturation methods were tested: i) in vivo maturation, (ii) CAPA and (iii) standard IVM. In vivo maturation served as a positive control group, whereby metaphase II (MII) mature oocytes were collected from mice stimulated with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) and triggered with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), simulating full ovarian stimulation. For the in vitro maturation groups, immature cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were collected from mildly stimulated (23 hr PMSG) mice. For the standard IVM group, immature COCs were matured in media containing amphiregulin and epiregulin for 18 hours. For the CAPA group, COCs were held for 24 hours in pre-IVM conditions in the presence of c-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), oestradiol, insulin and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and then matured via IVM in media containing FSH, amphiregulin and epiregulin. Four biological replicates were performed for mouse proteomics experiments, three biological replicates performed for mouse immunocytochemistry experiments and six replicates were performed for embryology experiments. Participants/materials, settings, methods: Four to six-week-old C57BL/6JAusb mice were used for all mouse experiments. Embryology outcomes were used to confirm the variation in oocyte developmental competence between the three maturation groups. For the in vivo, CAPA and IVM groups, mature MII COCs were collected and separated into oocytes and cumulus cells. Oocytes and cumulus cells were subjected to mass spectrometry and bioinformatic analysis was performed using Proteome Discoverer and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, with data validated by immunofluorescence. To assess conservation of proteins in human oocytes, 49 oocytes were collected from 36 patients following assisted reproduction technology (ART) cycles and subject to immunofluorescence. Rescue-IVM was also performed with half of the human oocyte cohort to obtain MII oocytes. Main results and the role of chance: Proteomic profiling identified around 1600 proteins in mouse oocytes and 3100 in mouse cumulus cells across all three treatment groups (at least 2 peptides per protein). Differential expression analysis and pattern analysis collectively revealed a signature of proteins that were consistently differentially expressed between in vivo and in vitro oocyte maturation systems (log2FC of +/- 1 and a p-value [≤] 0.05). These subsets of proteins were mapped to biological processes including eukaryotic translation, autophagy and endocytosis pathways within oocytes. Orthogonal validation of clathrin, ribosomal protein L24 and eukaryotic initiation factor 2A supported the proteomic findings and expression was conserved in human oocytes. Changes in reactive oxygen species detoxification and serine biosynthesis were observed in mouse cumulus cells, with fluorescence intensity changes in ferredoxin-1 and phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase supporting the dysregulation of cumulus cell processes during in vitro maturation. Large scale data: The mass spectrometry data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD073269. Limitations, reasons for caution: The foundational mechanisms of oocyte developmental competence remain elusive, particularly in humans where MII oocytes are heterogenous in quality within the same stimulation cycle and patient. In this study, C57Bl6/J mice were used as the model species, allowing precise control over differing models of oocyte quality and capacity to analyse large numbers of oocytes. However, care is required when interpreting the significance of these findings in mice to mechanisms regulating human oocyte quality. Nonetheless, the in vivo stimulation and both IVM protocols used in this study are clinically relevant and developmentally matched. This study has also not addressed oocyte developmental competence in gonadotropin-free IVM oocytes, which is now a clinical reality. Wider implications of the findings: This study confirms that mouse oocytes, matured in vitro in two clinically relevant systems, show reduced developmental competence when compared to in vivo matured oocytes. Through examination of the global proteome in oocytes, molecular pathways including eukaryotic translation, autophagy and endocytosis were dysregulated in in vitro oocytes. Recent findings have revealed the critical role of these pathways to developmental competence in the context of in vivo development. In cumulus cells, changes in reactive oxygen species detoxification and serine biosynthesis were observed, adding to the extensive knowledge around metabolic activity in cumulus cells as a critical facet of oocyte quality. Combined, this data suggests that the necessary processes of protein storage and degradation in oocytes and metabolism in cumulus cells constitute important components of oocyte quality. These processes appear suboptimal in current IVM systems, providing a future research direction to optimise IVM protocols with consideration to these protein pathways.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Motivation: Cancer progression is driven by the stochastic accumulation of interacting genetic alterations, and tumors from different tissues can share common evolutionary patterns despite distinct anatomical origins. While simplified progression models can be applied at scale, the use of expressive models that capture complex inter-event dependencies remains challenging in pan-cancer settings due to their computational demands. Results: We present fastMHN, a scalable approximation to Mutual Hazard Network-based cancer progression models, that enables pan-cancer analysis of large genomic datasets with the explicit aim of enabling transfer of progression mechanisms across tumor entities. Applying fastMHN to a large clinical cohort, we identify a tumor-progression group spanning multiple tissues that is characterized by a link between STK11 mutations and poor patient survival. While the clinical relevance of STK11 mutations is well established in non-small cell lung cancer, our results suggest that a similar progression mechanism is present in molecularly defined subgroups of other cancer types. These findings illustrate how scalable pan-cancer progression modeling can facilitate cross-entity transfer of biological and potentially clinical insights.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protozoan parasites cause major infectious diseases and pose persistent challenges to global health, particularly the emergence of drug resistant strains. Tandem repeats (TRs) and other repetitive architectures are widespread in proteomes, especially in protozoan proteins, where they have been implicated in host parasite interactions, immune evasion, and antigenicity. However, repeat containing proteins (RPs) exhibit highly diverse architectures that often extend beyond the simple reiteration of a single motif, making comprehensive and quantitative characterization challenging. In this study, we performed bioinformatics analysis of repeat architectures in protozoan proteins. In addition to the established repeat detection approaches, we developed a new algorithm, Drepper, which quantifies repeat architecture complexity. By integrating diverse repeat related features, we clustered RPs across species and identified distinct groups associated with parasite lineages. Notably, we detected a Plasmodium specific RP cluster and a Trypanosoma/Leishmania specific RP cluster; both were characterized by large repeat regions but exhibited contrasting repeat structure complexity. The Plasmodium specific RPs showed high complexity, whereas the Trypanosoma/Leishmania specific RPs displayed significantly low complexity. Functional enrichment analyses indicated that these lineage associated clusters were enriched in parasite specific factors. Furthermore, evolutionary analyses suggested that low complexity repeat architectures may be actively maintained through concerted evolution. Taken together, our results reveal lineage specific strategies in protozoan repeat architectures and provide a quantitative framework for studying their biological and evolutionary roles.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Keywords matched:</strong> RNA, DNA</p>
<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Single-molecule optical tweezers show that high–molecular-weight PEG crowding strongly enhances internucleosomal interactions and chromatin compaction (requiring ~30 pN to disrupt), a eukaryotic DNA-packaging biophysics result with only indirect relevance to origins-of-life.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Molecular crowding causes the compaction of chromatin fibers, contributing to the formation of the nuclear architecture. However, the molecular mechanism of compaction under crowded conditions is not yet fully understood. In this study, we employed the single-molecule optical tweezer method to investigate the effect of molecular crowding on chromatin structure. Force-extension experiments on a 12-mer polynucleosome in the presence of different sizes and concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a crowding agent showed that at low concentrations of low-molecular-weight (MW) PEG, the compaction of the polynucleosome was not significant. In this respect, nucleosomes predominantly remained separated, while DNA-histone interactions within individual nucleosomes were slightly stabilized. In contrast, high concentrations of high-MW PEG significantly promote internucleosomal interactions, leading to highly compact polynucleosome conformations. Under these conditions, approximately 30 pN of force was required to disrupt the internucleosomal interactions and release DNA; this force was 36% higher than that required for DNA unwrapping in the absence of PEG. These findings suggest that molecular crowding impacts cellular processes by mechanically regulating chromatin accessibility for regulatory proteins and the passage of motor molecules such as RNA polymerase.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> by Qi Jiang, Longquan Li, Lei Zhang, Lin Wan The advent of temporal single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data has enabled in-depth investigation of dynamic processes in heterogeneous multicellular systems. Despite remarkable advancements in computational methods for modeling cellular dynamics, integrating cell-cell interactions (CCIs) into these models remains a major challenge. This is particularly true when dealing with high-dimensional gene expression profiles from large populations of interacting cells, where the intricate interplay between cells can be obscured by data complexity. To address this, we present scIMF, a single-cell deep-generative Interacting Mean Field model that learns collective multicellular dynamics. Leveraging the McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equation framework, scIMF provides a mathematical foundation for describing interacting multicellular systems, where each cell’s evolution depends on the population’s empirical distribution. By incorporating a cell-wise attention mechanism, the model efficiently captures nonlocal and asymmetric CCIs, enabling realistic reconstruction of complex intercellular relationships in high-dimensional spaces. Benchmarking across diverse temporal scRNA-seq datasets demonstrates that scIMF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing gene expression at unobserved time points and in inferring cellular velocities. Furthermore, scIMF uncovers biologically interpretable, non-reciprocal interaction patterns of cells, providing a principled framework for studying complex, particularly non-equilibrium biological systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Doxorubicin remains a mainstay of cancer therapy, yet its clinical use is constrained by severe cardiotoxicity, classically attributed to cardiomyocyte death. Here, we identify endothelial inflammation driven by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) turnover and release as a critical mediator of doxorubicin-induced cardiac injury. In vivo, a standard doxorubicin regimen activates the cGAS-STING innate immune pathway in endothelial cells before cardiomyocyte dysfunction or death occurs. Mechanistically, doxorubicin recruits the stress-inducible ribonucleotide reductase subunit RRM2B (p53R2) that normally sustains the mitochondrial deoxyribonucleotide pool, to promote aberrant mtDNA turnover and release, fuelling sterile inflammation. The FDA-approved BAX inhibitor Eltrombopag suppresses mtDNA release, attenuates endothelial inflammation, and prevents doxorubicin cardiotoxicity in vivo without compromising anticancer efficacy. These findings reveal an unrecognized proinflammatory role of RRM2B and establish endothelial inflammation as a central driver of chemotherapy-related cardiac injury, identifying the cardiac endothelium as a tractable target for cardioprotection during cancer treatment.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Computational dissection of ligand binding thermodynamics/kinetics and gating in an ancestral insect odorant receptor (MhOR5), highlighting distinct binding pathways and key residues/helix features that control specificity and dissociation.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Insect olfactory receptors (ORs) are unique ligand-gated ion channels specialized in detecting volatile molecules. The ancestral M. hrabei MhOR5 operates independently of the Orco co-receptor and exhibits broad ligand-binding capacity, yet the molecular underpinnings of its ligand specificity and gating dynamics have long remained unclear. To resolve this knowledge gap, we applied an integrated molecular dynamics enhanced sampling approach, combining collective variable machine learning, alchemical free energy calculations, and kinetic calculations, to dissect the ligand recognition and gating mechanisms of MhOR5 in complex with two key ligands: eugenol (EOL) and DEET. Our findings reveal striking differences in the binding modes of EOL and DEET, identify dual ligand binding/release pathways (solvent-facing and membrane-facing), and pinpoint two critical molecular determinants: W158 as a central gating residue regulating ligand dissociation, and a proline-disrupted S4 helix that modulates ligand specificity via water-mediated hydrogen bonding with DEET. Thermodynamic and kinetic calculations further demonstrate that DEET binds MhOR5 substantially more stably (-11.2 kcal/mol vs. -8.4 kcal/mol for EOL) and associates marginally faster, while EOL dissociates two to three orders of magnitude more rapidly. Collectively, these findings elucidate the atomic-level mechanisms of MhOR5&#x27;s ligand recognition and gating, providing a foundational framework for understanding insect OR function.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> High-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled the generation of high-quality reference genomes for numerous rice cultivars. However, inferring gene functions, associated phenotypes, and causal variants from these sequences remains challenging. The Rice Annotation Project Database (RAP-DB; https://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp) is a curated genomic resource that provides comprehensive gene annotations for the reference genome of Oryza sativa ssp. japonica cv. &quot;Nipponbare.&quot; Since its major update in 2013, gene models and functional annotations have been continuously revised through expert manual curation of newly published literature related to rice genes. As of March 2025, a total of 6,631 transcripts corresponding to 6,371 loci have been curated based on 4,699 peer-reviewed publications. These curated genes are functionally characterized and are frequently associated with agronomic traits, including yield components, stress tolerance, and disease resistance. To support molecular breeding, RAP-DB now provides a curated catalogue of 904 agronomically important loci, including gene symbols, functional descriptions, and associated traits, together with more than 1,000 functionally characterized alleles compiled from the literature. In addition to in-house expert curation, RAP-DB integrates community-curated datasets for major gene families, such as WRKY transcription factors, S-domain receptor-like kinases, and leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors, thereby expanding coverage of key regulatory and defense-related genes. RAP-DB also incorporates reanalyzed RNA sequencing expression profiles alongside microarray-based expression data and co-expression networks, offering gene-centric views of expression patterns across tissues, conditions, and developmental stages. Furthermore, RAP-DB is linked to genome-wide variation datasets from diverse rice varieties through the TASUKE+ genome browser, enabling exploration of allelic diversity across varieties. To enhance annotation quality and long-term sustainability, AI-assisted literature screening and a web-based feedback system have been introduced, allowing users to submit corrections to gene models and report newly characterized genes or relevant publications. Together, these developments strengthen RAP-DB as a primary, literature-based gene annotation resource and provide a practical foundation for molecular breeding in rice.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study benchmarks enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics methods for accurately estimating RNA tetraloop folding free energies, providing practical guidance for improving RNA force-field validation relevant to RNA stability questions in RNA-world scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Biologically functional RNAs operate near marginal stability, and their rugged free-energy landscapes and profound structural dynamics - typically not captured by structural biology experiments - play decisive roles. Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide a unique means to characterize these features. However, the applicability of atomistic MD is currently limited by accessible simulation timescales and, most importantly, by force-field (FF) accuracy. Folding free energies ({Delta}G{degrees}fold) of small RNA motifs represent well-defined targets for quantitative benchmarking of RNA FFs. In practice, however, obtaining thermodynamic estimates that are sufficiently robust for direct comparison with experimental data remains highly challenging, even for small RNA systems, and many published studies rely on sampling that is not fully converged. Here, we systematically assess the performance of widely used advanced enhanced-sampling techniques using the 8-mer r(gcGAGAgc) tetraloop as a representative benchmark system. We test temperature replica exchange (T-REMD), two solute-tempering variants of replica exchange (REST2 and REHT), as well as well-tempered metadynamics and on-the-fly probability enhanced sampling combined with solute tempering (ST-MetaD and ST-OPES). Among the tested approaches, T-REMD proves to be the most robust, yielding reproducible folding equilibria and consistent estimates of {Delta}G{degrees}fold after approximately 20 s of simulation time, independent of the initial folded or unfolded conformational ensemble. Our results provide practical guidelines for selecting sampling protocols suitable for quantitative RNA benchmarks and lay the foundation for systematic validation and future refinement of RNA FFs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Invasively migrating cells thread their nucleus through confined interstitial spaces. How cells protect the nucleus from intracellular forces is poorly understood. Here, we show that the septin cytoskeleton buffers the actomyosin forces that power nuclear movement. Septin filaments comprising SEPT9, a septin amplified in breast cancer, align with perinuclear actomyosin cables which exhibit higher tensile stress during 3D confined migration through narrower pores. SEPT9 depletion amplifies actin stress during confined migration and after myosin II hyper-activation in non-migrating cells causing actin and nuclear envelope ruptures. Following confined migration, DNA breaks, nuclear blebs, micronuclei and cell death increase in SEPT9-depleted cells, phenotypes rescued by the oncogenic SEPT9 isoform 1. Clinicogenomic data reveal that SEPT9 amplification associates with lower genomic alteration in aggressive breast tumors and higher patient mortality. We propose that septins are a mechanoprotective element of the cytoskeleton, and SEPT9 amplification enhances tumor cell survival by preventing nuclear damage.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Throughout eukaryotes, the synaptonemal complex (SC) is a supramolecular structure essential for meiotic chromosome dynamics and sexual reproduction. While metazoan SC proteins display significant sequence divergence, the lack of functional analyses beyond bilaterian models has obscured a mechanistic understanding of SC evolution. Here we report that the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis exhibits synapsis of homologous chromosomes in a classic zipper-like manner and expresses eight orthologs of ten known vertebrate SC proteins. Surprisingly, mutagenesis of the core SC components sycp1, syce2, and sycp3 resulted in divergent and sexually dimorphic phenotypes, indicating the functional diversification of these conserved factors. Combined, these findings challenge the assumption that the conservation of protein sequence or ultrastructure implies mechanistic homology.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Single-cell and clonal analyses in zebrafish identify cxcl18b-marked Müller glia transitional states where Nos2b-derived nitric oxide (a redox signal) is required for injury-induced cell-cycle re-entry and retinal regeneration.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In lower vertebrates, retinal Müller glia (MG) exhibit a life-long capacity of cell-cycle re-entry to regenerate neurons following the retinal injury. However, the mechanism driving such injury-induced MG cell-cycle re-entry remains incompletely understood. Combining single-cell transcriptomic analysis and in vivo clonal analysis, we identified previously undescribed cxcl18b -defined MG transitional states as essential routes toward MG proliferation following green/red cone (G/R cone) ablation. Inflammation blockage abolished the triggering of these transitional states, which expressed the gene modules shared by cells of the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ), where life-long adult neurogenesis takes place. Functional studies of the redox properties of these transitional states further demonstrated the regulatory role of nitric oxide (NO) produced by Nos2b in injury-induced MG proliferation. Finally, we developed a viral-based strategy to specifically disrupt nos2b in cxcl18b -defined MG transitional states and revealed the effect of transitional state-specific NO signaling. Our findings elucidate the precision redox mechanism underlying injury-induced MG cell-cycle re-entry, providing insights into species-specific mechanisms for vertebrate retina regeneration.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study dissects cis- versus trans-driven human–chimp DNA methylation divergence across cell types and links some lineage-specific promoter methylation shifts to selection on pathways tied to human traits, offering evolutionary epigenetics context but minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The vast collection of human-specific traits-- such as our unique morphology, cognition, behavior, and diseases-- has long been attributed to gene expression divergence between us and our closest living relatives, chimpanzees. Theory suggests that changes to cis-regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers may drive evolutionary adaptation, and DNA methylation is a key factor in transcriptional cis-regulation. However, we still lack an understanding of 1) how species-specific methylation patterns arise; 2) their downstream effects; and 3) whether they are a common target of natural selection. In this study, we investigated these three questions. By combining a novel hypothesis testing framework with DNA methylation data from six human and chimpanzee cell types, as well as fused interspecies hybrid cells, we disentangled cis- vs. trans-acting methylation divergence across the genome. Across cell types, we found that methylation divergence is primarily driven in cis, which can be linked in some cases to nearby sequence variants such as CpG gains and losses. Although less common, regions with trans-acting methylation divergence were enriched for specific transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, suggesting a role of TFs such as FOXM1 in these differences. Having established these causes of methylation divergence, we then examined the functional consequences of differential methylation. Although methylation lacks a consistent relationship with transcription, we observed that associations between methylation and gene expression are stronger for genes with cis-regulatory divergence. Moreover, we identified lineage-specific selection shaping promoter methylation at the level of entire pathways including those affecting human-specific traits such as speech, cognition, and susceptibility to infection with hepatitis C. Collectively, our findings provide a mechanistic framework suggesting that DNA methylation may occupy a key position, mediating the effects of both cis- and trans-acting factors on transcriptional networks, including those contributing to human-specific traits.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study dissects how the RNA-binding protein FMRP boosts translation of m6A-modified, codon-biased DGKκ mRNA to regulate neuronal proteostasis in Fragile X syndrome, offering only tangential relevance to origins-of-life questions via general principles of RNA-mediated translational control.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common inherited form of intellectual disability and autism, arises from loss of the RNA-binding protein FMRP. How FMRP loss disrupts neuronal proteostasis remains incompletely understood. Here we identify diacylglycerol kinase kappa (DGK{kappa}) as a principal FMRP mRNA target across the brain. FMRP deficiency markedly reduces neuronal DGK{kappa}, and selective DGK{kappa} loss recapitulates key FXS phenotypes, including hyperactivity and compulsive behaviors, aberrant dendritic spine morphology, and elevated translation. Mechanistically, FMRP binds repetitive DGK{kappa} RNA motifs enriched in N6 methyladenosine (m6A) modifications. These interactions relieve a translational blockade imposed by the encoded amino acid composition, thereby enhancing DGK{kappa} synthesis. Our findings establish DGK{kappa} as a critical mediator of FMRP function and reveal a general mechanism by which FMRP couples m6A modified, codon biased sequences to efficient translation. This work uncovers a regulatory axis linking RNA modification, codon usage, and neuronal proteostasis, illuminating new principles of translational control in neurodevelopmental disorders.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces an LD-scaled association statistic (F&#x27;) that boosts power and robustness of genotype–environment selection scans under complex population structure, validated in simulations and stickleback adaptation datasets.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding the genetic basis of adaptive evolution is central to predicting how populations respond to environmental change. Genome scans and genotype-environment association methods are widely used to detect loci under selection, but because they often ignore correlations among loci (linkage disequilibrium, LD), their power decreases with increasing genetic structuring and demographic complexity. While LD contains valuable information about selection and can reduce dimensionality by summarizing signal across correlated markers, existing LD-based approaches are computationally demanding and rely on ad hoc threshold choices. Here, we introduce a novel LD-scaled association statistic, F&#x27;, which incorporates local LD directly into genotype-environment association tests using a fast permutation-based quantile transformation. Using forward-in-time simulations with known ground truth, we evaluate F&#x27; across two widely used methods-latent factor mixed models (LFMM) and EMMAX-and assess performance at the level of outlier regions rather than individual SNPs. We further integrate uncertainty in parameter choice and inference method using a consistency-based framework. Across simulations, LD-scaling and joint inference substantially increased detection power and robustness, yielding up to an order-of-magnitude improvement under strong genetic structuring and nearly doubling performance on average across scenarios. Applying this framework to three- and nine-spined stickleback datasets, we recover well-established genomic regions associated with parallel marine-freshwater adaptation with markedly reduced background noise compared to standard analyses. Together, our results demonstrate that explicitly leveraging LD structure and integrating over analytical uncertainty provides a powerful and computationally efficient extension to genome scans for selection, improving robustness and interpretability in both simulated and empirical settings.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Microbiomes typically vary between closely related host species, but how and why they diverge during host diversification remain poorly understood. Bees provide a well-established model for the role of sociality in microbiome evolution: solitary species have generalist gut bacterial symbionts, while eusocial honey bees and bumble bees have host-specific core gut bacterial symbionts. Curiously however, some species of stingless bees, the most diverse clade of eusocial bees, lack the core symbionts Snodgrassella and Gilliamella. Here, we tested whether group size, a fundamental trait of social organisms, explains symbiont gain and loss in stingless bees. Using specimens from a global collection, we performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR on 187 adult workers representing 29 species and 18 genera. Maximum reported colony sizes for these species range from 100 to over 100,000 individuals. Our phylogenetic models indicate positive feedbacks between group size and the symbionts Snodgrassella and Gilliamella. We suggest that challenges faced by large groups (e.g., disease risk) may select for symbionts that supply needed functionality (e.g., pathogen protection). Our findings highlight group size as a potentially widespread driver of microbiome evolution in social hosts.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study identifies an alternative endonuclease activity embedded in the LINE-1 ORF2 reverse transcriptase fold, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that could have enabled endonuclease-independent retrotransposition in primordial retroelements before dedicated endonuclease domains evolved.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Long INterspersed Element-1 (L1) retrotransposons use activities contained within the L1 open reading frame 2 encoded protein (ORF2p) to mobilize throughout the genome via target-site primed reverse transcription (TPRT). The ORF2p endonuclease domain (EN) cleaves genomic DNA to liberate a 3&#x27;-hydroxyl (3&#x27;-OH) group that is used by the ORF2p reverse transcriptase domain (RT) to synthesize a cDNA copy of its bound L1 RNA template. L1 also can move by EN-independent retrotransposition (ENi), where a 3&#x27;-OH group at genomic DNA lesions, dysfunctional telomeres, or stalled replication forks is proposed to prime L1 reverse transcription in the absence of L1 EN cleavage. We previously reported that ribonucleoprotein (RNP) preparations from cells transfected with a human wild-type (WT) L1 or L1 EN-mutant, but not an L1 RT-mutant, can initiate reverse transcription from a DNA oligonucleotide primer/L1 RNA template complex. The WT and EN-deficient L1 RNP preparations also are associated with a nuclease activity that can process a 3&#x27; end modification that precludes DNA synthesis from an oligonucleotide prior to priming the L1 RT reaction. Here, we purified recombinant full-length WT, L1 EN-, and L1 RT-mutant human L1 ORF2p from insect cells. We report that the WT and L1 EN-mutant, but not the L1 RT-mutant, contain an alternative endonuclease activity (alt-EN). Alt-EN activity also is detected in a bacterially expressed L1 ORF2p protein that lacks the L1 EN and ORF2p cysteine-rich domains and a thermostable group II intron-encoded protein. Processing of diverse modified primers demonstrates endonucleolytic cleavage that is eliminated by mutations in the RT active site. We propose that alt-EN is an evolutionarily conserved activity within the RT fold that promoted ENi retrotransposition of primordial retrotransposons prior to the acquisition of an EN domain.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Although secondary metabolites of medicinal plants can influence gut microbiota, their prebiotic and synbiotic potential remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to identify new medicinal plant-probiotic combinations that exhibit prebiotic and synbiotic effects through mutual synergism. Ten Himalayan medicinal plants were screened for selective prebiotic efficacy by assessing in vitro proliferation of three species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and the concurrent suppression of E. coli. The most effective plants were further evaluated for synergism with LAB via fermentation of pure extracts, followed by physicochemical, biological, and metabolomic profiling. Among these plants, Picrorhiza kurroa (PK) and Adhatoda vasica (AV) demonstrated promising prebiotic qualities with PAS scores of 0.50 and 0.44, respectively, while Lactobacillus fermentum (LF) proved to be the most compatible probiotic strain. Unlike AV, fermentation of PK with LF resulted in a significant increase in probiotic growth (2.2-fold), higher total flavonoids (21.6% increase), and enhanced antioxidant capacity (24.02% increase) compared to unfermented PK. Fermented PK notably improved cytoprotective effects and reduced oxidative damage (measured by ROS levels/lipid peroxidation) and inflammatory responses (NO/IL-6 levels) in macrophages and muscle cells subjected to separate exogenous stressors (LPS and H2O2). Elemental analysis (ICP-OES) and metabolomic profiling (LC-MS/UHPLC) revealed that LF metabolised major elements of PK (Ca/Fe/K/Na/Cu) and facilitated biotransformation of large secondary metabolites, including the characteristic iridoid glycosides of PK, into smaller, more abundant compounds. Consequently, the PK-LF combination is identified as a synbiotic, and its fermented product serves as a superior bioactive material suitable for development into innovative nutraceuticals or herbal formulations.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Physics-based modeling of post-division restoration of histone methylation (H3K9me3/H3K27me3) in multicellular eukaryotes, offering mechanistic insight into epigenetic information maintenance but only indirect relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In multi-cellular eukaryotic organisms, cell type and specific functional identity are defined by the epigenetic patterning of chemical modifications to DNA and chromatin that modulate the expression and silencing of specific genes. When a cell divides, histones containing important epigenetic marks are distributed between the two daughter strands leading to a temporary dilution of epigenetic information and cell identity. In this work we introduce a physics-based model of epigenetic memory that explains how cells restore and maintain H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 histone methylation patterning after cell division. We demonstrate that emergence and maintenance of the epigenetic program is driven by an evolved mechanism that makes use of the biophysics of polymers, phase condensates and enzymatic activity. We validate our model via genome-wide epigenetic time-course simulation and comparison to experimental epigenetic data from multiple donors, multiple cell types, and for multiple epigenetic marks. Finally, we use our model as a conceptual framework to understand cellular reprogramming by hypothesizing that these processes first contend with and later utilize somatic epigenetic maintenance programs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.14083v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We unveil a quantum Pontus-Mpemba effect enabled by the Liouvillian skin effect in a dissipative tight-binding chain with asymmetric incoherent hopping and coherent boundary coupling. The skin effect, induced by non-reciprocal dissipation, localizes relaxation modes near the system boundaries and gives rise to non-orthogonal spectral geometry. While such non-normality is often linked to slow relaxation, we show that it can instead accelerate relaxation through a two-step protocol - realizing a quantum Pontus-Mpemba effect. Specifically, we consider a one-dimensional open chain with coherent hopping $J$, asymmetric incoherent hoppings $J_{\rm R} \neq J_{\rm L}$, and a controllable end-to-end coupling $\epsilon$. For $\epsilon=0$, the system exhibits the Liouvillian skin effect, with left and right eigenmodes localized at opposite edges. We compare two relaxation protocols toward the same stationary state: (i) a direct relaxation with $\epsilon=0$, and (ii) a two-step (Pontus) protocol where a brief coherent evolution transfers the excitation across the lattice before relaxation. Although both share the same asymptotic decay rate, the two-step protocol relaxes significantly faster due to its reduced overlap with the slow boundary-localized Liouvillian mode. The effect disappears when $J_{\rm R}=J_{\rm L}$, i.e., when the skin effect vanishes. Our results reveal a clear connection between boundary-induced non-normality and protocol-dependent relaxation acceleration, suggesting new routes for controlling dissipation and transient dynamics in open quantum systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.12029v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation serves as a foundational model in nonlinear wave physics, describing the balance between dispersive spreading and nonlinear steepening that gives rise to solitons. This article introduces sangkuriang, an open-source Python library for solving this equation using Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization coupled with adaptive high-order time integration. The implementation leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation for computational efficiency while maintaining accessibility for instructional purposes. Validation encompasses progressively complex scenarios including isolated soliton propagation, symmetric two-wave configurations, overtaking collisions between waves of differing amplitudes, and three-body interactions. Conservation of the classical invariants is monitored throughout, with deviations remaining small across all test cases. Measured soliton velocities conform closely to theoretical predictions based on the amplitude-velocity relationship characteristic of integrable systems. Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics. The solver outputs data in standard scientific formats compatible with common analysis tools and generates visualizations of spatiotemporal wave evolution. By combining numerical accuracy with practical accessibility on modest computational resources, sangkuriang offers a platform suitable for both classroom demonstrations of nonlinear wave phenomena and exploratory research into soliton dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.13046v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Complex fluids such as water exhibits many anomalous phenomena, and research suggests these properties are closely tied to critical fluctuations near the liquid-liquid phase transition critical point (LLCP). However, whether a similar LLCP exists in metallic glass-forming liquids, which are notable for their high atomic coordination, remains an open question. Although dynamic anomalies such as the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein (SE) relation have often been attributed to dynamic heterogeneity or structural changes, relatively few studies have analyzed these anomalies from a thermodynamic-fluctuation perspective. This gap probably stems from the challenges in detecting density-driven phase transitions in such systems. Here, we use numerical simulations to explore the thermodynamic mechanisms behind dynamic anomalies in a prototypical metallic glass-forming melt. We observe substantial thermodynamic fluctuations near a particular region, which likely corresponds to a frustration state of liquid, vapor, and glass. These fluctuations may contribute to the violation of the SE relation. Our findings offer a fresh Griffiths-like perspective on the dynamic anomalies seen in supercooled metallic liquids, and shed new light on their underlying mechanisms.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2312.12254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: The process of aging following a hard quench into a glassy state is characterized universally, for a wide class of materials, by logarithmic evolution of state variables and a power-law decay of two-time correlation functions that collapse only for the ratio of those times. This stands in stark contrast with relaxation in equilibrium materials, where time-translational invariance holds. It is by now widely recognized that these aging processes, which ever so slowly relax a complex disordered material after a quench, are facilitated by activated events. Yet, theories often cited to describe such a non-equilibrium process can be shown to miss pertinent aspects that are inherent to many experiments. A case in point are recent experiments on crumpling sheets of mylar loaded by a weight whose acoustic emissions are measured while the material buckles. Using extensive simulations to generate long time-series of such buckling events, we show that crumpling is a log-Poisson process activated by increasingly rare record-sized fluctuations in a slowly stiffening material characterized by a logarithmically growing length-scale. Crumpling thus adds to a range of glassy materials exhibiting the log-Poisson property, which can be used to discriminate between theories.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This paper introduces an adaptive unitary state space model for improved formal-language expressivity and scalable training in machine learning, with no direct relevance to origins-of-life or astrobiology research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2507.05238v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Recent work has revealed that state space models (SSMs), while efficient for long-sequence processing, are fundamentally limited in their ability to represent formal languages-particularly due to time-invariant and real-valued recurrence structures. In this work, we draw inspiration from adaptive and structured dynamics observed in biological neural systems and introduce the Adaptive Unitary State Space Model (AUSSM): a novel class of SSMs that leverages skew-symmetric, input-dependent recurrence to achieve unitary evolution and high expressive power. Using algebraic automata theory, we prove that AUSSM can perform modulo counting and simulate solvable group automata at precision logarithmically bounded in the input length, enabling SSMs to model a broad class of regular languages out of reach for other SSM architectures. To overcome the practical inefficiencies of adaptive recurrence, we develop a separable convolution formulation and a CUDA implementation that enables scalable parallel training. Empirically, we show that AUSSM and its hybrid variant-interleaved with Mamba-outperform prior SSMs on formal algorithmic tasks such as parity and modular arithmetic, and achieve competent performance on real-world long time-series classification benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that adaptive unitary recurrence provides a powerful and efficient inductive bias for both symbolic and continuous sequence modeling.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.05837v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) serve as powerful black-box optimizers inspired by biological evolution. However, most existing EAs predominantly focus on heuristic operators such as crossover and mutation, while usually overlooking underlying physical interpretability such as statistical mechanics and thermosdynamics. This theoretical void limits the principled understanding of algorithmic dynamics, hindering the systematic design of evolutionary search beyond ad-hoc heuristics. To bridge this gap, we first point out that evolutionary optimization can be conceptually reframed as a physical phase transition process. Building on this perspective, we establish the theoretical grounds by modeling the optimization dynamics as a Wasserstein gradient flow of free energy. Consequently, a robust and interpretable solver named Wasserstein Evolution (WE) is proposed. WE mathematically frames the trade-off between exploration and exploitation as a competition between potential gradient forces and entropic forces. This formulation guarantees convergence to the Boltzmann distribution, thereby minimizing free energy and maximizing entropy, which promotes highly diverse solutions. Extensive experiments on complex multimodal and physical potential functions demonstrate that WE achieves superior diversity and stability compared to established baselines.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.12837v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Cognitive processes are realized across an extraordinary range of natural, artificial, and hybrid systems, yet there is no unified framework for comparing their forms, limits, and unrealized possibilities. Here, we propose a cognition space approach that replaces narrow, substrate-dependent definitions with a comparative representation based on organizational and informational dimensions. Within this framework, cognition is treated as a graded capacity to sense, process, and act upon information, allowing systems as diverse as cells, brains, artificial agents, and human-AI collectives to be analyzed within a common conceptual landscape. We introduce and examine three cognition spaces -- basal aneural, neural, and human-AI hybrid -- and show that their occupation is highly uneven, with clusters of realized systems separated by large unoccupied regions. We argue that these voids are not accidental but reflect evolutionary contingencies, physical constraints, and design limitations. By focusing on the structure of cognition spaces rather than on categorical definitions, this approach clarifies the diversity of existing cognitive systems and highlights hybrid cognition as a promising frontier for exploring novel forms of complexity beyond those produced by biological evolution.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.12723v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Optimization benchmarks play a fundamental role in assessing algorithm performance; however, existing artificial benchmarks often fail to capture the diversity and irregularity of real-world problem structures, while benchmarks derived from real-world problems are costly and difficult to construct. To address these challenges, we propose an evolutionary automatic benchmark generation framework that leverages a large language model (LLM) as a generative operator, termed the LLM-driven evolutionary benchmark generator (LLM-EBG). In this framework, the LLM serves as an evolutionary operator that generates and evolves benchmark problems within a flexible, expressive representation space. As a case study, we generate unconstrained single-objective continuous minimization problems represented as mathematical expressions designed to induce significant performance differences between a genetic algorithm (GA) and differential evolution (DE). Experimental results show that LLM-EBG successfully produces benchmark problems in which the designated target algorithm consistently outperforms the comparative algorithm in more than 80\% of trials. Furthermore, exploratory landscape analysis reveals that benchmarks favoring GA are highly sensitive to variable scaling, demonstrating that the proposed framework can generate problems with distinct geometric characteristics that reflect the intrinsic search behaviors of different optimization algorithms.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.13602v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: An elementary approach to characterizing the impact of noise scheduling and time discretization in generative diffusion models is developed. Considering a simplified model where the source distribution is multivariate Gaussian with a given covariance matrix, the explicit closed-form evolution trajectory of the distributions across reverse sampling steps is derived, and consequently, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the source distribution and the reverse sampling output is obtained. The effect of the number of time discretization steps on the convergence of this KL divergence is studied via the Euler-Maclaurin expansion. An optimization problem is formulated, and its solution noise schedule is obtained via calculus of variations, shown to follow a tangent law whose coefficient is determined by the eigenvalues of the source covariance matrix. For an alternative scenario, more realistic in practice, where pretrained models have been obtained for some given noise schedules, the KL divergence also provides a measure to compare different time discretization strategies in reverse sampling. Experiments across different datasets and pretrained models demonstrate that the time discretization strategy selected by our approach consistently outperforms baseline and search-based strategies, particularly when the budget on the number of function evaluations is very tight.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> A theoretical information-geometry study of entropy-constrained dynamics and a von Neumann-entropy “origin” state, with no direct connection to prebiotic chemistry, abiogenesis, or astrobiological contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.12576v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The inaccessible game is an information-geometric framework where dynamics of information loss emerge from maximum entropy production under marginal-entropy conservation. We study the game&#x27;s starting state, the origin. Classical Shannon entropy forbids a representation with zero joint entropy and positive marginal entropies: non-negativity of conditional entropy rules this out. Replacing Shannon with von Neumann entropy within the Baez Fritz Leinster Parzygnat categorical framework removes this obstruction and admits a well-defined origin: a globally pure state with maximally mixed marginals, selected up to local-unitary equivalence. At this LME origin, marginal-entropy conservation becomes a second-order geometric condition. Because the marginal-entropy sum is saturated termwise, the constraint gradient vanishes and first-order tangency is vacuous; admissible directions are selected by the kernel of the constraint Hessian, characterised by the marginal-preserving tangent space. We derive the constrained gradient flow in the matrix exponential family and show that, as the origin is approached, the affine time parameter degenerates. This motivates an axiomatically distinguished reparametrisation, entropy time $t$, defined by $dH/dt = c$ for fixed constant $c&gt;0$. In this parametrisation, the infinite affine-time approach to the boundary maps to a finite entropy-time interval. The constrained dynamics split into a symmetric dissipative component realising SEA and a reversible component represented as unitary evolution. As in the classical game, marginal-entropy conservation is equivalent to conservation of a sum of local modular Hamiltonian expectations, a state-dependent &quot;modular energy&quot;; in Gibbs regimes where local modular generators become approximately parameter-invariant, this reduces to familiar fixed-energy constraints from nonequilibrium thermodynamics.</p>

We employ a phase-plane analysis to elucidate the qualitative behaviour of streamlines for a range of different coupled-wave, and vorticity, regimes. Although the water waves considered are linear in the fluid dynamics sense, the dynamical systems which govern their motion are nonlinear.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Elucidating the mechanisms of aging is impeded by its stochastic, multi-scale nature and cellular heterogeneity, challenges that are compounded by the overwhelming volume of biomedical literature and the complexity of genome-wide datasets. To overcome these barriers, we present PersonaAI, an interactive agentic-AI framework that acts as a digital co-scientist. By integrating literature-based reasoning with autonomous in silico validation, PersonaAI synthesizes over 560,000 aging-related publications via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to propose mechanistic hypotheses. These hypotheses are subsequently validated by autonomous agents utilizing single-cell RNA-seq data. Using a temporal cutoff strategy restricted to pre-2020 literature, we demonstrate that PersonaAI can generate hypotheses effectively validated by post-2021 discoveries, proving its capacity for inference beyond simple information retrieval. In application, the system identified senescent Cirbp+ hepatocytes as a liver-intrinsic aging program and uncovered a middle-aged, male-specific decline in adipose stem and progenitor cells, driven by vascular niche deterioration and disrupted VEGF-VEGFR signaling. These results establish PersonaAI as a scalable platform that augments human intuition with autonomous data-driven validation, providing a generalizable platform for accelerating discovery in aging biology.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.12935v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Fluctuation-induced forces, such as the Critical Casimir Effect (CCE), are fundamental mechanisms driving organization and self-assembly near second-order phase transitions. The existence of a comparable, universal force for systems undergoing a first-order transition has remained an unresolved fundamental question. The proposed Orderphobic Effect is one such potential mechanism. It arises from minimisation of the interfacial free energy between solutes that locally nucleate a disordered phase. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration and quantitative measurement of the Orderphobic Effect. Using a driven, non-equilibrium quasi-2D granular fluid undergoing a first-order order-disorder transition, we show that specifically designed solutes in an ordered phase nucleate a coexisting ``bubble&#x27;&#x27; of the disordered phase. By analysing its capillary fluctuations, we confirm that this phenomenon occurs due to the proximity to phase-coexistence, and we directly quantify the attractive force by measuring the interaction free energy between solutes. The observation of this general fluctuation-mediated force in a non-equilibrium steady state strongly supports its claimed universality. Our work establishes the Orderphobic Effect as the first-order equivalent to the CCE, providing a new, general route for controlling self-assembly and aggregation in soft matter and non-equilibrium systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11947v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Biological matrices are rich in information related to life processes, serving as invaluable media for assessing an individual&#x27;s overall physiological status and its dynamic fluctuations, as well as crucial foundations for disease diagnosis. However, the inherent complexity of these matrices, coupled with our incomplete understanding of their full composition, presents significant challenges for comprehensive analysis and accurate diagnostic interpretation. The advent of single-molecule technologies has revolutionized biomedical research, enabling the direct observation of life processes at the molecular scale. We have proposed an Intelligent Nano-Fingerprinting strategy based on single-molecule nanopore technology, designed to capture the global molecular fingerprints of complex plasma matrices. Furthermore, we developed an intelligent algorithmic model capable of achieving precise classification of plasma samples. This approach is characterized by its simplicity, efficiency, and considerable potential for large-scale adoption and transferable applications.</p>

This paper develops existing computational models for locating Unstable Periodic Orbits (UPOs) in polynomial dynamical systems using Sum-of-Squares (SOS) optimization technique and proposes a numerical framework to converge UPOs for the Planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (PCR3BP) in astrodynamics. This is done by developing the polynomial SOS optimization technique with extension to systems with non-polynomial and Hamiltonian dynamics. First, we demonstrate and exploit the dependency of convergence of tight bounds on an observable of interest with varying scaling factors for large polynomial degrees. SOS optimization is then used to compute nonnegative polynomials, the minimization sublevel sets of which, approximately localise parts of the corresponding UPO. Improvements in current non-linear optimization techniques are suggested to compute a large number of points inside the relevant sublevel sets. Such points provide good initial conditions for UPO computations with existing algorithms. The distinguishing feature of such UPOs is that they optimize the long-time average of an input observable of interest which is a function of state variables. For the PCR3BP this means that such orbits in space can be traversed indefinitely in time without continuous fuel expenditure. As practical applications to space mission designs, we converge UPOs that minimise transmitted power required by satellites for the Earth-Moon system in a communication relay problem by minimizing the infinite-time average of sum of squares of distances of a satellite from Earth and the Moon.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study models humidity-driven twisting in spider dragline silk via nonlinear anisotropic elasticity (a dual Poynting effect), relevant to biomaterials mechanics but only marginally connected to origins-of-life beyond general water–biopolymer interactions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.13924v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Spider dragline silk supercontracts as humidity increases, displaying large axial shortening together with a reproducible macroscopic twist. The physical origin of this torsion remains debated and is often attributed to helically arranged load-bearing elements, despite the lack of direct evidence for helicity in the native fiber. Here we show that torsion can arise generically from nonlinear anisotropic elasticity: humidity-driven shortening of the amorphous matrix, mechanically constrained by stiff, axially aligned $\beta$-sheet--rich load-bearing segments and their experimentally induced prestretch, drives the system into a dual Poynting regime in which axial shortening couples to spontaneous twist. Coupling a diffusion-based water-uptake law to irreversible matrix remodeling and fiber plasticity, the model quantitatively reproduces monotonic and cyclic torsional measurements using parameter values consistent with available experimental material parameters. These results identify supercontraction-induced torsion in spider silk as a manifestation of a dual Poynting effect and provide a minimal, physically grounded framework for humidity-driven torsional actuation in matrix--fiber architectures.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Proposes a Noether-theorem-based conserved quantity for host immune capacity using a Lagrangian mechanics formalism, but it does not address origins-of-life, prebiotic chemistry, early evolution, or astrobiology-relevant habitability/biosignatures.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.02730v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The capacity to resist pathogens is recognized as a fundamental property of the immune system, yet the capacity itself remains a phenomenological concept and lacks a defined physical basis. Its fundamental entity, definition, and quantification are thus unresolved. Here, we address these questions by introducing a theoretical framework based on Lagrangian analytical mechanics, which recasts immune recognition as a dynamical system in an immunological state space. Generalized coordinates are used to describe the conformational states of immune receptors, and their evolution is governed by Euler-Lagrange equations constructed from the antigen-receptor interaction. Central to our theory is the identification of a continuous symmetry: the action remains invariant under specific translations within the antigenic structure space or time. From this symmetry, Noether&#x27;s theorem dictates a conserved quantity, $I$. We propose that $I$ is the physical embodiment of host immunity, a quantifiable measure that integrates the system&#x27;s protective sensitivity (with dimensions of action) and response intensity (with dimensions of energy). Furthermore, this framework unifies key immunological phenomena as dynamical consequences of the same underlying conservation law, including vaccination, immune memory, tolerance, original antigenic sin, and T cell exhaustion. The consistency of this model with established clinical observations (e.g., conserved symptom profiles across distinct influenza strains) and published experimental data provides its initial validation. By transforming immune capacity from a phenomenological concept into a quantifiable physical entity defined by a conservation law, this work establishes a foundational framework for a unified, predictive immunology.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11709v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Debris discs were long considered to be largely gas-free environments governed by collisional fragmentation, gravitational stirring, and radiative forces. Recent CO detections show that gas is present, but its abundance and origin remain uncertain. The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) revealed a narrow gas and dust ring in the disc HD 121617 with an asymmetric arc 40% brighter than the rest of the ring. We aim to constrain the total gas mass in HD 121617 assuming the dust arc is produced by hydrodynamical gas-dust interactions. We used the Dusty FARGO-ADSG code, modelling dust as Lagrangian particles, including radiation pressure and dust feedback, and varying the total gas mass. Simulations were compared to observations using radiative transfer. An unstable gas ring creates a size-dependent radial and azimuthal dust trap whose efficiency depends on gas mass. Two models, with 50 and 5 Earth masses of gas, reproduce both the ALMA band 7 arc and the outward offset of the VLT/SPHERE scattered-light ring via gas drag and radiation pressure. We infer a conservative gas-mass range of 2.5 to 250 Earth masses. If the ALMA asymmetry is caused by gas drag, the required gas mass compared with the observed CO implies substantial H2, consistent with primordial gas. HD 121617 would then be a hybrid disc between protoplanetary and debris stages. Since a planet could also create an arc, future observations are needed to distinguish these scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11712v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: CO gas is detected in a significant number of debris discs, but its origin and evolution remains unclear. Key constraints are its mass and spectro-spatial distribution, which are coupled through optical depth and have only been analysed at low to moderate resolution so far. The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) is the first ALMA large program to target debris discs at high spectro-spatial resolution. We used $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO J=3-2 line data of 18 ARKS debris belts, 5 of which were already known to host gas, to analyse the spectro-spatial distribution of CO, constrain the gas masses, and to search for gas in the remaining systems. We developed a line-imaging pipeline and produced line cubes for each disc, with a spatial resolution down to $\sim$70 mas and spectral resolution of 26 m s$^{-1}$. Using spectro-spatial shifting and stacking, we produced high signal-to-noise maps, and radial and spectral profiles that reveal the distribution and kinematics of gas in 5 gas-bearing discs. For these discs, we constrained the inner radius of the $^{12}$CO, and found the radial brightness profile of CO peaked interior to the dust ring, but that CO was more radially extended than the dust. We present the first radially resolved $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO isotopologue flux ratios in gas-bearing debris discs, which are constant with radius for the majority of systems, indicating $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO are both optically thick or thin throughout the discs. We report CO line fluxes/upper limits for all systems and optical depth dependant masses for the 5 gas-bearing systems. Finally, we analysed the $^{12}$CO J=3-2 line luminosities for the ARKS debris discs and discs from the literature. We confirm that gas is mostly detected in young systems. However, the high scatter seen in young/high fractional luminosity systems indicates no trend within the systems with detected gas.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11692v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We investigate the orbital dynamics of four-planet systems consisting of Earth-mass planets on initially-circular, coplanar orbits around a star of one solar mass. In our simulations, the innermost planet&#x27;s semimajor axis is set at 1 AU, with subsequent semimajor axes spaced equally in terms of planets&#x27; mutual Hill radii. Several sets of initial planetary longitudes are investigated, with integrations continuing for up to $10^{10}$ orbits of the innermost planet, stopping if a pair of planets pass within 0.01 AU of each other or if a planet is ejected from the system. We find that the simulated lifetimes of four-planet systems follow the general trend of increasing exponentially with planetary spacing, as seen by previous studies of closely-spaced planets. Four-planet system lifetimes are intermediate between those of three- and five-planet systems and more similar to the latter. Moreover, as with five-planet systems, but in marked contrast to the three-planet case, no initial semimajor axes spacings are found to yield systems that survive several orders of magnitude longer than other similar spacings. First- and second-order mean-motion resonances (MMRs) between planets correlate with reductions in system lifetimes. Additionally, we find that third-order MMRs between planets on neighboring orbits also have a substantial, though smaller, destabilizing effect on systems very near resonance that otherwise would be very long-lived. Local extrema of system lifetimes as a function of planetary spacing occur at slightly smaller initial orbital separation for systems with planets initially at conjunction relative to those in which the planets begin on widely-separated longitudes. This shift is produced by the asymmetric mutual planetary perturbations as the planets separate in longitude from the initial aligned configuration that cause orbits to spread out in semimajor axis.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11708v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The outer regions of planetary systems host dusty debris discs analogous to the Kuiper belt (exoKuiper belts), which provide crucial constraints on planet formation and evolution processes. ALMA dust observations have revealed a great diversity, and that some belts contain CO gas, whose origin and implications are uncertain. Most of this progress, however, has been limited by low-resolution observations. We conducted the first ALMA large programme dedicated to debris discs: the ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS). We selected the 24 most promising belts to constrain their detailed radial and vertical structure, and to characterise the gas content. We constrained the radial and vertical distribution of dust, as well as the presence of asymmetries. For a subset of six belts with CO gas, we constrained the gas distribution and kinematics. To interpret these observations, we used a wide range of dynamical models. The first ARKS results are presented as a series of ten papers. We discovered that up to 33% of our sample exhibits multiple dusty rings. For highly inclined belts, we found that non-Gaussian vertical distributions are common and are indicative of multiple dynamical populations. We also found that 10 of the 24 belts present asymmetries. We find that the CO gas is radially broader than the dust, but this could be an effect of optical depth. At least one system shows non-Keplerian kinematics due to strong pressure gradients, which may have triggered a vortex that trapped dust in an arc. Finally, we find evidence that the micron-sized grains may be affected by gas drag in gas rich systems. ARKS has revealed a great diversity of structures in exoKuiper belts that may arise when they are formed in protoplanetary discs or subsequently via interactions with planets and/or gas. We encourage the community to explore the reduced data and data products.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11881v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Escape trajectories from the Earth-Moon system play an important role in interplanetary transfer. This paper focuses on the escape trajectories from a 167 km circular Earth orbit in the Earth-Moon planar circular three-body problem and the Sun-Earth/Moon planar bicircular four-body problem and is denoted to providing a comprehensive analysis on these escape trajectories. To achieve these purposes, the global maps of escape trajectories are constructed, and escape trajectories with one lunar gravity assist are pre-filtered. Then, an effective method to identification escape families is proposed based on dynamical analysis and data mining techniques. Once the escape families are identified, the corresponding characteristics are analyzed to provide insights into the construction of escape trajectories. Based on these escape families, the effects of the solar gravity perturbation on the number of escape trajectories, the emergence and disappearance of escape families, variation in generalized energy, and transfer characteristics are further summarized, providing insights into the model selection in the escape trajectory construction. This paper establishes an analysis methodology of escape trajectories from a perspective of escape families, deepening the understanding of escape dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11767v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Long-period comets, which are often considered to be representative of material in the protoplanetary disk that formed the Solar System, are ideal to investigate the question of chemical inheritance in astronomy. Determining the chemistry of comets, both individually and as a population, has become of great importance in comparative studies against sources representative of evolutionary precursors to planetary systems. Contemporaneous observations of long-period comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) were obtained with the JWST and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in early 2023 March. This work focuses on \ce{CH3OH} measurements from both ALMA and JWST as well as \ce{H2O} measurements from JWST. Radiative transfer modeling of \ce{CH3OH} and \ce{H2O} was performed to investigate spatial variations in rotational temperature, column density, and production rates, as well as a comparison of derived values between the two telescopes. Most of the spatial distributions of the modeled values are centrally peaked, and the modeled values from JWST are all within the error bars of the average values from ALMA. C/2022 E3 (ZTF) also displays an enhancement in modeled rotational temperature in the anti-Sunward direction that is shown to be statistically significant. Based on non-LTE radiative transfer modeling, the declining \ce{H2O} rotational temperatures as a function of nucleocentric distance observed by JWST can be explained primarily as a result of rotational line cooling. The values derived in this work are in general agreement with single-dish millimeter-wave observations.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11732v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Dusty discs detected around main-sequence stars are thought to be signs of planetesimal belts in which the dust distribution is shaped by collisional and dynamical processes, including interactions with gas if present. The debris disc around the young A-type star HD 131835 is composed of two dust rings at ~65 au and ~100 au, a third unconstrained innermost component, and a gaseous component centred at ~65 au. New ALMA observations show that the inner of the two dust rings is brighter than the outer one, in contrast with previous observations in scattered light. We explore two scenarios that could explain these observations: the two dust rings might represent distinct planetesimal belts with different collisional properties, or only the inner ring might contain planetesimals while the outer ring consists entirely of dust that has migrated outwards due to gas drag. To explore the first scenario, we employed a state-of-the-art collisional evolution code. To test the second scenario, we used a simple dynamical model of dust grain evolution in an optically thin gaseous disc. Collisional models of two planetesimal belts cannot fully reproduce the observations by only varying their dynamical excitation, and matching the data through a different material strength requires an extreme difference in dust composition. The gas-driven scenario can reproduce the location of the outer ring and the brightness ratio of the two rings from scattered light observations, but the resulting outer ring is too faint overall in both scattered light and sub-millimetre emission. The dust rings in HD 131835 could be produced from two planetesimal belts, although how these belts would attain the required extremely different properties needs to be explained. The dust-gas interaction is a plausible alternative explanation and deserves further study using a more comprehensive model.</p>

Our aims are to identify asymmetries in debris disc dust distributions, quantify debris disc asymmetry properties, and discuss the potential origins of debris disc asymmetries.** We utilised empirical methods to identify emission asymmetries** and the presence of offset emission between disc centres and the locations of the host stars, via an analysis of their calibration procedures and disc properties. We associated observational asymmetry types** and plausible physical classes** associated with each source. We show that there are ten systems, almost half of the ARKS sample, that host either a continuum emission asymmetry or offset emission. Three systems host offsets (HD15115, HD32297, and HD109573 (HR4796)), four host azimuthal asymmetries (HD9672 (49Ceti), HD92945, HD107146, and HD121617), two host an asymmetry in their major axis (HD10647 (q$^1$ Eri), and HD39060 ($\beta$ Pic)), and one hosts an asymmetry in their minor axis (HD61005). We attribute the offset asymmetries to non-zero eccentricities, and three of the azimuthal asymmetries to arcs. The presence of an asymmetry or offset in the ARKS sample appears to be correlated with the fractional luminosity of cold dust.** Conclusions: This study demonstrates that debris disc asymmetries in the ARKS sample are common, and plausibly so in the wider population of debris discs at (sub)-millimetre wavelengths.** ** = ABRIDGED FOR ARXIV: FULL ABSTRACT IN PAPER</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11785v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent research raises the possibility that 3 and 7 million years ago, the Sun encountered massive clouds that shrank the heliosphere--the solar cocoon protecting our solar system--exposing Earth to its interstellar environment, in agreement with geological evidence from 60Fe and 244Pu isotopes. Here we show that during such encounters Earth was exposed to increased radiation in the form of high-energy particles. During periods of Earth&#x27;s immersion in the heliosphere, it received particle radiation that we name Heliospheric Energetic Particles (HEPs). The intensity of &lt; 10 MeV protons was at least an order of magnitude more intense than today&#x27;s most extreme solar energetic particle (SEP) events. SEPs today last minutes to hours, but HEP exposure then lasted for extensive periods of several months, making it a prolonged external driver. During Earth&#x27;s excursion outside the heliosphere, it was exposed to a galactic cosmic ray radiation with the intensity of &lt; 1 GeV protons at least an order of magnitude more intense than today. Therefore, the space surrounding Earth was permeated by a variable high-energy radiation. We discuss the implications for Earth&#x27;s climate and biodiversity.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.12501v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The tidal disruption of planets by their host stars represents a growing area of interest in transient astronomy, offering insights into the final stages of planetary system evolution. We model the hydrodynamic evolution and predict the multi-wavelength observational signatures of planetary TDEs around a solar-mass host, focusing on Jupiter-like and Neptune-like progenitors and examining how different eccentricities of the planet&#x27;s pre-disruption orbit shape the morphology and emission of the tidal debris.We perform 2D hydrodynamic simulations using the FARGO3D code to model the formation and viscous evolution of the resulting debris disk. We employ a viscous alpha-disk prescription and include a time-dependent energy equation to compute the disk&#x27;s effective temperature and subsequently derive the bolometric and multi-band photometric light curves.Our simulations show that planetary TDEs produce a diverse range of luminous transients. A Jupiter-like planet disrupted from a circular orbit at the Roche limit generates a transient peaking at $L_{bol} \approx 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ after a 12-day rise. In contrast, the same planet on an eccentric orbit (e=0.5) produces a transient of comparable peak luminosity but on a much shorter timescale, peaking in only 1 day and followed by a highly volatile light curve. We find that the effect of eccentricity is not universal, as it accelerates the event for Jupiter but delays it for Neptune. A robust &quot;bluer-when-brighter&quot; colour evolution is a common feature as the disk cools over its multi-year lifetime. The strong dependence of light curve morphology on the initial orbit and progenitor mass makes these events powerful diagnostics. This framework is crucial for identifying planetary TDEs in time-domain surveys.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.12396v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The radius valley,a deficit of planets near 2 $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$, was observed among exoplanets of radius $\lesssim$ 5 $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$ with periods $&lt;$ 100 days by NASA&#x27;s $Kepler$ mission. It separates super-Earths (rocky, $\lesssim 1.9$ $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$) from sub-Neptunes (volatile-rich, $\gtrsim 2$ $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$) and may arise from formation conditions or atmospheric loss. Disentangling these mechanisms has led to numerous studies of population-level trends, although the resulting interpretations remain sensitive to sample selection and the robustness of host-star parameters. We re-examine its existence, depth, and dependence on period, flux, stellar mass, and age. Using SWEET-Cat and MAISTEP tool, we derived stellar parameters for 1,221 main-sequence stars (1,405 planets), with effective temperatures 4400--7500 K and radii 0.62--2.75 $\mathrm{R_{\odot}}$, achieving 2\% precision in radius and mass. Planetary radii were recomputed from radius ratios, yielding 5\% median uncertainty. The valley is partially filled near 2 $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$ and depends on period, flux, and stellar mass, with slopes $-0.12^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$, $0.10^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$, and $0.19^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$. Sub-Neptunes show a stronger stellar mass-dependent trend than super-Earths ($0.17^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ vs $0.11^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$). With stellar age, the super-Earth/sub-Neptune ratio rises from $0.51^{+0.11}_{-0.08}$ ($&lt;3$ Gyr) to $0.64^{+0.11}_{-0.11}$ ($\gtrsim3$ Gyr), and the valley becomes shallower and shifts to larger radii. A 4D fit shows consistent slopes with 2D analyses and a weaker age trend ($0.07^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$). These results suggest prolonged atmospheric loss, which is consistent with a core-powered mass loss scenario and emphasize the need for improved determinations, a goal expected to be achieved by future missions like PLATO.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.13104v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We present the JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum of the misaligned hot Jupiter HAT-P-30b from 2.8--5.2 $\mu$m as part of the BOWIE-ALIGN survey, a comparative survey designed to probe the link between planet formation and atmospheric composition in samples of misaligned and aligned hot Jupiters orbiting F-type stars. Through independent data reductions and retrieval analyses, we find evidence for absorption features of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ in the atmosphere of HAT-P-30b. Our retrieved abundances are consistent with equilibrium chemistry, from which we infer a sub-solar C/O ratio (0.16--0.45), and sub-solar and sub-stellar metallicity (0.2--0.8$\times$solar, compared to a stellar metallicity of 1.1--1.6$\times$solar), with muted spectral features. This composition challenges formation models of continuous migration and accretion within a steady disc of stellar metallicity, and could be the result of low C/O ratio gas accretion within the water ice line, low metallicity accretion due to the trapping of volatiles further out in the disc, or the combined accretion of low metallicity gas and carbon-poor solids.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.12972v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The long-term dynamical evolution of asteroid families is governed by the interplay between orbital and rotational evolution driven by thermal forces and collision. We aim to observationally trace the rotational evolution of main-belt asteroid families over Gyr timescales. We analyzed rotational properties of 8739 asteroids with spin period measurements and 3794 asteroids with obliquity determinations across 28 asteroid families spanning ages from 14~Myrs to 3~Gyrs. We introduced a dimensionless timescale that normalizes each asteroid&#x27;s family age by its classical YORP timescale, enabling direct comparison of rotational states across different evolutionary stages. We examined two key observables: the fraction of slow rotators (periods greater than or equal to 30 hours) and the polarization fraction (the degree to which asteroid spin poles align correctly with their position in the family&#x27;s V-shape distribution according to the Yarkovsky theory). Evolution of both quantities were fitted to identify characteristic transition timescales. We discovered that the slow-rotator fraction increases steeply with $t$ and saturates at $f_{\rm slow} \simeq 0.25$ around a breakpoint $t_{\rm bp} \simeq 20$. This implies a stochastic YORP timescale $\tau_{\rm YORP,stoc} \simeq 10\,\tau_{\rm YORP}$ by comparison with rotational evolution models that include tumbling and weakened YORP torques. The polarization fraction reaches a maximum of $\simeq 0.8$ at $t \simeq 16$ and then decays toward the random limit $f_{\rm pol} \rightarrow 0.5$ for $t \gtrsim 20$, indicating an increasing dominance of collisional spin reorientation over time. The rotation properties within different asteroid families offer crucial clues to rotation evolution and can serve as a new dimension for age estimation of asteroid families with more data in the LSST era.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.12586v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Debris discs are analogues to our own Kuiper belt around main-sequence stars and are therefore referred to as exoKuiper belts. They have been resolved at high angular resolution at wavelengths spanning the optical to the submillimetre-millimetre regime. Short wavelengths probe the light scattered by such discs, which is dominated by micron-sized dust particles, while millimetre wavelengths probe the thermal emission of millimetre-sized particles. Determining differences in the dust distribution between millimetre- and micron-sized dust is fundamental to revealing the dynamical processes affecting the dust in debris discs. We aim to compare the scattered light from the discs of the ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) with the thermal emission probed by ALMA. We focus on the radial distribution of the dust. We used high-contrast scattered light observations obtained with VLT/SPHERE, GPI, and the HST to uniformly study the dust distribution in those systems and compare it to the dust distribution extracted from the ALMA observations carried out in the course of the ARKS project. We also set constraints on the presence of planets by using these high-contrast images combined with exoplanet evolutionary models. 15 of the 24 discs comprising the ARKS sample are detected in scattered light, with TYC9340-437-1 being imaged for the first time at near-infrared wavelengths. For 6 of those 15 discs, the dust surface density seen in scattered light peaks farther out compared to that observed with ALMA. These 6 discs except one are known to also host cold CO gas. Conversely, the systems without significant offsets are not known to host gas, except one. This observational study suggests that the presence of gas in debris discs may affect the small and large grains differently, pushing the small dust to greater distances where the gas is less abundant.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Develops low-energy mission design methods using multiple Venus gravity assists to enable flybys of potentially hazardous asteroids (with possible Earth return) across 2029–2050 launch windows.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.12759v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This work develops low-energy spacecraft (SC) trajectories using Venus gravity assists to study asteroids during heliocentric transfer segments between planetary encounters. The study focuses on potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) as primary exploration targets. This paper proposes a method for calculating SC trajectories that enable asteroid flybys after a Venus gravity assist. The method involves formulating and solving an optimization problem to design trajectories incorporating flybys of selected asteroids and Venus. Trajectories are calculated using two-body dynamics by solving the Lambert problem. A preliminary search for candidate asteroids uses an algorithm to narrow the search space of the optimization problem. This algorithm uses the V-infinity globe technique to connect planetary gravity assists with resonant orbits. The resonant orbit in this case serves as an initial approximation for the SC&#x27;s trajectory between two successive planetary flybys. Four flight schemes were analyzed, including multiple flybys of Venus and asteroids, with the possibility of an SC returning to Earth. The proposed solutions reduce flight time between asteroid approaches, increase gravity assist frequency, and enhance mission design flexibility. The use of Venus gravity assists and resonant orbits ensures a close encounter with at least one asteroid during the SC&#x27;s trajectory between two consecutive flybys of Venus, and demonstrates the feasibility of periodic Venus gravity assists and encounters with PHAs. The developed method was applied to construct trajectories that allow an SC to approach both Venus-resonant asteroids and PHAs via multiple Venus gravity assists. An additional study was carried out to identify asteroids accessible during the Earth-Venus segment in launch windows between 2029 and 2050.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.12578v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Knowing the masses and sizes of protoplanetary disks is of fundamental importance for the contemporary theories of planet formation. However, their measurements are associated with large uncertainties. In this proof of concept study, we focus on the very early stages of disk evolution, concurrent with the formation of the protostellar seed, because it is then that the initial conditions for subsequent planet formation are likely established. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a protoplanetary disk followed by radiation transfer postprocessing, we constructed synthetic disk images at millimeter wavelengths. We then calculated the synthetic disk radii and masses using an algorithm that is often applied to observations of protoplanetary disks with ALMA, and compared the resulting values with the actual disk mass and size derived directly from hydrodynamic modeling. We paid specific attention to the effects of dust growth on the discrepancy between synthetic and intrinsic disk masses and radii. We find that the dust mass is likely underestimated in Band 6 by factors of 1.4-4.2 when Ossenkopf &amp; Henning opacities and typical dust temperatures are used, but the discrepancy reduces in Band~3, where the dust mass can be even overestimated. Dust growth affects both disk mass and size estimates via the dust-size-dependent opacity, and extremely low values of dust temperature (~ several Kelvin) are required to recover the intrinsic dust mass when dust has grown to mm-sized grains and its opacity has increased. Dust mass estimates are weakly sensitive to the distance to the source, while disk radii may be seriously affected. We conclude that the accuracy of measuring the dust mass and disk radius during the formation of a protoplanetary disk also depends on the progress in dust growth. (Abridged)</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> 1D simulations show how viscous vs MHD-wind angular momentum transport and external FUV photoevaporation jointly control protoplanetary disc spreading, gas/dust loss, and the survival time of solids needed for planet formation in irradiated environments.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.13200v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The evolution of protoplanetary discs is a function of their internal processes and of their environment. It is unclear if angular momentum is mainly removed viscously or by magnetic winds, or by a combination of the two. While external photoevaporation is expected to influence disc evolution and dispersal, there are observational limitations towards highly irradiated discs. The interplay between these ingredients and their effect on the gas and dust distributions are poorly understood. We investigate the evolution of both the gaseous and solid components of viscous, MHD-wind or hybrid discs, in combination with external FUV-driven mass loss. We test which combinations of parameters protect discs from external irradiation, allowing the solid component to live long enough to allow planet formation to succeed. We run a suite of 1D simulations of smooth discs with varying initial sizes, levels of viscous and MHD-wind stresses modeled via an $\alpha$ parametrisation, and strengths of the external FUV environment. We track disc radii, various lifetime diagnostics, and the amount of dust removed by the photoevaporative wind, as a function of the underlying parameters. The biggest role in determining the fate of discs is played by a combination of its ability to spread radially outwards and the strength of FUV-driven erosion. While MHD wind-driven discs experience less FUV erosion due to the lack of spread, they do not live for longer compared to viscously evolving discs, especially at low-to-moderate FUV fluxes, while higher fluxes yield disc lifetimes that are insensitive to the disc&#x27;s angular momentum transport mechanism. For the solid component, the biggest role is played by a combination of inward drift and removal by FUV winds. This points to the importance of other physical ingredients, such as disc substructures, even in highly-irradiated disc regions, in order to retain solids.</p>

There are a variety of such models in the literature, each adopting different equations of state (EOS) to describe the materials&#x27; properties at depth and varying assumptions about the minerals present within the planets. These EOS+mineral suites provide the foundations for compositional inferences, but they have not yet been systematically compared. In this work, we review several suites, with a detailed description of the basic structure, mineral physics, and materials within standard small planet models. We show that EOS+mineral suites predict planet densities whose differences are comparable to current observational uncertainties, which present a challenge for robustly interpreting and classifying small planets. We apply a powerful small-planet characterization framework, which illustrates that variations among EOS+mineral suites lead to inconsistent conclusions for both individual planets and sample-level demographics. Our results demonstrate the need for more careful considerations of the materials and EOS used in mass-radius-composition models, especially given the current focus on finding and characterizing potentially habitable rocky planets. We conclude with recommendations for best practices so that future interpretations of small planets and their formation are accurate and consistent.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Describes ESA’s Meerkat Asteroid Guard service for rapid orbit determination and impact-probability alerts from short-arc NEO observations, relevant mainly as planetary-defense context rather than origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.13323v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We present the Meerkat Asteroid Guard, an imminent impactor warning service developed and maintained by the European Space Agency&#x27;s Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre (NEOCC). The software uses the method of systematic ranging to perform orbit determination on tracklets in the Near-Earth Object Confirmation Page (NEOCP), which typically have short observational arcs. Fitted orbits are propagated to determine the likelihood of an impact with Earth. In addition, magnitude fitting and Monte Carlo sampling are performed to estimate the object&#x27;s size, possible impact locations and times, and suggest a best telescope pointing for object follow-up. A set of object scores are produced from computed posterior probabilities across the grid, giving a statistical description of the object&#x27;s orbital and physical characteristics. The scores are packaged with several informative plots in an email alert, which is sent to Meerkat subscribers in the event of a significant impact probability, close approach, or other scientifically interesting event. The highlights of the five years of Meerkat&#x27;s operational service are presented, including the successful warnings for all of the past six imminent impactors discovered before impact and several interesting close approaches.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.13670v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) was recently completed to cover the lack of high-resolution observations of debris discs and to investigate the prevalence of substructures such as radial gaps and rings in a sample of 24 discs. This study characterises the radial structure of debris discs in the ARKS programme. To identify and quantify the disc substructures, we modelled all discs with a range of non-parametric and parametric approaches. We find that of the 24 discs in the sample, 5 host multiple rings, 7 are single rings that display halos or additional low-amplitude rings, and 12 are single rings with at most tentative evidence of additional substructures. The fractional ring widths that we measured are significantly narrower than previously derived values, and they follow a distribution similar to the fractional widths of individual rings resolved in protoplanetary discs. However, there exists a population of rings in debris discs that are significantly wider than those in protoplanetary discs. We also find that discs with steep inner edges consistent with planet sculpting tend to be found at smaller (&lt;100 au) radii, while more radially extended discs tend to have shallower edges more consistent with collisional evolution. An overwhelming majority of discs have radial profiles well-described by either a double power law or double-Gaussian parametrisation. While our findings suggest that it may be possible for some debris discs to inherit their structures directly from protoplanetary discs, there exists a sizeable population of broad debris discs that cannot be explained in this way. Assuming that the distribution of millimetre dust reflects the distribution of planetesimals, mechanisms that cause rings in protoplanetary discs to migrate or debris discs to broaden soon after formation may be at play, possibly mediated by planetary migration or scattering.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.13480v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The Kepler-observed distribution of planet sizes have revealed two distinct patterns: (1) a radius valley separating super-Earths and sub-Neptunes and (2) a preference for intra-system size similarity. We present a new model for the exoplanet population observed by Kepler, which is a &quot;hybrid&quot; of a clustered multi-planet model in which the orbital architectures are set by the angular momentum deficit (AMD) stability (He et al. 2020; arXiv:2007.14473) and a joint mass-radius-period model involving envelope mass-loss driven by photoevaporation (Neil &amp; Rogers 2020; arXiv:1911.03582). We find that the models that produce the deepest radius valleys have a primordial population of planets with initial radii peaking at $\sim 2.1 R_\oplus$, which is subsequently sculpted by photoevaporation into a bimodal distribution of final planet radii. The hybrid model requires strongly clustered initial planet masses in order to match the distributions of the size similarity metrics. Thus, the preference for intra-system radius similarity is well explained by a clustering in the primordial mass distribution. The hybrid model also naturally reproduces the observed radius cliff (steep drop-off beyond $\sim 2.5 R_\oplus$). Our hybrid model is the latest installment of the SysSim forward models, and is the first multi-planet model capable of simultaneously reproducing the observed radius valley and the intra-system size similarity patterns. We compute occurrence rates and fractions of stars with planets for a variety of planet types, and find that the occurrence of Venus and Earth-like planets drops by a factor of $\sim 2$-4 for the hybrid models compared to previous clustered models in which there is no envelope mass-loss.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.13585v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: China&#x27;s Tianwen-2 mission, launched on 29 May 2025, targets the near-Earth object (469219) Kamo`oalewa, an Earth quasi-satellite trapped in a 1:1 mean-motion resonance with our planet. Determining the origin of Kamo`oalewa is central to understanding the formation pathways and dynamical evolution of Earth&#x27;s quasi-satellite population. Here we show a strong possibility of main-belt origin for Kamo`oalewa using long-term dynamical simulations. We examine three candidate source regions: the $\nu_6$ secular resonance ($\nu_6$), the 3:1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter (3:1J MMR), and the Flora family. A total of 42,825 test particles were integrated over 100 Myr. We find that asteroids from all three regions can be transported onto Kamo`oalewa-like orbits, albeit with markedly different efficiencies. Particles originating near the $\nu_6$ show the highest transfer probability (3.31%), followed by the Flora family (2.54%) and the 3:1J MMR (0.39%). We further identify representative dynamical pathways linking these source regions to Earth quasi-satellite orbits. The Tianwen-2 spacecraft is expected to rendezvous with Kamo`oalewa in 2026, performing close-proximity operations and returning samples. The mission will provide decisive observational constraints on the asteroid&#x27;s composition and physical properties, offering a critical test of its proposed origin.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.14076v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Detecting small planets via the radial velocity method remains challenged by signals induced by stellar variability, versus the effects of the planet(s). Here, we explore using Gaussian Process (GP) regression with Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry in modeling radial velocities (RVs) to help to mitigate stellar jitter from oscillations and granulation for exoplanet detection. We applied GP regression to simultaneous TESS photometric and RV data of HD 5562, a G-type subgiant ($M_\star=1.09M_{\odot}$, $R_\star=1.88R_{\odot}$) with a V magnitude of 7.17, using photometry to inform the priors for RV fitting. The RV data is obtained by the Magellan Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS). The photometry-informed GP regression reduced the RV scatter of HD~5562 from 2.03 to 0.51 m/s. We performed injection and recovery tests to evaluate the potential of GPs for discovering small exoplanets around evolved stars, which demonstrate that the GP provides comparable noise reduction to the binning method. We also found that the necessity of photometric data depends on the quality of the RV dataset. For long baseline and high-cadence RV observations, GP regression can effectively mitigate stellar jitter without photometric data. However, for intermittent RV observations, incorporating photometric data improves GP fitting and enhances detection capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.14177v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The unprecedented wavelength coverage and sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) permits to measure the absorption features of a wide range of condensate species from Silicates to Titan tholins. Atmospheric retrievals are uniquely suited to analyse these datasets and characterize the aerosols present in exoplanet atmospheres. However, including the optical properties of condensed particles within retrieval frameworks remains computationally expensive, limiting our ability to fully exploit JWST observations. In this work, we improve the computational efficiency and scaling behavior of aerosol models in atmospheric retrievals, enabling in-depth studies including multiple condensate species within practical time scales. Rather than computing the aerosol Mie coefficients for each sampled model, we pre-compute extinction efficiency (Qext), scattering efficiency (Qscat) and asymmetry parameter (g) grids for seven condensate species relevant in exoplanet atmospheres (Mg2SiO4 amorph sol - gel, MgSiO3 amorph glass, MgSiO3 amorph sol - gel, SiO2 alpha, SiO2 amorph, SiO and Titan tholins). The pre-computed Qext grids significantly reduce computation time between 1.4 and 17 times with negligible differences on the retrieved parameters. They also scale effortlessly with the number of aerosol species while maintaining the accuracy of cloud models. Thereby enabling more complex retrievals as well as broader population studies without increasing the overall error budget. The Qext, Qscat and g grids are freely available on Zenodo as well as a public TauREx plugin -TauREx-PCQ- that utilize them.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.14045v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We present the discovery and characterisation of two transiting exoplanets orbiting the metal-poor, solar-type star TOI-5788. From our analysis of six \textit{TESS} sectors and a dedicated \textit{CHEOPS} programme, we identify an inner planet (TOI-5788~b; $P = 6.340758\pm0.000030\,\si{\day}$) with radius $1.528\pm0.075\,\mathrm{R_\oplus}$ and an outer planet (TOI-5788~c; $P = 16.213362\pm0.000026\,\si{\day}$) with radius $2.272\pm0.039\,\mathrm{R_\oplus}$. We obtained 125 radial-velocity spectra from HARPS-N and constrain the masses of TOI-5788~b and~c as $3.72\pm0.94\,\mathrm{M_\oplus}$ and $6.4\pm1.2\,\mathrm{M_\oplus}$, respectively. Although dynamical analyses indicate that a third planet could exist in a stable orbit between 8 and 14 days, we find no evidence of additional planets. Since the TOI-5788 system is one of the few systems with planets straddling the radius gap, and noting that there are even fewer such systems around metal poor stars, it is a promising system to constrain planet formation theories. We therefore model the interior structures of both planets. We find that TOI-5788~b is consistent with being a rocky planet with almost no envelope, or having an atmosphere of a high mean molecular weight. We find that TOI-5788~c is consistent with both gas-dwarf and water-world hypotheses of mini-Neptune formation. We model the atmospheric evolution history of both planets. Whilst both scenarios are consistent with the atmospheric evolution of TOI-5788~c, the gas-dwarf model is marginally preferred. The results of the atmospheric evolution analysis are not strongly dependent on stellar evolution. This makes the system a promising target to test internal structure and atmospheric evolution models.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2406.15021v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The irradiance received by a spherical body or a planet close to a spherically symmetric source does not follow the point-sized source approximation and the inverse-square variation of irradiation if spherical symmetry is broken. In the penumbral zones of the planet, spherical symmetry of the star reduces to an axial symmetry. Our work aims to put forward a fundamental explanation, using energy conservation, to determine the variation of irradiance in the penumbral zone on a close-in planet where the point-sized source approximation fails. Consequently, we propose a numerical model that accurately predicts the irradiance within the boundaries of the penumbral zone and the fully-illuminated zone. Our analysis also corrects a previous study on exoplanet irradiation that violates energy conservation. We find that night-side illumination partially explains the observed night-side temperatures on the planets considered; this reduces reliance on heat transport models to explain the night-side temperature for the few exemplar rocky close-in planets, namely K2-141 b, 55 Cancri e, TOI-561 b, TOI-431 b, and Kepler-10 b, that are discussed in this work. We provide improved day-night contrast temperatures, considering an airless scenario, and highlight the need for revisiting the heat transport models associated with atmospheric modelling of planets where the night-side illumination is significant.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.14214v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Binary stars are as common as single stars. The number of detected planets orbiting binaries is rapidly increasing thanks to the synergy between transit surveys, Gaia and high-resolution direct imaging campaigns. However, global planet formation models around binary stars are still underdeveloped, which limits the theoretical understanding of planets orbiting binary star systems. Hereby we introduce the PAIRS project, which aims at building a global planet formation model for planets in binaries, and to produce planet populations synthesis to statistically compare theory and observations. In this first paper, we present the adaptation of the circumstellar disc to simulate the formation of S-type planets. The presence of a secondary star tidally truncates and heats the outer part of the circumprimary disc (and vice-versa for the circumsecondary disc), limiting the material to form planets. We implement and quantify this effect for a range of binary parameters by adapting the Bern Model of planet formation in its pebble-based form and for in-situ planet growth. We find that the disc truncation has a strong impact on reducing the pebble supply for core growth, steadily suppressing planet formation for binary separations below 160 au, when considering all the formed planets more massive than Mars. We find as well that S-type planets tend to form close to the central star with respect to the binary separation and disc truncation radius. Our newly developed model will be the basis of future S-type planet population synthesis studies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.12861v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Context. Understanding the survival and orbital evolution of brown dwarf (BD) companions during the post-main-sequence (MS) evolution of their host stars is increasingly important, especially with recent discoveries of many substellar companions around white dwarfs (WDs). Aims. We investigate the long-term evolution and final outcomes of BDs orbiting low-mass MS stars as these evolve into WDs. By comparing forward-modeling populations with observed WD-BD binaries, we test evolutionary models and predict the existence of yet-undetected systems. Methods. We employ the COMPAS binary population synthesis code to evolve observed MS-BD systems through the post-MS phases of their host stars into the WD stage, tracking orbital changes driven by mass loss, tides, and common-envelope (CE) evolution. Results. Our simulations reproduce a period gap in the distribution of detached WD-BD binaries, consistent with observations. We also identify a boundary separating detached and semi-detached systems on the period-mass diagram, located at orbital periods of $\sim$1-2 hours depending on the BD mass. Conclusions. We predict that a subset of currently known MS-BD binaries will survive post-MS evolution and emerge as detached WD-BD systems, while others will undergo CE evolution and potentially form cataclysmic variables with BD donors. Our results reproduce the observed period gap in WD-BD binaries and provide quantitative predictions for the role of CE efficiency in shaping their distribution. This work predicts that many WD-BD systems remain undetected, motivating targeted searches with microlensing and high-contrast imaging techniques using next-generation large telescopes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.13367v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Stochastic resetting describes dynamics which are reinitialized to a reference state at random times. These protocols are attracting significant interest: they can stabilize nonequilibrium stationary states, generate correlations in noninteracting systems, and enable optimal search strategies. While a constant reset probability results in a Markovian dynamics, much less is known about non-Markovian effects in quantum stochastic resetting. Here, we analyze memory effects in these processes -- examining the evolution of quantum states and of observables -- through witnesses of non-Markovianity for open quantum systems. We focus on discrete-time reset processes, which are of particular interest as they can be implemented on existing gate-operated quantum devices. We show that these processes are generically described by non-divisible maps and, in non-classical scenarios where the effective reset probability can become negative, can feature revivals in the state distinguishability. Our results reveal non-Markovian effects in quantum stochastic resetting and show that a time-dependent reset may be exploited to engineer enhanced stationary quantum correlations.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.12935v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Fluctuation-induced forces, such as the Critical Casimir Effect (CCE), are fundamental mechanisms driving organization and self-assembly near second-order phase transitions. The existence of a comparable, universal force for systems undergoing a first-order transition has remained an unresolved fundamental question. The proposed Orderphobic Effect is one such potential mechanism. It arises from minimisation of the interfacial free energy between solutes that locally nucleate a disordered phase. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration and quantitative measurement of the Orderphobic Effect. Using a driven, non-equilibrium quasi-2D granular fluid undergoing a first-order order-disorder transition, we show that specifically designed solutes in an ordered phase nucleate a coexisting ``bubble&#x27;&#x27; of the disordered phase. By analysing its capillary fluctuations, we confirm that this phenomenon occurs due to the proximity to phase-coexistence, and we directly quantify the attractive force by measuring the interaction free energy between solutes. The observation of this general fluctuation-mediated force in a non-equilibrium steady state strongly supports its claimed universality. Our work establishes the Orderphobic Effect as the first-order equivalent to the CCE, providing a new, general route for controlling self-assembly and aggregation in soft matter and non-equilibrium systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2510.06939v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: K2-18b lies near the radius valley that separates super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, marking a key transitional regime in planetary and atmospheric composition. The system offers a valuable opportunity to study how M-dwarf high-energy stellar radiation influences atmospheric stability and the potential for sustaining volatile species, especially important in the context of the upcoming ELT and its ANDES spectrograph. This study characterizes the high-energy environment of K2-18 with X-ray observations from eROSITA, the soft X-ray instrument on the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission, Chandra, and XMM-Newton. We derive a representative 0.2-2 keV X-ray flux with an APEC thermal plasma model fitted with the Bayesian X-ray Analysis (BXA). With the observed X-ray flux from the exoplanet host star, we estimate the photoevaporative mass loss of exoplanet K2-18b using the energy-limited model. In addition, we examine the thermal structure of the system based on a hydrodynamic model. In 100 ks XMM-Newton observation we identified K2-18 as a very faint X-ray source with $\mathrm{F_X = 10^{-15}\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, with an activity level of (Lx/Lbol) $\sim 10^{-5}$. A small flare has been detected during the observation. The planet is irradiated by an X-ray flux of $\mathrm{F_{pl,X} = 12\pm3\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$. The X-ray flux measurement of K2-18 gives important limitations for atmospheric escape and photochemical modeling of its exoplanets. Despite its near orbit around an M-dwarf star, K2-18b&#x27;s low activity level environment suggests that it can retain an atmosphere, supporting recent tentative detections of atmospheres.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.13038v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Mean-field Hartree theory is a central tool for reducing interacting many-body dynamics to an effective nonlinear one-particle evolution. This approximation has been employed also when the Hamiltonian that governs the many-body dynamics is not Hermitian. Indeed, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians model particle gain/loss or the evolution of open quantum systems between consecutive quantum jumps. Furthermore, the validity of the Hartree approximation for generic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians lies at the basis of a quantum algorithm for nonlinear differential equations. In this work, we show that this approximation can fail. We analytically solve a model of $N$ bosonic qubits with two-body interactions generated by a purely anti-Hermitian Hamiltonian, determine an analytic expression for the limit for $N\to\infty$ of the one-particle marginal state and show that such a limit does not agree with the solution of the non-Hermitian Hartree evolution equation. We further show that there exists an initial condition such that the exact one-particle marginal state undergoes a finite-time transition to a mixed state, a phenomenon that is completely absent in the case of Hermitian Hamiltonians. Our findings challenge the validity of the mean-field Hartree approximation for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, and call for additional conditions for the validity of the mean-field regime to model the dynamics of particle gain and loss and the open-system dynamics in bosonic many-body systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.12214v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Nanocrystals (NCs) serve as versatile building blocks for the creation of functional materials, with NC self-assembly offering opportunities to enable novel material properties. Here, we demonstrate that PbS NCs functionalized with strongly negatively charged metal chalcogenide complex (MCC) ligands, such as $Sn_2S_6^{4-}$ and $AsS_4^{3-}$, can self-assemble into all-inorganic superlattices with both long-range superlattice translational and atomic-lattice orientational order. Structural characterizations reveal that the NCs adopt unexpected edge-to-edge alignment, and numerical simulation clarifies that orientational order is thermodynamically stabilized by many-body ion correlations originating from the dense electrolyte. Furthermore, we show that the superlattices of $Sn_2S_6^{4-}$-functionalized PbS NCs can be fully disassembled back into the colloidal state, which is highly unusual for orientationally attached superlattices with atomic-lattice alignment. The reversible oriented attachment of NCs, enabling their dynamic assembly and disassembly into effectively single-crystalline superstructures, offers a pathway toward designing reconfigurable materials with adaptive and controllable electronic and optoelectronic properties.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2510.03159v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We identify the mechanism of slow heterogeneous relaxation in quantum kinetically constrained models (KCMs) in which the potential energy strength is controlled by a coupling parameter. The regime of slow relaxation includes the large-coupling limit. By expanding around that limit, we reveal a \emph{nested hierarchy} of states that remain frozen on time scales determined by powers of the coupling. The classification of such states, together with the evolution of their Krylov complexity, reveals that these time scales are related to the distance between the sites where facilitated dynamics is allowed by the kinetic constraint. While correlations within frozen states relax slowly and exhibit metastable plateaus that persist on time scales set by powers of the coupling parameter, the correlations in the rest of the states decay rapidly. We compute the plateau heights of correlations across all frozen states up to second-order corrections in the inverse coupling. Our results explain slow relaxation in quantum KCMs and elucidate dynamical heterogeneity by relating the relaxation times to the spatial separations between the active regions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2501.09544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: We present a method, based on the Keldysh formalism, for deriving stochastic master equations that describe the non-Markovian dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a Gaussian environment. This approach yields a compact expression for the system&#x27;s propagator, which we show to be equivalent to existing formulations, such as the stochastic von Neumann equation (SVNE). A key advantage of our method is its generality: It can be extended to describe any open-system evolution defined on a suitable ordering contour. As a result, we adapt it to derive generalized versions of the SVNE that account for initial system-environment correlations, as well as stochastic equations that incorporate information about the statistics of energy flows in the environment. The insights offered by our technique further allow us to examine the nature of the noise processes appearing in the SVNE. We prove that its solution can be expressed in terms of a single physical noise, without any loss of information. Finally, we propose a semiclassical scenario in which this noise can be interpreted as arising from an initial measurement process on the environment.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10409v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The evolution of an isolated quantum system inevitably exhibits recurrence: the state returns to the vicinity of its initial condition after finite time. Despite its fundamental nature, a rigorous quantitative understanding of recurrence has been lacking. We establish upper bounds on the recurrence time, $t_{\mathrm{rec}} \lesssim t_{\mathrm{exit}}(\epsilon)(1/\epsilon)^d$, where $d$ is the Hilbert-space dimension, $\epsilon$ the neighborhood size, and $t_{\mathrm{exit}}(\epsilon)$ the escape time from this neighborhood. For pure states evolving under a Hamiltonian $H$, estimating $t_{\mathrm{exit}}$ is equivalent to an inverse quantum speed limit problem: finding upper bounds on the time a time-evolved state $\psi_t$ needs to depart from the $\epsilon$-vicinity of the initial state $\psi_0$. We provide a partial solution, showing that under mild assumptions $t_{\mathrm{exit}}(\epsilon) \approx \epsilon /\sqrt{ \Delta(H^2)}$, with $\Delta(H^2)$ the Hamiltonian variance in $\psi_0$. We show that our upper bound on $t_{\mathrm{rec}}$ is generically saturated for random Hamiltonians. Finally, we analyze the impact of coherence of the initial state in the eigenbasis of $H$ on recurrence behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.13038v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Mean-field Hartree theory is a central tool for reducing interacting many-body dynamics to an effective nonlinear one-particle evolution. This approximation has been employed also when the Hamiltonian that governs the many-body dynamics is not Hermitian. Indeed, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians model particle gain/loss or the evolution of open quantum systems between consecutive quantum jumps. Furthermore, the validity of the Hartree approximation for generic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians lies at the basis of a quantum algorithm for nonlinear differential equations. In this work, we show that this approximation can fail. We analytically solve a model of $N$ bosonic qubits with two-body interactions generated by a purely anti-Hermitian Hamiltonian, determine an analytic expression for the limit for $N\to\infty$ of the one-particle marginal state and show that such a limit does not agree with the solution of the non-Hermitian Hartree evolution equation. We further show that there exists an initial condition such that the exact one-particle marginal state undergoes a finite-time transition to a mixed state, a phenomenon that is completely absent in the case of Hermitian Hamiltonians. Our findings challenge the validity of the mean-field Hartree approximation for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, and call for additional conditions for the validity of the mean-field regime to model the dynamics of particle gain and loss and the open-system dynamics in bosonic many-body systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11823v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We present a channel-resolved interpretation of laser-driven Coulomb explosion of the HCl dimer from an ensemble of trajectories. Three dominant outcomes are identified: a minor three-body channel and two four-body channels (sequential and near-simultaneous dissociation of both molecules). The key result is that pathway selection is strongly correlated with the degree of ionization during the laser interaction, which is in turn strongly modulated by laser-molecule orientation. Higher early-time ionization predisposes the system toward near-simultaneous four-body breakup, whereas lower ionization favors sequential and three-body fragmentation; for low-ionization cases, a fragment-resolved charge metric further differentiates three-body and sequential behavior. These charge-dependent trends consistently map onto experimentally accessible observables: the simultaneous mechanism dominates the high-energy tail of the kinetic energy release (KER) spectrum and populate distinct regions of the emission-angle distributions, while sequential events concentrate at lower KER. Overall, early-time charge evolution provides a unifying explanation for channel branching and for the channel-resolved fragmentation signatures.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2505.23430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: With an increasing interest in the design of long and complex space missions, the search for orbits that require the least amount of fuel is of fundamental interest. This paper develops existing computational models for locating Unstable Periodic Orbits (UPOs) in polynomial dynamical systems using Sum-of-Squares (SOS) optimization technique and proposes a numerical framework to converge UPOs for the Planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (PCR3BP) in astrodynamics. This is done by developing the polynomial SOS optimization technique with extension to systems with non-polynomial and Hamiltonian dynamics. First, we demonstrate and exploit the dependency of convergence of tight bounds on an observable of interest with varying scaling factors for large polynomial degrees. SOS optimization is then used to compute nonnegative polynomials, the minimization sublevel sets of which, approximately localise parts of the corresponding UPO. Improvements in current non-linear optimization techniques are suggested to compute a large number of points inside the relevant sublevel sets. Such points provide good initial conditions for UPO computations with existing algorithms. The distinguishing feature of such UPOs is that they optimize the long-time average of an input observable of interest which is a function of state variables. For the PCR3BP this means that such orbits in space can be traversed indefinitely in time without continuous fuel expenditure. As practical applications to space mission designs, we converge UPOs that minimise transmitted power required by satellites for the Earth-Moon system in a communication relay problem by minimizing the infinite-time average of sum of squares of distances of a satellite from Earth and the Moon.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Uses multiconformer X‑ray crystallographic ensembles to predict protein–ligand binding entropy (including solvent water contributions), offering broadly relevant biophysical insight but limited direct connection to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein-ligand binding is governed by free energy, comprising both enthalpic and entropic contributions. Yet structural interpretations of binding thermodynamics have predominantly focused on enthalpic interactions, largely neglecting entropy because it is difficult to quantify from static structural models. Here, we developed multiconformer ensemble models to analyze high-resolution X-ray crystallography structures and estimate both protein and solvent conformational entropies. These ensemble models successfully predicted experimental binding entropies measured by isothermal titration calorimetry for over 70 protein-ligand pairs across 12 proteins, revealing a strong linear correlation. Protein entropy, estimated using crystallographic order parameters that capture both harmonic and anharmonic motion, correlates linearly with experimental binding entropy. Incorporating resolution-corrected differences in water-molecule counts substantially improves predictions, demonstrating that protein and solvent contributions must be considered jointly. Analysis of water-protein hydrogen bonding networks partially explains entropic differences across complexes. These results establish that crystallographic ensembles can quantify binding entropy, enabling explicit entropic considerations in structure-based studies of molecular recognition for both functional analysis and drug design.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces an LLM agent that interfaces with AVEVA Process Simulation to build, analyze, and optimize chemical process flowsheets via natural language, demonstrated on water–methanol separations, but with no direct origins-of-life or astrobiology focus.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11650v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Modern process simulators enable detailed process design, simulation, and optimization; however, constructing and interpreting simulations is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. This limits early exploration by inexperienced users. To address this, a large language model (LLM) agent is integrated with AVEVA Process Simulation (APS) via Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing natural language interaction with rigorous process simulations. An MCP server toolset enables the LLM to communicate programmatically with APS using Python, allowing it to execute complex simulation tasks from plain-language instructions. Two water-methanol separation case studies assess the framework across different task complexities and interaction modes. The first shows the agent autonomously analyzing flowsheets, finding improvement opportunities, and iteratively optimizing, extracting data, and presenting results clearly. The framework benefits both educational purposes, by translating technical concepts and demonstrating workflows, and experienced practitioners by automating data extraction, speeding routine tasks, and supporting brainstorming. The second case study assesses autonomous flowsheet synthesis through both a step-by-step dialogue and a single prompt, demonstrating its potential for novices and experts alike. The step-by-step mode gives reliable, guided construction suitable for educational contexts; the single-prompt mode constructs fast baseline flowsheets for later refinement. While current limitations such as oversimplification, calculation errors, and technical hiccups mean expert oversight is still needed, the framework&#x27;s capabilities in analysis, optimization, and guided construction suggest LLM-based agents can become valuable collaborators.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2412.15889v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: When numerically simulating the unitary time evolution of an infinite-dimensional quantum system, one is usually led to treat the Hamiltonian $H$ as an &quot;infinite-dimensional matrix&quot; by expressing it in some orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space, and then truncate it to some finite dimensions. However, the solutions of the Schr\&quot;odinger equations generated by the truncated Hamiltonians need not converge, in general, to the solution of the Schr\&quot;odinger equation corresponding to the actual Hamiltonian. In this paper we demonstrate that, under mild assumptions, they converge to the solution of the Schr\&quot;odinger equation generated by a specific Hamiltonian which crucially depends on the particular choice of basis: the Friedrichs extension of the restriction of $H$ to the space of finite linear combinations of elements of the basis. Importantly, this is generally different from $H$ itself; in all such cases, numerical simulations will unavoidably reproduce the wrong dynamics in the limit, and yet there is no numerical test that can reveal this failure, unless one has the analytical solution to compare with. As a practical demonstration of such results, we consider the quantum particle in the box, and we show that, for a wide class of bases (which include associated Legendre polynomials as a concrete example) the dynamics generated by the truncated Hamiltonians will always converge to the one corresponding to the particle with Dirichlet boundary conditions, regardless the initial choice of boundary conditions. Other such examples are discussed.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> The paper rigorously analyzes and remedies fermion doubling in quantum cellular automata for lattice simulations of chiral fermions, which is largely unrelated to origins-of-life research aside from a superficial link to the concept of chirality.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2505.07900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: A Quantum Cellular Automaton (QCA) is essentially an operator driving the evolution of particles on a lattice, through local unitaries. Because $\Delta_t=\Delta_x = \epsilon$, QCAs constitute a privileged framework to cast the digital quantum simulation of relativistic quantum particles and their interactions with gauge fields, e.g., $(3+1)$D Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). But before they can be adopted, simulation schemes for high-energy physics need prove themselves against specific numerical issues, of which the most infamous is Fermion Doubling (FD). FD is well understood in particular in the real-time, discrete-space \emph{but} continuous-time settings of Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs), as the appearance of spurious solutions for all $\Delta_x=\epsilon\neq 0$. We rigorously extend this analysis to the real-time, discrete-space \emph{and} discrete-time schemes that QCAs are. We demonstrate the existence of FD issues in QCAs for $\Delta_t =\Delta_x = \epsilon \neq 0$. By applying a covering map on the Brillouin zone, we provide a flavor-staggering-only way of fixing FD that does not break the chiral symmetry of the massless scheme. We explain how this method coexists with the Nielsen-Ninomiya no-go theorem, and give an example of neutrino-like QCA showing that our model allows to put chiral fermions interacting via the weak interaction on a spacetime lattice, without running into any FD problem.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.12477v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Single-atom catalysts (SACs) maximize atom efficiency and exhibit unique electronic structures, yet realizing precise and scalable atomic dispersion remains a key challenge. Here, we report a non-equilibrium strategy for the scalable synthesis of SACs via ion implantation, enabling precise stabilization of metal atoms on diverse supports. Using an industrial-grade ion source, wafer-scale ion implantation with milliampere-level beam currents enables high-throughput fabrication of SACs, while the synergistic energy-mass effects stabilize isolated metal atoms in situ. A library of 36 SACs was constructed, and the resulting Pt/MoS2 exhibits outstanding hydrogen evolution performance with an overpotential of only 26 mV at 10 mA cm-2 and exceptional long-term stability, surpassing commercial Pt/C. This work demonstrates ion implantation as a versatile platform bridging fundamental SACs design and scalable manufacturing, providing new opportunities for high-performance catalysts in energy conversion applications.</p>

Here, we demonstrate that PbS NCs functionalized with strongly negatively charged metal chalcogenide complex (MCC) ligands, such as $Sn_2S_6^{4-}$ and $AsS_4^{3-}$, can self-assemble into all-inorganic superlattices with both long-range superlattice translational and atomic-lattice orientational order. Structural characterizations reveal that the NCs adopt unexpected edge-to-edge alignment, and numerical simulation clarifies that orientational order is thermodynamically stabilized by many-body ion correlations originating from the dense electrolyte. Furthermore, we show that the superlattices of $Sn_2S_6^{4-}$-functionalized PbS NCs can be fully disassembled back into the colloidal state, which is highly unusual for orientationally attached superlattices with atomic-lattice alignment. The reversible oriented attachment of NCs, enabling their dynamic assembly and disassembly into effectively single-crystalline superstructures, offers a pathway toward designing reconfigurable materials with adaptive and controllable electronic and optoelectronic properties.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.12029v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation serves as a foundational model in nonlinear wave physics, describing the balance between dispersive spreading and nonlinear steepening that gives rise to solitons. This article introduces sangkuriang, an open-source Python library for solving this equation using Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization coupled with adaptive high-order time integration. The implementation leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation for computational efficiency while maintaining accessibility for instructional purposes. Validation encompasses progressively complex scenarios including isolated soliton propagation, symmetric two-wave configurations, overtaking collisions between waves of differing amplitudes, and three-body interactions. Conservation of the classical invariants is monitored throughout, with deviations remaining small across all test cases. Measured soliton velocities conform closely to theoretical predictions based on the amplitude-velocity relationship characteristic of integrable systems. Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics. The solver outputs data in standard scientific formats compatible with common analysis tools and generates visualizations of spatiotemporal wave evolution. By combining numerical accuracy with practical accessibility on modest computational resources, sangkuriang offers a platform suitable for both classroom demonstrations of nonlinear wave phenomena and exploratory research into soliton dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2506.04885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Chiral structures that produce asymmetric spin-phonon coupling can theoretically generate spin-phonon polarons -- quasiparticles exhibiting non-degenerate spin states with phonon displacements. These quasiparticles are speculated to be the origin of chirality-induced spin selectivity and presumably can display exotic dynamic behaviors. However, direct experimental evidence of spin-phonon polarons has been lacking. Using a chiral molecular qubit framework embedding stable semiquinone-like radicals, we report spin dynamic signatures that indicate the formation of spin-phonon polarons for the first time. Our non-adiabatic model reveals that these quasiparticles introduce an active spin relaxation channel when polaron reorganization energy approaches Zeeman splitting. This new channel manifests itself as anomalous, temperature-independent spin relaxation, which can be suppressed by high magnetic fields or pore-filling solvents (e.g. CH2Cl2, CS2). Such field- and guest-tunable relaxation is unattainable in conventional spin systems. Harnessing this mechanism could boost repetition rates in spin-based quantum information technologies without compromising coherence or quantum sensing performance.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11721v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Two-phase surfactant-laden flow and transport in porous media are central to many natural and engineering applications. Surfactants alter two-phase flow by modifying interfacial tension and wettability, while two-phase flow controls surfactant transport pathways and interfacial adsorption. These coupled processes are commonly modeled using Darcy-type two-phase flow equations combined with advection--dispersion--adsorption transport equations, with capillary pressure--saturation relationships scaled by the Leverett $J$-function. However, the Leverett $J$-function idealizes porous media as bundles of cylindrical tubes and decouples interfacial tension and wettability, limiting its ability to represent angular pore geometries and interfacial tension--wettability coupling effects. We present a modeling framework that explicitly incorporates pore angularity and interfacial tension--wettability coupling into Darcy-scale surfactant-laden flow and transport models. Two-phase flow properties are derived for angular pores, upscaled across pore size distributions, and formulated as explicit and closed-form expressions. These upscaled relationships are integrated into a coupled flow--transport model to simulate transient two-phase flow and surfactant transport. Results reveal a nonlinear and nonmonotonic dependence of two-phase flow properties on pore angularity, pore size distribution, and interfacial tension. Example simulations of water flow and PFAS migration in unsaturated soils indicate that surfactant-induced flow effects on PFAS leaching are generally minor under typical conditions, whereas pore angularity strongly controls water flow, interfacial area, and PFAS retention. Overall, the proposed framework provides a more physically grounded approach for modeling two-phase surfactant-laden flow and transport in porous media.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.12570v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Alumina and aluminum oxyhydroxides underpin chemical-engineering technologies from heterogeneous catalysis, corrosion protection, functional coatings, energy-storage devices, to biomedical components. Yet molecular models that predictively connect phase structure, pH-dependent surface chemistry, electrolyte organization, and adsorption across operating conditions remain limited. Here we introduce a unified INTERFACE Force Field (IFF) parameterization together with a curated, ready-to-use pH-resolved surface model database that provides the most accurate and transferable atomistic description of major alumina phases to date. The framework covers a-Al2O3, g-Al2O3, boehmite, diaspore, and gibbsite using a single, physically interpretable parameter set that is directly compatible with CHARMM, AMBER, OPLS-AA, CVFF, and PCFF. Across structural, thermodynamic, mechanical, and interfacial benchmarks, simulations reproduce experimental reference data with more than 95 percent accuracy, exceeding existing force fields and the reliability of current density-functional approaches. A key advance is the first transferable treatment of surface ionization and charge regulation across alumina phases over a broad range of pH values, enabling simulations of realistic solid electrolyte interfaces without phase-specific reparameterization. Quantitative reliability is demonstrated by reproducing trends in zeta potentials and pH-dependent adsorption of a corrosion inhibitor at alumina-water interfaces. Predicted adsorption free energies and surface contact times correlate with experiments across more than an order of magnitude. Relative to ML-DFT workflows, the speed 100 to 1000 times faster, reaching system sizes and time scales inaccessible to quantum methods. The results establish a predictive computational platform to design alumina-containing functional materials under realistic process conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2412.06631v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have recently been extensively applied to model the time-evolution in fluid dynamics, weather predictions, and even chaotic systems thanks to their ability to capture temporal dependencies and sequential patterns in data. Here we present a RNN model based on convolution neural networks for modeling the nonlinear non-adiabatic dynamics of hybrid quantum-classical systems. The dynamical evolution of the hybrid systems is governed by equations of motion for classical degrees of freedom and von Neumann equation for electrons. The physics-aware recurrent convolution (PARC) neural network structure incorporates a differentiator-integrator architecture that inductively models the spatiotemporal dynamics of generic physical systems. We apply our RNN approach to learn the space-time evolution of a one-dimensional semi-classical Holstein model after an interaction quench. For shallow quenches (small changes in electron-lattice coupling), the deterministic dynamics can be accurately captured using a single-CNN-based recurrent network. In contrast, deep quenches induce chaotic evolution, making long-term trajectory prediction significantly more challenging. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the PARC-CNN architecture can effectively learn the statistical climate of the Holstein model under deep-quench conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2406.04307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Estimating the eigenstate properties of quantum systems is a long-standing, challenging problem for both classical and quantum computing. Existing universal quantum algorithms typically rely on ideal and efficient query models (e.g. time evolution operator or block encoding of the Hamiltonian), which, however, become suboptimal for actual implementation at the quantum circuit level. Here, we present a full-stack design of quantum algorithms for estimating the eigenenergy and eigenstate properties, which can achieve high precision and good scaling with system size. The gate complexity per circuit for estimating generic Hamiltonians&#x27; eigenstate properties is $\tilde{O} (\log \varepsilon^{-1})$, which has a logarithmic dependence on the inverse precision $\varepsilon$. For lattice Hamiltonians, the circuit depth of our design achieves near-optimal system-size scaling, even with local qubit connectivity. Our full-stack algorithm has low overhead in circuit compilation, which thus results in a small actual gate count (CNOT and non-Clifford gates) for lattice and molecular problems compared to advanced eigenstate algorithms. The algorithm is implemented on IBM quantum devices using up to 2,000 two-qubit gates and 20,000 single-qubit gates, and achieves high-precision eigenenergy estimation for Heisenberg-type Hamiltonians, demonstrating its noise robustness.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.12005v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The exploration of vast genotype spaces poses fundamental challenges for evolving populations. As the number of genotypes encoding viable phenotypes grows exponentially with genome length, populations can only explore a tiny fraction of these immense spaces, a fact consistently supported by empirical and theoretical evidence. Paradoxically, local, mutation-driven searches near abundant sequences allow populations to generate phenotypic improvements and functional innovations despite this immense search space. In this contribution, we integrate insights from viral evolution with theoretical expectations derived from genotype-phenotype maps to re-examine how high-dimensional sequence spaces shape evolutionary dynamics. In resolving the paradox, abundant phenotypes play a crucial role because their combinatorial weight biases evolutionary trajectories. We discuss how this bias, together with limited accessibility of fitness peaks, modifies traditional metaphors -- such as fitness landscapes -- and challenges standard notions of evolutionary optimality. Our results underscore that adaptation is predominantly local yet remarkably efficient, providing a unifying perspective on the coexistence of robustness, innovation, and constrained exploration in molecular evolution.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2506.05477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Numerical simulations of turbulent fluids are paramount to real-life applications, from predicting and modeling flows to diagnostic purposes in engineering. However, they are also computationally challenging due to their intrinsically non-linear dynamics, which require a very high spatial resolution to accurately describe them. A promising idea is to represent flows on a discrete mesh using tensor trains (TTs), featuring a convenient scaling of the number of parameters with the mesh size. However, it is unclear how the compression power of TTs is affected by the complexity of the flows, as measured by the Reynolds number. In fact, no comprehensive analysis of how the TT representation affects the turbulent properties has yet been carried out. We fill this gap by analyzing TTs as an Ansatz to compress, simulate, and generate 3D snapshots with turbulent-like features. Specifically, we first investigate the effect of TT compression on key turbulence signatures, such as the energy spectrum, the PDF of velocity increments, and flatness. Second, we extend the 2D TT-solver introduced in [1] to a 3D cubic domain with periodic boundary conditions. We use it to simulate the incompressible Navier-Stokes dynamics at $Re_{\lambda}=315$ for a total of 9-10 Kolmogorov turnover times, showcasing the numerical stability of the TT-solver in fully developed turbulent regimes. Third, we develop a TT algorithm to synthesize artificial snapshots that exhibit turbulent-like features, with a logarithmic cost in the mesh size. Our analysis demonstrates the ability of the TT representation to capture the characteristic features of turbulence. This offers a powerful quantum-inspired toolkit for the computational treatment of turbulent flows.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2501.07379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: The coupling between evolutionary and ecological changes (eco-evolutionary dynamics) has been shown to be relevant among diverse species, and is also of interest outside of ecology, i.e. in cancer evolution. These dynamics play an important role in determining survival in response to climate change, motivating the need for mathematical models to capture this often complex interplay. Models incorporating eco-evolutionary dynamics often sacrifice analytical tractability to capture the complexity of real systems, do not explicitly consider the effect of population heterogeneity, or focus on long-term behaviour. In order to capture population heterogeneity, both transient, and long-term dynamics, while retaining tractability, we generalise a moment-based method applicable in the regime of small segregational variance to the case of time-dependent mortality and birth. These results are applied to a predator-prey model, where ecological parameters such as the contact rate between species are trait-structured. The trait-distribution of the prey species is shown to be approximately Gaussian with constant variance centered on the mean trait, which is asymptotically governed by an autonomous ODE. In this way, we make explicit the impact of eco-evolutionary dynamics on the transient behaviour and long-term fate of the prey species.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.13010v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Evolutionary accumulation models (EvAMs) are an emerging class of machine learning methods designed to infer the evolutionary pathways by which features are acquired. Applications include cancer evolution (accumulation of mutations), anti-microbial resistance (accumulation of drug resistances), genome evolution (organelle gene transfers), and more diverse themes in biology and beyond. Following these themes, many EvAMs assume that features are gained irreversibly -- no loss of features can occur. Reversible approaches do exist but are often computationally (much) more demanding and statistically less stable. Our goal here is to explore whether useful information about evolutionary dynamics which are in reality reversible can be obtained from modelling approaches with an assumption of irreversibility. We identify, and use simulation studies to quantify, errors involved in neglecting reversible dynamics, and show the situations in which approximate results from tractable models can be informative and reliable. In particular, EvAM inferences about the relative orderings of acquisitions, and the core dynamic structure of evolutionary pathways, are robust to reversibility in many cases, while estimations of uncertainty and feature interactions are more error-prone.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.13442v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The grandmother hypothesis is the most influential account of the evolution of menopause in humans, but other theories warrant investigation. Here I use simulations to investigate two theories that ground the evolution of menopause in biparental care. Kaplan et al. (2010) proposed a &quot;two-sex&quot; learning and skill-based account, termed the Embodied Capital Model (ECM), in which the high energetic burden of caring for multiple, slow-developing offspring was met with biparental investment. Menopause evolved because the physiological costs of pregnancy and childbirth increased with age yet productivity also increased with age, and the benefits of transferring resources to adult children and their offspring eventually outweigh the benefits of continued reproduction. Kuhle (2007) proposed the &quot;father absent&quot; hypothesis in which the higher mortality rate of husbands would often have left wives without the resources to raise young children, selecting for early reproductive cessation in monogamous couples. Simulations of hunter-gatherer energy consumption and production across the lifespan, taking account of age- and sex-specific survivorship, interbirth intervals, and varying rates of strength and foraging skill acquisition typical of contemporary foragers, reveal a pronounced midlife energy deficit that could be averted by ceasing reproduction midlife and receiving energy transfers from both younger couples (e.g., brideservice) and from older parents (the grandmother hypothesis).

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11859v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The evolution toward 6G networks increasingly relies on network slicing to provide tailored, End-to-End (E2E) logical networks over shared physical infrastructures. A critical challenge is effectively decomposing E2E Service Level Agreements (SLAs) into domain-specific SLAs, which current solutions handle through computationally intensive, iterative optimization processes that incur substantial latency and complexity. To address this, we introduce Casformer, a cascaded Transformer architecture designed for fast, optimization-free SLA decomposition. Casformer leverages historical domain feedback encoded through domain-specific Transformer encoders in its first layer, and integrates cross-domain dependencies using a Transformer-based aggregator in its second layer. The model is trained under a learning paradigm inspired by Domain-Informed Neural Networks (DINNs), incorporating risk-informed modeling and amortized optimization to learn a stable, forward-only SLA decomposition policy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Casformer achieves improved SLA decomposition quality against state-of-the-art optimization-based frameworks, while exhibiting enhanced scalability and robustness under volatile and noisy network conditions. In addition, its forward-only design reduces runtime complexity and simplifies deployment and maintenance. These insights reveal the potential of combining amortized optimization with Transformer-based sequence modeling to advance network automation, providing a scalable and efficient solution suitable for real-time SLA management in advanced 5G-and-beyond network environments.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study clarifies how the DNA glycosylase NEIL3 can unhook endogenous abasic-site interstrand crosslinks without creating strand breaks, reconciling conflicting biochemical vs cellular models of replication-coupled DNA crosslink repair.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Abasic (Ap) sites arise frequently in genomic DNA and can form interstrand crosslinks (Ap-ICLs) that block DNA replication and threaten genome stability. The DNA glycosylase NEIL3 is required for replication-coupled repair of Ap-ICLs, yet its catalytic mechanism has remained unclear, as biochemical studies report lyase-dependent strand cleavage whereas cellular systems indicate incision-free unhooking. Here, we show that the catalytic outcome of NEIL3 is determined by the N-terminal processing of its NEI domain. Using biochemically and structurally defined NEI variants, we demonstrate that a native-like processed form (V2M), in which valine 2 is replaced by an initiating methionine, efficiently unhooks Ap-ICLs by releasing the crosslinked strand without generating toxic DNA strand breaks, and without {beta}- or {delta}-elimination. In contrast, an unprocessed form (M1) exhibits elevated Ap-lyase activity and generates strand breaks. Time-resolved Schiff-base trapping in the presence of a reducing agent reveals distinct high-molecular-weight intermediates during Ap-ICL unhooking. A crystal structure of NEIL3 bound to native-like substrate in form of a single-stranded DNA identifies features underlying its preference for fork-like substrates. Together, these findings reconcile previously conflicting models of NEIL3 function and define a mechanistic framework for replication-coupled repair of endogenous crosslinks, Ap-ICL, preserving fork integrity.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces PCRD-seq, an enrichment-free proximity crosslinking method to profile chromatin-associated RNAs from low-input cells, enabling subnuclear transcriptome studies but with only indirect relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chromatin-associated RNAs play critical roles in regulating chromatin organization and transcription, underscoring the importance of their study. Proximity labeling has emerged as a promising and versatile technique for profiling chromatin-associated RNAs with high spatiotemporal resolution. While being a powerful technique, traditional proximity labeling methods depend on complex, high-input enrichment protocols, which significantly limit their wide practical application. Here, we developed a straightforward, enrichment-free chromatin-associated RNA profiling strategy: Proximity Crosslinking-induced RNA Depletion sequencing (PCRD-seq). This approach leverages the proximity crosslinking between chromatin and its surrounding RNAs induced by singlet oxygen generated by HoeDBF, a photosensitizer targeting chromatin region. The proximity crosslinking hinders the release of chromatin-associated RNAs during routine TRIzol extraction, consequently leading to a specific depletion of these RNAs. This method was successfully applied to investigate the role of U1 snRNA in RNA chromatin retention and the differences in chromatin-associated transcriptomes between two ovarian cancer cell lines with opposite metastatic capability. Moreover, our PCRD-seq exhibits potential in profiling nuclear lamina-associated RNAs, which paves the way for its application to profile RNAs associated with other chromatin subdomains. The minimal cell input and simple workflow endow PCRD-seq as a transformative tool for wide applications.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study elucidates a reversible antitoxin-triggered auto-phosphorylation mechanism that inactivates the AbiEii nucleotidyltransferase toxin in Streptococcus agalactiae, reclassifying AbiE as a Type VII toxin–antitoxin system with implications for understanding regulatory control of DNA/RNA-associated enzymes.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nucleotidyltransferases (NTases) control diverse physiological processes, including DNA replication and repair, antibiotic resistance, and RNA modification. The Streptococcus agalactiae abortive infection family toxin, AbiEii, belongs to the DUF1814 superfamily of NTases and blocks bacterial growth through an as yet unknown mechanism. Antitoxin AbiEi has been reported to antagonize AbiEii as part of a Type IV toxin-antitoxin system. Here, we demonstrate through structural, biochemical, and biophysical studies that AbiEi binds to AbiEii to form a stable toxin-antitoxin complex in solution. Antitoxin binding ultimately leads to AbiEii auto-phosphorylation and an abolition of NTase activity. These data reclassify AbiE systems as Type VII toxin-antitoxin systems. Toxin phosphorylation appears to be a dynamic and reversible process, and we show that the sole serine/threonine phosphatase SaSTP of S. agalactiae can efficiently dephosphorylate AbiEii in vitro. Mutagenesis studies and functional assays indicate that a widespread mechanism of toxin auto-phosphorylation accounts for AbiEii neutralization, further supporting recent hypotheses outlining control of homologous MenAT toxin-antitoxin systems from Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become an essential technology for dissecting cellular heterogeneity in complex biological systems, with Illumina platforms serving as the dominant NGS provider. The recent emergence of the Ultima Genomics UG 100 platform offers a high-throughput and potentially more cost-effective alternative, warranting a rigorous comparative analysis. Here, we conducted a comprehensive head-to-head comparison of the Ultima Genomics UG 100 and Illumina NovaSeq X Plus platforms, generating deep-coverage scRNA-seq data from human PBMCs and stimulated T-cell samples. Our multi-level analysis revealed highly concordant performance in both cell type identification and gene expression. We found that both platforms robustly captured all major immune lineages and demonstrated good transcriptional agreement. Minor observed discrepancies were primarily correlated with low UMI counts, suggesting stochastic biological effects rather than technical variance. Overall, our study establishes that the Ultima UG 100 delivers performance highly comparable to the Illumina NovaSeq X Plus for single-cell transcriptomics.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Viral protein biogenesis underpins every viral life cycle stage, and elucidating these processes could reveal fundamental principles of virus host interaction, and vulnerabilities amenable to therapeutic targeting. Here we apply biophysical, molecular, and cell biology techniques to investigate the insertion, folding, and oligomerization of the SARS CoV 2 M protein. We describe the sequential cotranslational insertion of the hydrophobic core, and demonstrate that the cytosolic C terminal domain undergoes slower adoption of its tertiary structure. Additionally, we characterize how the transmembrane domain bundle facilitates M protein oligomerization. Our results reveal a hydrophobic residue cluster that is essential for protein folding and co-translational dimerization. Additionally, we identify the cellular machinery responsible for targeting and inserting the M protein into the ER membrane, and chaperones and cofactors that may contribute to proper folding.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Neurons depend on tightly regulated positioning of cellular components to maintain long-distance signaling, but the mechanisms guiding specific mRNAs to distant regions remain unclear. Here we show that late endosomes function as selective RNA carriers in human motor neurons and uncover the molecular logic guiding their loading. Using APEX2-mediated proximity labeling, we identify the external transcriptome of RAB7A-positive endosomes and find a specific population of mRNAs enriched for endosomal, axonal and synaptic functions. We find that mRNAs enriched in RAB7A endosomes contain evolutionarily conserved 5&#x27;UTRs which act as localization signals, and that the RNA-binding protein GEMIN5 interacts with these regions to promote endosomal RNA recruitment. Finally, we show that in ALS-associated conditions there is a conspicuous loss of endosome-associated transcripts and the mislocalization of GEMIN5 from endosomes. These findings uncover fundamental principles of RNA compartmentalization and highlight endosomal mRNA loading as a vulnerable axis in neuronal homeostasis.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cell fate transitions rely on extensive transcriptional activation mediated by transcription factors, yet the equally important processes that ensure the selective removal of pre-existing mRNAs remain elusive. We uncover widespread formation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) during early-to-middle meiosis using quantitative RNA structure analysis, and validate hundreds of natural antisense transcripts (NATs) through long-read sequencing. These NATs are induced by meiosis-specific transcription factors, including Ndt80p, and pair with sense mRNAs to drive cytoplasmic aggregation of the resulting dsRNAs. These dsRNA aggregates are subsequently transported to the vacuole for clearance, likely via autophagy. This pathway selectively eliminates mRNAs before metaphase I, including NDJ1, which encodes a meiotic cohesion protein that would otherwise block chromosome segregation. Our study reveals a physiological role for large-scale dsRNA formation, and highlights a simple but powerful model: the same transcription factors that activate mRNAs required for a specific developmental stage also program the synthesis of NATs that promote removal of transcripts from the preceding stage, thereby driving bidirectional transcriptome reprogramming.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study uses cryoEM and biochemical/cellular assays to show how the autoimmune-linked MDA5 T331I mutation reduces ATPase-driven filament turnover on dsRNA, stabilizing MDA5–RNA complexes and causing constitutive interferon signaling, but it is only tangentially relevant to origins-of-life via general RNA/nucleic-acid biology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), a member of the RIG-I-like receptor family, is a cytoplasmic sensor essential for innate antiviral immunity. MDA5 distinguishes viral RNA from host RNA in part through its ATP hydrolysis activity, which promotes filament turnover on shorter endogenous dsRNAs. Here, we show that the gain-of-function T331I disease-linked mutation within the ATP binding pocket disrupts this balance, resulting in constitutive interferon signaling. Through a combination of cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM), biochemical assays, and cellular analyses, we reveal the extensive network of interactions that precisely position ATP for catalysis in the wild-type MDA5 ATP binding pocket, and also demonstrate that the T331I mutation impairs ATPase activity, thereby stabilizing MDA5-dsRNA complexes and leading to aberrant immune activation. These findings elucidate how MDA5 ATPase activity regulates antiviral specificity and prevents autoimmunity by controlling filament stability and downstream signaling, offering a mechanistic molecular explanation for disease pathogenesis.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study shows that the yeast RNA-binding proteins Loc1p and She2p form PUN motif-dependent liquid–liquid phase separated condensates with ASH1 mRNA, offering cell-biological insight into RNA–protein self-assembly and compartmentalization mechanisms with only indirect relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In eukaryotes, mRNA localization is a widespread mechanism of spatial gene regulation. Amongst the best-studied examples is the directional transport of ASH1 mRNA during mitosis of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. ASH1 mRNA is co-transcriptionally bound by the two RNA-binding proteins She2p and Loc1p and subsequently exported. In the cytoplasm, the adapter She3p binds to She2p forming an active transport complex with the myosin motor Myo4p to mediate actin-dependent transport into the daughter cell. Loc1p stays in the nucleus where it has a second function in ribosome biogenesis. In this study, we map the interaction surface of Loc1p on She2p and observe that it does not interfere with the RNA-binding interface of She2p. Analogous to a previous report on Loc1p and RNA, we could show that also Loc1p and She2p undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). This event is caused by electrostatic interactions and can be regulated by the phosphorylation-driven alteration of She2p&#x27;s oligomeric state. Furthermore, we observed that LLPS formation only requires the PUN motifs of Loc1p and that a ternary Loc1p-RNA-She2p complex also undergoes LLPS. In summary, our findings indicate that Loc1p co-transcriptionally recruits the nuclear ASH1 mRNA-She2p complex to LLPS, while the cytoplasmic Loc1p-lacking She2p-She3p-RNA transport complex does not form such LLPS.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> NASA’s SunRISE SmallSat radio interferometer will monitor solar radio bursts tied to energetic particle events, improving understanding of space-weather radiation that can influence planetary habitability and the radiation environment relevant to life’s emergence.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> When the six tiny spacecraft of NASA&#x27;s SunRISE (Sun Radio Interferometer Space Experiment) mission settle into their orbits high above Earth after launching later this year, they&#x27;ll function as one giant radio dish to track the rumbles of radio bursts coming from deep within the sun&#x27;s atmosphere, or corona. Those bursts are generated by solar energetic particle events that could, in extreme cases, irradiate unprotected astronauts and satellites; tracking the radio waves they generate with SunRISE will help scientists mitigate their effects.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Analytical and simulation work suggests there is an optimal chromatin (TAD) compaction/connectivity that speeds DNA-binding protein target search via intersegmental jumps, with human TAD connectivity clustering near the predicted optimum.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> by Shuvadip Dutta, Adarshkrishnan Rajakumar, Ranjith Padinhateeri, Mithun K. Mitra Protein molecules must efficiently locate specific DNA sequences within the densely packed chromatin of the cell nucleus. We investigate how the spatial organisation of chromatin, specifically into Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), fundamentally affects this search process. Using exact analytical theory and simulations of different models of chromatin, we show that target search within compact, highly connected chromatin domains can leverage intersegmental jumps to significantly decrease search times. Further, we show that there exists an optimal degree of polymer compaction that minimizes the search time for proteins to find their targets. We show that for highly folded domains, rather than bulk diffusion, intersegmental transfers – jumping between chromatin segments that are close together in space – drive the optimal search process. Remarkably, when we analyse 8,355 TAD structures across the human genome, we find that their natural connectivity matches with the theoretical optimum predicted by our model. The structural organisation within TADs significantly reduces protein search times far beyond what is achievable through classical facilitated diffusion. In essence, our work suggests that packaging of chromatin inside the nucleus has implications beyond spatial organisation, and is also intricately linked to dynamics of proteins inside the nuclear environment.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study maps how CK2-mediated phosphorylation of DEK at serines 287/288 controls its chromatin binding and compaction effects in melanoma subtypes, a cancer epigenetics result with minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life beyond a general DNA/chromatin connection.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The conserved multifunctional chromatin modulator and oncogene DEK exhibits context-dependent genomic binding and function, but how these activities are regulated in cancer remains poorly understood. Using multi-omics and biochemical approaches, we find that while DEK predominantly occupies promoter-proximal regions in HeLa cells and primary melanocytes, its chromatin binding is dramatically reduced in melanoma cell lines despite DEK overexpression. We attributed this to CK2-mediated phosphorylation, which governs DEK chromatin association and transcriptional output in a cell-type-specific manner. Phosphoproteomics identified 34 phosphorylation sites, including S287 and S288 within the DEK C-terminal DNA-binding domain. Strikingly, CK2 inhibition and concomitant loss of phosphorylation at S287/S288 triggered DEK redistribution to promoter regions, coinciding with transcriptional repression of oncogenic pathways and global chromatin compaction. Melanoma subtypes showed divergent responses: NRAS mutant cells displayed dynamic, phosphorylation-dependent DEK redistribution, whereas BRAF mutant cells lacked detectable DEK binding. Our work establishes DEK as a phosphorylation-sensitive regulator of chromatin states, with CK2-mediated modification orchestrating its tumor-specific regulatory functions. These findings nominate phospho DEK as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in melanoma and possibly other cancers.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study uses XL-MS and docking to model a 1:1 interaction between human p53 and Sirt1 that selectively deacetylates p53 (notably at K582), but it is largely unrelated to origins-of-life research beyond general protein–DNA regulation biochemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The NAD+-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) is known to regulate the tumor suppressor p53 via deacetylation, but the structural basis of the protein-protein interaction between full-length p53 and Sirt1 has so far remained elusive. We apply an integrated approach, combining structural mass spectrometry (MS) with data-driven molecular docking, to study the interaction between human p53 and Sirt1. Sirt1 was found to bind exclusively to acetylated p53 forming complexes with a 1:1 stoichiometry, irrespectively of p53&#x27;s oligomeric state. The lysine residue at position 582 (K582) in p53 was identified as predominant acetylation site showing a selective Sirt1-dependent deacetylation at this position. Cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) provided valuable distance constraints between p53 and Sirt1. Specifically, cross-links created between p53-K382 / Sirt1-K427 and p53-K120 / Sirt1-K622 give hints on a highly flexible interface. Molecular docking was conducted based on the distance constraints imposed by the cross-links, positioning Sirt1 at the DNA-binding and tetramerization domains of p53. This gives a rationale for a steric exclusion of additional Sirt1 molecules binding to p53. We present the first structural model of the full-length p53:Sirt1 (1:1) complex, establishing a mechanistic framework that links p53 activity to its Sirt1-controlled acetylation status.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> by Zhijian Hu, Yuzhen Wu, Tomas Freire, Erida Gjini, Kevin Wood Drugs play a central role in limiting bacterial population spread, yet laboratory studies typically assume well-mixed environments when assessing microbial drug responses. In contrast, bacteria in the human body often occupy spatially structured habitats where drug concentrations vary. Understanding how this heterogeneity shapes growth and decline is therefore essential for controlling infections and mitigating resistance evolution. Here, we developed a minimal robot-automated system to study how spatial drug heterogeneity affects short-term population dynamics in E. faecalis , a Gram-positive opportunistic pathogen. This system was combined with a theoretical framework to interpret and explain the observed outcomes. We first recapitulated the classic critical-patch-size model result: in a spatially homogeneous environment, a population persists in a finite domain only when growth outpaces diffusive losses at the boundaries. In heterogeneous environments, we found certain conditions that population persistence can depend critically on the spatial arrangement of the drug, even when its total amount is fixed. Using theoretical and experimental approaches, we identified the arrangements that produce the strongest growth and the fastest decline, revealing the range of possible outcomes under drug heterogeneity. We further tested this framework in more complex environments, including ring-shaped communities, and observed consistent arrangement-dependent behavior. Overall, our results extend the classical growth-condition framework to general heterogeneous environments and demonstrate that spatial drug arrangement - not only total dose - can strongly influence bacterial population dynamics. These findings highlight the importance of spatially structured dosing strategies and motivate further theoretical and experimental investigation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> by Ryan Pellow, Josep M. Comeron Eukaryotes’ genomes are organized within nuclei in three-dimensional space, forming structures such as loops, topologically associating domains (TADs), and chromosome territories. This 3D architecture impacts gene regulation and development, stress responses, and disease. However, current methods to infer these 3D structures from genomic data have multiple drawbacks, including varying outcomes depending on the resolution of the analysis and sequencing depth, qualitative outputs that limit statistical comparisons, and insufficient insight into structure frequency within samples. These challenges hinder rigorous comparisons of 3D properties across genomes, conditions, or species. To overcome these issues, we developed WaveTAD, a wavelet transform-based method that provides a resolution-free, probabilistic, and hierarchical description of 3D organization. WaveTAD generates TAD strengths, capturing variable frequency of intrachromosomal interactions within samples, and shows increased accuracy and sensitivity over existing methods. We applied WaveTAD to multiple datasets from Drosophila , mouse, and humans to illustrate new biological insights that our more sensitive and quantitative approach provides, such as the widespread presence of embryonic 3D organization before zygotic genome activation, the effect of multiple CTCF units on the stability of loops and TADs, and the association between gene expression and TAD structures in COVID-19 patients or sex-specific transcription in Drosophila .</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In prophase of meiosis I, the proteinaceous chromosome axis provides a scaffold for the compaction of chromosomes into a linear loop array, controls the formation of interhomolog crossovers, and finally becomes integrated into the synaptonemal complex after crossovers have formed. Despite its fundamental importance, how the proteins of the meiotic chromosome axis - meiotic HORMADs, axis core proteins, and cohesin complexes - self-assemble with one another is incompletely understood. In particular, it remains unknown how cohesin complexes interact with other axis components. Here, we combine genetics in S. cerevisiae, AlphaFold-based protein interaction screens, and biochemical assays to reveal that the S. cerevisiae axis core protein Red1 binds the C-terminal winged helix domain of cohesin&#x27;s meiosis-specific subunit Rec8. We find that this interaction is conserved across fungi and plants, but not in mammals, suggesting that different eukaryotic phyla use distinct protein-protein interfaces to assemble the chromosome axis.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> While Io, the most volcanically active moon in the solar system, appears completely dry and devoid of water ice, its neighbor Europa is thought to harbor a vast global ocean of liquid water beneath its icy crust.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This preprint links sponge silica biomineralization to co-option of an ancestral lysosomal gene toolkit (e.g., VHA-driven vesicle acidification and OCA2/Lsi2-family transport), offering broad evolutionary context for how complex cellular machinery can be repurposed to build mineral structures.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Biomineralization first emerged ~600 million years ago, giving rise to novel strategies for buoyancy, locomotion, and defense. Sponges are the only metazoans that build a silica-based skeleton, and the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying their silicification process are much less understood than in diatoms and land plants, the other two major biosilicifiers. Here, we show that the cells specialized for sponge biosilicification, termed sclerocytes, highly express lysosomal-associated genes, including the V-H+-ATPase (VHA) proton pump, oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2) anion channels, cathepsin-L proteins, silicateins, TMEM55A, TMEM192, TMEM199, and multiple other proteins involved with lysosomal maintenance and degradation. Further, we demonstrate that VHA protein localizes to the sclerocyte silica deposition vesicle (SDV) and that VHA-dependent SDV acidification is essential for silica spicule formation. This function mirrors the localization and role of VHA in diatom biosilicification, while in land plants, acidification occurs extracellularly in the xylem and is driven by a different proton pump, the plasma membrane P-type H+-ATPase. These results indicate that vesicle acidification is a shared mechanism for silica handling in sponges, diatoms, and plants. We also found that genes homologous to the plant silicon efflux transporter Lsi2, which belong to the same gene family as OCA2, are upregulated in sclerocytes. Using Hybridization Chain Reaction Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (HCR-FISH), we found that sponge Lsi2 genes are expressed in sclerocytes, corroborating prior phylogenetic and transcriptomic evidence that Lsi2 homologs are involved in sponge and diatom silicic acid transport. Taking into account previous work showing that VHA, cathepsins, and other lysosomal-associated genes have been associated with calcification across a remarkable range of eukaryotes, including coccolitophores, foraminifera, sea urchins, bryozoans, crustaceans, mollusks, and mammals, we posit that the various biomineralization mechanisms observed throughout the tree of life arose convergently through the co-option of an ancestral lysosomal gene toolkit.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Human mascRNA is a tRNA-like 58-nucleotide non-coding RNA processed from the 3&#x27; end of the MALAT1 transcript. Although implicated in diverse cellular processes, its molecular mechanism has remained unclear. Here, we reveal a direct functional link between mascRNA and the SUMOylation pathway. Structural probing and SEC-SAXS confirm the compact, tRNA-like architecture of mascRNA in solution, while biochemical assays demonstrate its direct interaction with the SUMO E1 activating enzyme in vitro. Proteomic analyses show that mascRNA engages nuclear protein networks enriched for SUMOylated factors, including chromatin remodelers and nucleolar components. Transfection of synthetic mascRNA alters SAE2 and SUMO1 nuclear organization and broadly reduces nuclear SUMOylation, accompanied by decreased ProMyeLocytic (PML) body abundance and SUMO colocalization. SUMO1 immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry reveal widespread decreases in SUMO conjugation, particularly among proteins involved in RNA metabolism and rRNA biogenesis with nuclear body localization. We further validate reduced SUMOylation of nucleolar factors such as BEND3 and ZNF106. These findings position mascRNA as a structured RNA ligand that modulates SUMO-dependent nuclear architecture and protein homeostasis, uncovering an unexpected intersection between RNA biology and post-translational modification networks.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> A biomedical study showing that mitochondrial double-stranded RNA released during renal ischemia-reperfusion activates PKR–ISR signaling to drive ferroptosis, with limited direct relevance to origins-of-life questions beyond general RNA-mediated stress signaling.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Renal ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury remains a leading cause of acute kidney injury, although the precise molecular pathways responsible for tissue injury are not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate that IR initiates ferroptosis through activation of the PKR-dependent integrated stress response (ISR), which is driven by the accumulation of mitochondrial double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Our mechanistic investigations reveal that IR perturbs mitochondrial homeostasis, leading to the accumulation of mitochondrial dsRNA and its subsequent release into the cytosol, thereby activating the dsRNA-dependent kinase PKR. Activation of PKR results in eIF2 phosphorylation and maladaptive ISR signaling, which facilitates ferroptosis and impairs renal function. Notably, genetic ablation of PKR or pharmacological intervention to inhibit ISR significantly reduced ferroptosis and preserved renal function.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Comparative population-genomic analysis of piRNA cluster and transposon dynamics in D. simulans reveals rapid birth–death evolution of small piRNA clusters and species-specific TE drivers, informing eukaryotic RNA-based genome defense rather than core origins-of-life processes.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Eukaryotic genomes are ubiquitously occupied by mobile genetic elements termed transposons, which are silenced via a specialized class of small RNA called piRNA. The small RNA is produced from the transposons themselves when they occupy specialized regions of the genome termed piRNA clusters. The formation of these specialized regions, or their evolution over time, is not well understood. Recent work has suggested that they are extremely variable even within a single species such as Drosophila melanogaster. We were interested in taking a comparative approach to piRNA cluster evolution to ask the question - what processes are unique to D.melanogaster and which are shared? Shared phenomena are more likely to be fundamental aspects of piRNA formation and evolution compared to those that are more labile. Using five high-quality long-read genome assemblies and five genotype-specific piRNA libraries, we approach this question from a population genetics standpoint. We annotate piRNA clusters, transposons, and structural variants in each of these five genomes. We found extensive variation in piRNA clusters across strains, with smaller piRNA clusters more likely to be limited to a single genotype. By and large, our results are consistent with a model of piRNA cluster evolution in which piRNA clusters are rapidly formed and lost, with a small subset increasing in frequency and length over time. However, we find that the TEs which nucleate the formation of small piRNA clusters are entirely distinct in D.simulans compared to D.melanogaster, and likely reflect its invasion history rather than any inherent property of the transposon to nucleate clusters. Therefore, while large common clusters can act as &#x27;traps&#x27; as has been posited for piRNA clusters, there are also numerous small clusters that are born and lost rapidly within a species.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Using extant and resurrected ancestral fungal IMPDH enzymes, the study shows that mycophenolic acid resistance arose alongside a durable catalytic-efficiency loss, implying long-term evolutionary design constraints (and possible pre-existing inhibitor resistance) that can shape the emergence of new metabolic capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The presence of self-resistance genes in antibiotic-producing organisms poses a paradox: how can resistance evolve before the antibiotic exists, and how can an antibiotic producer arise without first evolving resistance? Here we examine the evolutionary origins of self-resistance to mycophenolic acid (MPA), an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). The MPA biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) includes a resistant IMPDH-B. Homologs of IMPDH-B occur not only in MPA producers but also in many non-producing fungi, where remnants of the MPA BGC remain detectable. The phylogeny of IMPDH-B is incongruent with the fungal species tree, consistent with multiple horizontal gene transfer events between Aspergillus and Sordariomycetes. We characterized eleven extant IMPDH-Bs, five from MPA producers and six from nonproducers, along with seven resurrected ancestral enzymes (Anc1-Anc7). MPA resistance appeared between Anc2 and Anc3 and coincided with a loss of catalytic efficiency. Across both ancestral and extant enzymes, MPA resistance correlated strongly with reduced activity, revealing a robust activity-resistance trade-off that has persisted for millions of years. Unexpectedly, both the IMPDH-Bs and ancestral enzymes Anc3-Anc7 were also resistant to ribavirin monophosphate (RVP), an IMP-competitive inhibitor. Because MPA and RVP bind to similar enzyme conformations, the activity-resistance trade-off likely reflects a design constraint imposed by the need to maintain resistance to multiple inhibitors. Intriguingly, although Anc1 and Anc2 are equally sensitive to MPA, Anc2 shows reduced susceptibility to RVP. This pattern suggests that pre-existing resistance to another IMPDH inhibitor may have created a permissive background for the later evolution of MPA biosynthesis.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Shows that engineered complex coacervate droplets can infiltrate and fluidize solid RNA–peptide aggregates back into liquid condensates, offering mechanistic insights relevant to coacervate-based protocell and RNA-world scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Biomolecular condensates are functionally gated by their material properties. While RNA is a primary structural scaffold, its sequence-specific interactions can aberrantly drive condensates into dysfunctional solid aggregates. Yet, actively reversing this solidification to restore function remains a fundamental challenge, impeding progress in synthetic biology and therapeutics interventions. Here, we establish that complex coacervates can be engineered as liquefiers to actively remodel solid RNA-peptide aggregates into functional liquid droplets. Integrating systematic experiments with all-atom simulations, we decode a multiscale mechanism: coacervate infiltration at the micrometer scale mediates molecular buffering at the nanometer scale, which fluidizes the crosslinked network to drive macroscopic liquefaction. This capability is governed by a design rule, where coacervates formed by small-molecular anions exhibit optimal efficacy. We deploy this principle to functionally rescue silenced RNA within a model of pathologically solidified ribonucleoprotein assemblies. Our work provides a general framework for the active, compositional control of biomolecular phase behavior, with direct implications for managing pathological aggregation and engineering functional condensates in synthetic and living systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> DNA replication is both productive and disruptive, synthesising new DNA while dismantling chromatin to allow fork progression. Because of its disruptive nature, DNA replication has been suggested to enable chromatin changes facilitating cell fate transitions. However, the role of DNA replication in cell fate transitions remains incompletely understood. Here we show that upon differentiation of human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) into presomitic mesoderm, DNA replication allows hundreds of proteins, including transcription factors, histone chaperones, and histone methyltransferases, to access chromatin. Moreover, H3K9 methylation is enhanced upon differentiation through a DNA replication-coupled process. Most of the proteins recruited to (or evicted from) nascent chromatin during differentiation are already present in iPSCs, suggesting they may play a role in the early response to differentiation. Among these, we identified ERH and SETDB1 as essential for mesoderm differentiation. Our work reveals a new paradigm to explore: how differentiation signals exploit the replisome interactome to enable rapid chromatin changes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Long before humans became master hunters, our ancestors were already thriving by making the most of what nature left behind. New research suggests that scavenging animal carcasses wasn’t a desperate last resort, but a smart, reliable survival strategy that shaped human evolution. Carrion provided calorie-rich food with far less effort than hunting, especially during hard times, and humans were uniquely suited to take advantage of it—from strong stomach acid and long-distance walking to fire, tools, and teamwork.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Game-theoretic analysis of repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma with frequent strategy innovation, high error rates, and partner choice shows cooperation is stabilized by strategies that punish cheaters by leaving rather than retaliating, offering general evolutionary insight but limited direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Reciprocity is central to explanations of cooperation among unrelated individuals in societies of humans and other animals. Most mathematical analyses of the evolution of reciprocity are based on the repeated Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma (RPD) and typically assume that new strategies are rarely introduced by mutation or analogous cultural processes, that behavioral errors are absent or infrequent, and that agents are bound to interact with the same partner. Here we analyze a version of the RPD in which new strategies are frequently introduced, behavioral errors occur at a substantial rate, and actors may have the option to leave their current partner. In this environment, the usual indeterminacy disappears and the mix of strategies and cooperation levels are quite stable. With the option to leave, cooperation persists at a substantially higher level than without the option to leave. Classical strategies such as Grim, Tit-for-Tat, or Win-Stay-Lose-Shift disappear and are replaced by strategies that sanction cheaters by leaving rather than by retaliatory defection. Beyond a threshold, increasing the number of times partners interact decreases the level of cooperation without the option to leave, but increases it when leaving is possible.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Preprint dissects how MYC-driven transcription amplification is modulated by DNA supercoiling and TOP1 activity via stabilization/mobilization of pre-initiation complexes, offering mechanistic insight into eukaryotic gene regulation but with minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> MYC dysregulation occurs in most cancers provoking, profound changes in gene expression. Although sometimes considered to be an E-box-dependent transcription factor, an alternate model posits MYC to be a universal amplifier of active genes. Although MYC is associated with accelerated pause release, the full extent of its participation in the transcription cycle remains poorly illuminated. MYC also stimulates topoisomerases to resolve topological issues that complicate DNA transactions; whether and how this stimulation is coordinated with or independent of its transcriptional role has not been examined. We have developed a genetic tool that discriminates between MYC&#x27;s ability to activate versus amplify reporter gene expression in any cell. This system enables the interrogation of genes, cofactors, and compounds that execute or modulate MYC activity. Using a combination of biochemical and cellular assays, we reveal the dynamic interplay between MYC-driven transcription amplification and DNA supercoiling. The early stages of transcription are highly sensitive to the level of DNA supercoiling. Reducing the activity of TOP1 either through genetic knockdown or low-dose inhibition potentiates transcription amplification by MYC. This enhancement is associated with pre-initiation complex (PIC) stabilization by DNA supercoiling. MYC helps to mobilize these stabilized PICs.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study shows Arabidopsis La1 binds telomerase RNA and promotes telomerase RNP assembly in a way analogous to ciliate LARP7 pathways, suggesting a conserved evolutionary relationship in eukaryotic RNA biogenesis despite differing protein components.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Arabidopsis thaliana La1 (AtLa1) protein is a member of the genuine La family of RNA biogenesis proteins, which are structurally similar to the La-resembling protein 7 (LARP7) family. LARP7 proteins participate in the biogenesis of the telomerase ribonucleoprotein complex in model systems, but are absent in plants. We show that AtLa1 binds to telomerase RNA in a manner reminiscent of the Tetrahymena LARP7 protein p65. Classical in vitro methods and microscale thermophoresis (MST) were used to specify the molecular structures involved in this multi-surface interaction. AtLa1 also enhances the binding of TR to the telomerase reverse transcriptase RNA binding domain. We therefore propose that biogenesis of telomerase RNA in plants and ciliates is achieved by a similar pathway, differing in the employment of genuine La or LARP7-like proteins, respectively. We also report that the domain of unknown function (DUF3223, DeCL) found in the AtLa1 protein binding partner, Domino, is an RNA binding domain with modest TR-binding capacity. This domain is also found in plant and ciliate proteins, including plant polymerases IV/V and the Tetrahymena La protein Mlp1. Together, these suggest that RNA biogenesis pathways in plants and ciliates have a conserved evolutionary relationship, with parallels between their La proteins.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This bioRxiv preprint reports rational engineering of an alteplase-derived thrombolytic (Brnoteplase) with improved fibrin selectivity, inhibitor resistance, clot penetration, and in vivo safety/efficacy in rat stroke models, but it is not relevant to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> AIMS: Thrombolytic enzymes represent an accessible and streamlined treatment for acute ischemic stroke, yet current FDA-approved agents, alteplase and tenecteplase, are limited by incomplete recanalization, hemorrhagic risk, and neurotoxicity. We aimed to develop a multidisciplinary workflow for rational design and multi-level testing of thrombolytic proteins to generate a next-generation thrombolytic with improved potency and safety. METHODS AND RESULTS: Our pipeline integrated in silico design, biochemical characterization, in vitro thrombolysis, and in vivo validation. Computational screening included rational mutagenesis to reduce side effects, reconstructed ancestral sequences, and database-mined homologs. Selected candidates were biochemically assessed for enzymatic activity, fibrin stimulation, selectivity and affinity, inhibition resistance, and clot penetrability. The most promising variants underwent in vitro clot thrombolysis and in vivo efficacy and safety studies in rats. Brnoteplase emerged as the lead candidate, exhibiting 80-fold enhanced fibrin selectivity, 4-fold higher inhibition resistance, and superior clot penetrability compared to alteplase. In vitro, Brnoteplase demonstrated deeper intrathrombus penetration and a progressive dose-response profile, unlike alteplase, which declined at higher concentrations. In vivo, Brnoteplase achieved higher thrombolysis rates and recanalization frequency across all doses, with extended biological half-life enabling bolus administration. Safety assessments revealed the lowest incidence of severe hemorrhagic transformation and minimal hemispheric asymmetry. CONCLUSIONS: We established a robust pipeline for efficient generation and selection of novel thrombolytics and identified Brnoteplase as a promising candidate combining improved fibrin selectivity, inhibition resistance, biological half-life, and clot penetration. These features translate into higher thrombolytic efficacy and a promising safety profile in vivo, warranting further preclinical evaluation to confirm its potential as a next-generation thrombolytic for acute ischemic stroke.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Corals represent a complex assemblage consisting of a host cnidarian, symbiotic dinoflagellate microalgae, and associated microbiomes and viromes, collectively called the coral holobiont. Corals are foundational to tropical reefs, yet their global decline due to climate change and other stressors creates an uncertain future for this valuable ecosystem. Metabolomics is a powerful means to unravel biochemical interactions within the holobiont that underpin coral resilience and adaptation. However, the remote nature of reefs and the analytical demands of this technique often limit its application. Untargeted metabolomics presents analytical challenges that are amplified in complex samples like corals, such as identifying the biological source of metabolites. Here, we evaluate how different sample fixation methods and time delays before storage, unavoidable in field contexts, affect coral metabolome profiles. We further present a framework for mapping metabolites in holobiont samples to their coral host and algal symbiont origins and introduce a spectral library to improve and automate annotation of coral lipids. Additionally, we demonstrate how single samples can be used concurrently for metabolomics, DNA amplification, and proteomics. Together, our study provides a streamlined, field-adaptable workflow for coral metabolomics that enables larger-scale studies and broader adoption of metabolomics in coral reef research and conservation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Three novel bioluminescent bacterial strains, VNB-15T, VNB-16 and SChm4, were isolated from water of the Black Sea and intestines of the Black Sea horse mackerel. Cells of the isolated strains are motile Gram negative slightly curved rods with single polar flagellum. The temperature range for growth was 10-35{degrees}C, the optimum being 20-25{degrees}C. The pH range for growth was 6.0-9.0, the optimum being 7.0-8.0. The bacteria were able to grow in the presence of 0.5 to 5.0% NaCl (w/v), the optimum being 1.0-4.0% (w/v). Phylogenetic analysis based on comparison of 16S rRNA sequences shows these strains to have kinship with the species Vibrio jasicida, Vibrio hyugaensis, Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio campbelli, Vibrio rotiferianus, Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio owensii with sequence similarity from 99.6 to 98.0%. Phylogenetic analysis based on comparison of the sequences of genes gyrB, recA, pyrH, gapA, rpoA, mreB, ftsZ, topA shows that the strains VNB-15T, VNB-16 and SChm4 to form a cluster within the V. harveyi clade and belong to a new species of the Vibrio genus. Comparison of the complete genomic sequence of VNB-15T with typical strains of nearby species also indicates that VNB-15T belongs to a separate species (maximum similarity 98% with V. hyugaensis and 96% with V. jasicida). VNB-15T differs from closely related species by its ability to utilize glucose, mannitol, inositol, sorbitol, rhamnose and sucrose, and to form lysine decarboxylase, ornithine decarboxylase, lipase, acid phosphatase, -glucosidase, {beta}-glucosidase and N-acetyl-{beta}-D-glucosaminidase enzymes. Based on phylogenetic analysis and phenotypic characteristics, Vibrio aquamarinus sp. nov. is proposed.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Transient transfection is widely used for protein expression in heterologous systems, yet uncontrolled overexpression frequently introduces artifacts that confound functional analyses. Although stable cell lines can mitigate these issues, generating lines for multiple constructs or variants is often impractical. Common alternatives, such as DNA titration, altered transfection conditions, or promoter swapping, provide only coarse and inconsistent control of protein abundance. Here, we establish a panel of ten human 5&#x27; untranslated regions (5&#x27;UTRs) as a modular strategy to tune protein expression during transient transfection. Across three soluble proteins and three membrane proteins, these 5&#x27;UTRs produce a reproducible dynamic range of expression, including fine-grained control of eYFP and the large sensory ion channel TRPA1. Notably, one 5&#x27;UTR consistently suppresses expression across all proteins tested and alleviates overexpression-associated artifacts, improving functional analysis of a hyperactive channel variant, substantially reducing background in proximity biotinylation assays, and enhancing the specificity of a stress granule marker. In contrast, most 5&#x27;UTRs enhance expression of the TRPV1 and TRPM8 sensory receptors, improving protein yield in heterologous systems. Together, this work identifies 5&#x27;UTRs as a compact, versatile, and broadly applicable tool to fine-tune protein abundance, enabling more physiologically relevant and assay-optimized expression in transient transfection experiments.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Back to the 1990&#x27; the single step method developed by Chomczynski and Sacchi for RNA isolation was extended for sequential isolation of RNA, DNA and proteins from a same sample. Although the quality of the extracted RNA turned compatible with RNA-Seq analyses, the extraction of the protein fraction from the same sample was time-consuming and resulting in low yield and quality of proteins not compatible with LC-MS proteomic analyses. Here we report a novel procedure by isolating in parallel the protein fraction and the RNA fraction from the same exact minute mosquito samples. We provide evidence that each cognate fractions are compatible with LC-MS proteomic analysis on the one hand and RNA-Seq analysis on the other hand. This protocol is simple, time efficient and adequate for studies involving limited sample size and could be applied easily to a broad range of animal and human samples.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Reports a human-lineage Alu-associated intronic polyadenylation event producing a truncated, cytoplasmic TAF8 isoform that reshapes TFIID sub-complex assembly, a eukaryotic gene-regulation evolution study with minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite its centrality in regulating RNA polymerase II transcription in all eukaryotes, the TFIID general transcription factor exhibits several layers of variability across different tissues and developmental stages, representing an underexplored hub of evolutionary innovation. Here, we describe a novel short isoform of TAF8 (TAF8s) -- a TFIID scaffold subunit -- which evolved from the use of an intronic polyadenylation site (iPAS) in the human lineage. Comparative genomics analyses show that the emergence of TAF8s expression in the human lineage coincides with minute DNA changes in the iPAS at the edge of a FLAM-C Alu element that inserted into intron 5 in the common ancestor of anthropoid primates (Simiiformes). The human-specific TAF8s isoform lacks nearly half of the canonical CDS, is widely expressed across human tissues, and constitutes a substantial fraction of the TAF8 transcript pool. TAF8s is translated into a truncated protein isoform that lacks the nuclear-localization signal and localises in the cytoplasm. TAF8s interacts with its histone-fold partner TAF10 and other core TFIID subunits, while entirely losing its interactions with TAF2, thus giving rise to alternative TFIID sub-complexes in human cells. Our study suggests that the TFIID complex underwent a recent diversification through a stepwise evolutionary acquisition of complexity in the TAF8 locus in the human lineage, leading to the expression of a novel truncated pan-isoform that might work as a modulator of TFIID assembly. We discuss the ramifications of our findings in TFIID complex diversification, its evolvability, and the genetics of TAF-related congenital disorders.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> O-glycosylation of nucleocytosolic proteins by the Arabidopsis enzymes SPINDLY (SPY; O-fucosyltransferase) and SECRET AGENT (SEC; O-GlcNAc transferase) is essential for plant growth and development, yet the scope of their substrates and regulatory impact remains poorly defined. Here, we combined TurboID-based proximity labeling with quantitative proteomics to systematically map the SPY interactome and determine how SPY- and SEC-dependent modifications influence protein abundance. A functional SPY-TD enriched 221 proxiome proteins, including 80 known O-fucosylated substrates and 141 new interactors. The SPY-TD proxiome is enriched in nuclear pore components, chromatin regulators, transcription factors, and RNA-processing proteins. Integration with O-fucose and O-GlcNAc datasets yielded a comprehensive Arabidopsis SPY/SEC (At-S/S) protein list of 886 candidates. We quantified proteome-wide changes in spy single mutants and inducible spy sec double mutants. Loss of SPY alone caused selective stabilization or destabilization of targets, whereas combined SPY/SEC depletion triggered widespread, synergistic protein abundance changes, particularly affecting nucleoporins, transcriptional regulators, and RNA-binding proteins. Integration with ubiquitination datasets revealed extensive overlap, supporting potential crosstalk between O-fucosylation, O-GlcNAcylation, and ubiquitin-mediated protein turnover. Together, our study establishes proximity labeling as a powerful strategy to define plant O-glycosylation networks and reveals dual, context-dependent roles of SPY and SEC in controlling protein homeostasis and stress-responsive pathways.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Quantum-inspired differential evolution algorithm for high-dimensional Sharpe ratio portfolio optimization, with no substantive connection to origins-of-life or astrobiology beyond generic use of the term “evolution.”</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11029v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: High-dimensional portfolio optimization faces significant computational challenges under complex constraints, with traditional optimization methods struggling to balance convergence speed and global exploration capability. To address this, firstly, we introduce an enhanced Sharpe ratio-based model that incorporates all constraints into the objective function using adaptive penalty terms, transforming the original constrained problem into an unconstrained single-objective formulation. This approach preserves financial interpretability while simplifying algorithmic implementation. To efficiently solve the resulting high-dimensional optimization problem, we propose a Quantum Hybrid Differential Evolution (QHDE) algorithm, which integrates Quantum-inspired probabilistic behavior into the standard DE framework. QHDE employs a Schrodinger-inspired probabilistic mechanism for population evolution, enabling more flexible and diversified solution updates. To further enhance performance, a good point set-chaos reverse learning strategy is adopted to generate a well-dispersed initial population, and a dynamic elite pool combined with Cauchy-Gaussian hybrid perturbations strengthens global exploration and mitigates premature convergence. Experimental validation on CEC benchmarks and real-world portfolios involving 20 to 80 assets demonstrates that QHDE&#x27;s performance improves by up to 73.4%. It attains faster convergence, higher solution precision, and greater robustness than seven state-of-the-art counterparts, thereby confirming its suitability for complex, high-dimensional portfolio optimization and advancing quantum-inspired evolutionary research in computational finance.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11520v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We study joint source-channel coding over Markov channels through the empirical coordination framework. More specifically, we aim at determining the empirical distributions of source and channel symbols that can be induced by a coding scheme. We consider strictly causal encoders that generate channel inputs, without access to the past channel states, henceforth driving the current Markov state evolution. Our main result is the single-letter inner and outer bounds of the set of achievable joint distributions, coordinating all the symbols in the network. To establish the inner bound, we introduce a new notion of typicality, the input-driven Markov typicality, and develop its fundamental properties. Contrary to the classical block-Markov coding schemes that rely on blockwise independence for discrete memoryless channels, our analysis directly exploits the Markov channel structure and improves beyond the independence-based arguments.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11081v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In this paper, we explore the evolution of plane curves and surfaces governed by the hyperbolic mean curvature flow. We propose a mesh-free approach based on the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which eliminates the need for discretization and meshing of computational domains, and is efficient in solving partial differential equations involving high dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on the numerical analysis by employing the PINNs for the hyperbolic geometric evolution equations in the literature. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through several numerical simulations by selecting diverse initial curves and surfaces, as well as both constant and non-constant initial velocities.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11013v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: A continuous route from a disordered soup of simple chemical feedstocks to a functional protocell -- a compartment that metabolizes, grows, and propagates -- remains elusive. Here, we show that a homogeneous aqueous chemical mixture containing phosphorus, iron, molybdenum salts and formaldehyde spontaneously self-organizes into compartments that couple robust non-equilibrium chemical dynamics to their own growth. These structures mature to a sustained, dissipative steady state and support an organic synthetic engine, producing diverse molecular species including many core biomolecular classes. Internal spherules that are themselves growth-competent are produced within the protocells, establishing a rudimentary mode of self-perpetuation. The chemical dynamics we observe in controlled laboratory conditions also occur in reaction mixtures exposed to natural day-night cycles. Strikingly, the morphology and chemical composition of the protocells in our experiments closely resemble molybdenum-rich microspheres recently discovered in current oceanic environments. Our work establishes a robust, testable route to de novo protocell formation. The emergence of life-like spatiotemporal organization and chemical dynamics from minimal initial conditions is more facile than previously thought and could be a recurring natural phenomenon.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11025v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: With 5G deployment and the evolution toward 6G, mobile networks must make decisions in highly dynamic environments under strict latency, energy, and spectrum constraints. Achieving this goal, however, depends on prior knowledge of spatial-temporal variations in wireless channels and traffic demands. This motivates a joint, site-specific representation of radio propagation and user demand that is queryable at low online overhead. In this work, we propose the perception embedding map (PEM), a localized framework that embeds fine-grained channel statistics together with grid-level spatial-temporal traffic patterns over a base station&#x27;s coverage. PEM is built from standard-compliant measurements -- such as measurement report and scheduling/quality-of-service logs -- so it can be deployed and maintained at scale with low cost. Integrated into PEM, this joint knowledge supports enhanced environment-aware optimization across PHY, MAC, and network layers while substantially reducing training overhead and signaling. Compared with existing site-specific channel maps and digital-twin replicas, PEM distinctively emphasizes (i) joint channel-traffic embedding, which is essential for network optimization, and (ii) practical construction using standard measurements, enabling network autonomy while striking a favorable fidelity-cost balance.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This paper develops hazard-based identities and tail bounds for first-hitting times in the Differential Evolution optimization algorithm (L-SHADE), with empirical survival-analysis validation, and has no direct relevance to origins-of-life or astrobiology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11499v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We study first-hitting times in Differential Evolution (DE) through a conditional hazard frame work. Instead of analyzing convergence via Markov-chain transition kernels or drift arguments, we ex press the survival probability of a measurable target set $A$ as a product of conditional first-hit probabilities (hazards) $p_t=\Prob(E_t\mid\mathcal F_{t-1})$. This yields distribution-free identities for survival and explicit tail bounds whenever deterministic lower bounds on the hazard hold on the survival event. For the L-SHADE algorithm with current-to-$p$best/1 mutation, we construct a checkable algorithmic witness event $\mathcal L_t$ under which the conditional hazard admits an explicit lower bound depending only on sampling rules, population size, and crossover statistics. This separates theoretical constants from empirical event frequencies and explains why worst-case constant-hazard bounds are typically conservative. We complement the theory with a Kaplan--Meier survival analysis on the CEC2017 benchmark suite . Across functions and budgets, we identify three distinct empirical regimes: (i) strongly clustered success, where hitting times concentrate in short bursts; (ii) approximately geometric tails, where a constant-hazard model is accurate; and (iii) intractable cases with no observed hits within the evaluation horizon. The results show that while constant-hazard bounds provide valid tail envelopes, the practical behavior of L-SHADE is governed by burst-like transitions rather than homogeneous per-generati on success probabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10765v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Neural networks are commonly trained in highly overparameterized regimes, yet empirical evidence consistently shows that many parameters become redundant during learning. Most existing pruning approaches impose sparsity through explicit intervention, such as importance-based thresholding or regularization penalties, implicitly treating pruning as a centralized decision applied to a trained model. This assumption is misaligned with the decentralized, stochastic, and path-dependent character of gradient-based training. We propose an evolutionary perspective on pruning: parameter groups (neurons, filters, heads) are modeled as populations whose influence evolves continuously under selection pressure. Under this view, pruning corresponds to population extinction: components with persistently low fitness gradually lose influence and can be removed without discrete pruning schedules and without requiring equilibrium computation. We formalize neural pruning as an evolutionary process over population masses, derive selection dynamics governing mass evolution, and connect fitness to local learning signals. We validate the framework on MNIST using a population-scaled MLP (784--512--256--10) with 768 prunable neuron populations. All dynamics reach dense baselines near 98\% test accuracy. We benchmark post-training hard pruning at target sparsity levels (35--50\%): pruning 35\% yields $\approx$95.5\% test accuracy, while pruning 50\% yields $\approx$88.3--88.6\%, depending on the dynamic. These results demonstrate that evolutionary selection produces a measurable accuracy--sparsity tradeoff without explicit pruning schedules during training.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11501v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: To make DNA a suitable medium for archival data storage, it is essential to consider the decay process of the strands observed in DNA storage systems. This paper studies the decay process as a probabilistic noisy torn paper channel (TPC), which first corrupts the bits of the transmitted sequence in a probabilistic manner by substitutions, then breaks the sequence into a set of noisy unordered substrings. The present work devises coding schemes for the noisy TPC by embedding markers in the transmitted sequence. We investigate the use of static markers and markers connected to the data in the form of hash functions. These two tools have also been recently exploited to tackle the noiseless TPC. Simulations show that static markers excel at higher substitution probabilities, while data-dependent markers are superior at lower noise levels. Both approaches achieve reconstruction rates exceeding $99\%$ with no false decodings observed, primarily limited by computational resources.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10811v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We investigate the long-term impact of disc photoevaporation on the dynamical stability and evolution of giant planet pairs in mean motion resonances. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with FARGO3D, in which we have included mass-loss due to photoevaporation, we explore a parameter space covering disc mass, viscosity, planet mass, and resonance type. We find that strong photoevaporation depletes gas in the common gap between the planets, slowing migration and suppressing planet-disc interactions that typically lead to resonance breaking and eccentricity damping. This stabilising effect is most significant for 3:2 resonances, which are more prone to disruption due to the reduced planet spacing. In contrast, 2:1 resonances are generally more robust but can still be destabilised at high disc mass and moderate-to-strong photoevaporation due to asymmetric torques. Photoevaporation can therefore stabilise resonances that would otherwise break, or conversely disrupt resonances that are natively more stable. Even in cases where photoevaporation does not directly affect resonance stability, it typically results in increased planetary eccentricities. These results highlight the complex, system-dependent nature of resonance evolution, with implications for the final orbital architectures of giant planet systems and their detectability via astrometry from missions such as Gaia.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10794v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Characterizing exoplanet host stars at a population level requires a method of homogeneously characterizing stellar properties across all spectral types. To this end, we have developed Metal Pipe, a new code for determining stellar parameters and abundances, which is designed for use across a wider range of spectral types than many commonly used codes. It combines the widely-used package MOOG with photometric stellar parameters, a user-supplied high-resolution spectrum, and a newly curated list of spectral lines. Metal Pipe outputs values for $T_{\rm{eff}}$, $\log{(g)}$, $M_*$, $R_*$, and $L_*$ from isochrones, and abundances of C, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, S, Ca, Ti, and Fe from MOOG. In this paper, we describe the Metal Pipe algorithm and tests of Metal Pipe against previous abundance measurements on archival HIRES spectra of 503 F, G, and K type stars. We find RMS scatters of ~100 K in $T_{\rm{eff}}$, ~0.10 dex in $\log{(g)}$, and ~0.10 dex for all measured abundances. These values are comparable to estimated measurement uncertainties, verifying Metal Pipe for continued use in building a detailed abundance catalog. Future papers in this series will test Metal Pipe&#x27;s applicability to late K and M dwarf stars, and provide other improvements.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2505.15806v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We report the discovery of a dwarf planet candidate, 2017 OF201, currently located at a distance of 90 au. Its orbit is extremely wide and extends to the inner Oort cloud, with a semi-major axis of 830 au and a perihelion of 45 au, precisely determined from 24 observations over 20 years. Assuming a typical albedo of 0.13, we estimate a diameter about 700 km, making it the second-largest known object in this dynamical population and a dwarf planet candidate with the widest orbit. Its high eccentricity suggests that an unseen population of similar objects would total about 1% of Earth&#x27;s mass.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11280v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Cold Jupiters play a crucial role in planet formation and dynamical evolution. Since their initial discovery around 47 UMa, they have attracted significant interest, yet their formation mechanisms remain uncertain, underscoring the need to expand the known population. In this work, we combine RV data with Gaia astrometry using Hipparcos-Gaia proper-motion anomalies over a 25-year baseline. By jointly modeling both datasets with the MCMC framework, we constrain planetary masses, orbital inclinations, and three-dimensional orbital architectures. This reduces RV degeneracies and improves mass determinations. Four cold Jupiters are reported: HD 68475 b and HD 100508 b are each the first confirmed planet in their systems, with orbital periods $7832_{-323}^{+463}$ d and $5681\pm42$ d and dynamical masses of $5.16_{-0.47}^{+0.53} M_{\text{Jup}}$ and $1.2_{-0.18}^{+0.30} M_{\text{Jup}}$, respectively. In multi-planet systems, HD 48265 c has a period of $10418_{-1400}^{+2400}$ d and a mass of $3.71_{-0.43}^{+0.68} M_{\text{Jup}}$, while HD 114386 c orbits at $444.00_{-0.88}^{+0.93}$ d with a minimum mass of $0.37 \pm 0.03 M_{\text{Jup}}$. The two planets in the HD 48265 system may exhibit a significant mutual inclination, making it a target for testing the von-Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov mechanism. HD 68475 b is a promising candidate for future direct imaging with ELT/METIS. We identified a Jupiter analog with the longest known orbital period among planets with masses between 0.5 and 2 $M_{\text{Jup}}$, implying that a substantial population of cold Jupiters likely awaits discovery by Gaia. This study expands the sample of cold Jupiters with constrained orbits and dynamical masses, demonstrating the value of combining radial velocity and astrometry in exoplanet research.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2510.09841v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Planned and future missions, including the Habitable Worlds Observatory, will aim to image Earth-like exoplanets around Sun-like stars in reflected light. Determining whether an exoplanet is in the habitable zone of its star may be difficult in multi-planet systems when the observer does not know in advance which detection corresponds to which planet. This &quot;confusion&quot; problem will be a concern for future missions due to the high occurrence rate of multi-planet systems, and will be exacerbated by lack of prior knowledge about planets&#x27; orbital parameters or characteristics. We address the planet-detection confusion problem by developing a photometry model and new orbit ranking scheme to augment a &quot;deconfuser&quot; tool and account for phase variation exhibited by planets throughout their orbits. We demonstrate the new ranking scheme as a proof-of-concept on a subset of highly confused simulated multi-planet systems among three inclination groupings (low, medium, and high). We find that incorporating photometry improves differentiation of previously confused orbits in more than half of these particularly challenging cases. These results emphasize that photometry is useful for orbit discrimination and deconfusion of directly imaged multi-planet systems, and should be considered when fitting orbits to detections.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2510.08691v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Direct observations of exoplanet and brown dwarf companions with near-infrared interferometry, first enabled by the dual-field mode of VLTI/GRAVITY, provide unique measurements of the objects&#x27; orbital motions and atmospheric compositions. Here, we compile a homogeneous library of all exoplanet and brown dwarf K-band spectra observed by GRAVITY thus far. We re-reduced all the available GRAVITY dual-field high-contrast data and, where companions are detected, extract their ~2.0-2.4 $\mu$m K-band contrast spectra. We then derived stellar model atmospheres for all employed flux references, which we used to convert the companion contrast into companion flux spectra. Solely from the resulting GRAVITY spectra, we extracted spectral types, spectral indices, and bulk physical properties for all companions. Finally, and with the help of age constraints from the literature, we also derived isochronal masses for most companions using evolutionary models. The resulting library contains R ~ 500 GRAVITY spectra of 39 substellar companions from late M to late T spectral types, including the entire L-T transition. Throughout this transition, a shift from CO-dominated late M- and L-type dwarfs to CH4-dominated T-type dwarfs can be observed in the K-band. The GRAVITY spectra alone constrain the objects&#x27; bolometric luminosity to typically within $\pm$0.15 dex. The derived isochronal masses agree with dynamical masses from the literature where available, except for HD 4113 c for which we confirm its previously reported potential underluminosity. Medium-resolution spectroscopy of substellar companions with GRAVITY provides insight into the carbon chemistry and the cloudiness of these objects&#x27; atmospheres. It also constrains these objects&#x27; bolometric luminosities which can yield measurements of their formation entropy if combined with dynamical masses, for instance from Gaia and GRAVITY astrometry.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11069v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: TP53 is the most frequently mutated tumor suppressor gene in human cancers, with mutations primarily in its DNA-binding domain (p53-DBD). Mutations in p53-DBD are categorized into hotspot mutations (resulting in complete loss-of-function) and non-hotspot mutations (inducing partial loss-of-function). However, the allosteric mechanisms underlying non-hotspot mutations remain elusive. Using p53 dimer as models, we constructed p53-WT, non-hotspot p53-E180R, and hotspot p53-R248W dimer-DNA complexes to compare the structural and functional impacts of these two mutation types. Our results reveal that both mutations weaken intramolecular interactions in p53-DBD and enhance structural flexibility. Specifically, E180R perturbs dimer interface interactions, impairing dimer stability and cooperative DNA binding; R248W disrupts interactions between the L3/L1 loops and DNA, leading to the loss of DNA-binding capacity. Steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations further confirm that both mutations accelerate p53 dimer dissociation, with E180R exerting the most prominent disruptive effect on the mechanical stability of the dimer interface.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Develops a detailed diffraction/interference framework for central flashes in stellar occultations to better interpret remote-sensing constraints on Solar System atmospheres (e.g., Pluto/Triton), but with minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11380v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Central flashes occur during stellar occultations by solar system objects. We catalog diffraction effects on the flash with point-like stars, monochromatic waves and spherical transparent atmosphere. Diffraction involves the Huygens principle, the Sommerfeld lemma and the stationary phase method, while finite stellar diameter cases involve Clausius&#x27; theorem. For point-like stars, the central flash shape is that of the classical Poisson spot, but with larger height. For tenuous atmospheres that cannot focus the stellar rays at shadow center, the flash is amplified by the factor (R_0/r_0)^2 compared to the Poisson spot, where R0 and r0 are the object and the shadow radii, respectively. For denser atmospheres that can focus the rays at shadow center, the flash peaks at 2[(pi*R/lambda_F})^2]*phi0, where R is the central flash layer radius, lambda_F is the Fresnel scale and phi0 is the flux that would be observed at shadow center without focusing. For isothermal atmospheres with scale height H, the height is 2(R*H)(pi/lambda_F)^2. Fringes surrounding the central flash are separated by lambda_P=lambda_F^2/R, related to the separation between the primary and secondary stellar images. For a projected stellar diameter D*&gt;lambda_P, the flash is described by complete elliptic integrals, and has full width at half maximum of 1.14D* and peak value 8H/D*. For Earth-based occultations by Pluto and Triton observed in the visible with point-like stars, diffraction causes flashes with very large heights ~10e4-10e5, spread over a very small meter-sized region in the shadow plane. In practice, the flash is usually smoothed by the stellar diameter, but still reaches high values of ~50 and ~200 during Pluto and Triton occultations, respectively. Diffraction dominates when using millimeter wavelengths or longer. Effects of departure from sphericity, atmospheric waves and stellar limb darkening are discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.22354v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The Solar Wind ANisotropies (SWAN) all-sky hydrogen Lyman-alpha camera on the Solar and Heliosphere Observatory (SOHO) observed the hydrogen coma of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, also called C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), beginning on November 6, 2025, 9 days after perihelion. Water production rates were calculated from each image of 3I/ATLAS using the methodology of Makinen &amp; Combi (2005, Icarus 177, 217) and fluorescence rates, g-factors, calculated using the daily solar Lyman-alpha fluxes from the LASP database (https://lasp.colorado.edu/lisird/data) corrected for solar rotation and for the comet heliocentric velocity. The method has been used for over 90 comet apparitions (Combi 2022; Combi et al. 2019). A water production rate of 3.17 x 10^29 s^-1 was found on November 6 when the comet was at a heliocentric distance of 1.40 au and at a sufficient solar elongation angle. It decreased over time after that, down to 1-2 x 10^28 s^-1 around 40 days post-perihelion (December 9).</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.20581v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The function of RNA molecules is deeply related to their secondary structure, which determines which nucleobases are accessible for pairing. Most RNA molecules however function through dynamic and heterogeneous structural ensembles. Chemical probing methods (e.g., DMS probing) rely on selective chemical modification of accessible RNA nucleotides to infer base-pairing status, yet the resulting nucleotide-resolution data represent ensemble averages over dynamic RNA conformations. We present MERGE-RNA, a unified, physics-based framework that explicitly models the full experimental pipeline, from the thermodynamics of probe binding to the mutational profiling readout. By integrating measurements across probe concentrations and replicates, our model learns a small set of transferable and interpretable parameters together with minimal sequence-specific soft constraints. This enables the prediction of secondary structure ensembles that best explain the data and the detection of suboptmal structures involved in dynamic processes. We validate MERGE-RNA on diverse RNAs, showing that it achieves strong structural accuracy while preserving essential conformational heterogeneity. In a designed RNA for which we report new DMS data, MERGE-RNA detects transient intermediate states associated with strand displacement, dynamics that remain invisible to traditional methods.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11013v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: A continuous route from a disordered soup of simple chemical feedstocks to a functional protocell -- a compartment that metabolizes, grows, and propagates -- remains elusive. Here, we show that a homogeneous aqueous chemical mixture containing phosphorus, iron, molybdenum salts and formaldehyde spontaneously self-organizes into compartments that couple robust non-equilibrium chemical dynamics to their own growth. These structures mature to a sustained, dissipative steady state and support an organic synthetic engine, producing diverse molecular species including many core biomolecular classes.

Strikingly, the morphology and chemical composition of the protocells in our experiments closely resemble molybdenum-rich microspheres recently discovered in current oceanic environments. Our work establishes a robust, testable route to de novo protocell formation. The emergence of life-like spatiotemporal organization and chemical dynamics from minimal initial conditions is more facile than previously thought and could be a recurring natural phenomenon.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11469v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We present observations and analysis of the bound planetary microlensing event KMT-2025-BLG-1616. The planetary signal was captured by the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) and the DECam Rogue Earths and Mars Survey (DREAMS). DREAMS&#x27;s minute-cadence observations break the central/resonant degeneracy in the binary-lens models. The color of the faint source star ($I=22$) is measured from the DREAMS&#x27;s $r - z$ color. The planetary system has a planet-host mass ratio of $q \sim 5 \times 10^{-4}$. A Bayesian analysis yields a host-star mass of $\sim 0.3\,M_\odot$, a planetary mass of $\sim 40\,M_{\oplus}$, a projected planet-host separation of $\sim 1.6~\mathrm{au}$, and a lens distance of $\sim 7.5~\mathrm{kpc}$. Based on the photometric precision achieved by DREAMS for this event, we simulate free-floating planet (FFP) detections and find that DREAMS is sensitive to Mars-mass FFPs in the Galactic bulge and Moon-mass FFPs in the Galactic disk.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10763v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: A probabilistic formulation of irreversible kinetics is introduced in which incrementally admissible histories are weighted by a Gibbs-type measure built from an energy-dissipation action and observation constraints, with Theta controlling epistemic uncertainty. This measure can be interpreted as a Bayesian posterior over histories. In the zero-uncertainty limit, it concentrates on maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) histories, recovering classical deterministic evolution by incremental minimization in the convex generalized-standard-material setting, while allowing multiple competing MAP histories for non-convex energies or temporally coupled constraints. This emergence is demonstrated across seven distinct forward-in-time examples and an inverse inference problem of unknown histories from sparse observations via a global constrained minimum-action principle.</p>

This a priori spin-forbidden transition triggered numerous time-resolved experiments of solvated samples to elucidate the mechanism at play. The involved intermediate states remain uncertain. We apply ultrafast x-ray spectroscopy in molecular films as a method sensitive to spin, electronic, and nuclear degrees of freedom. Combining the progress in molecule synthesis and film growth with the opportunities at x-ray free-electron lasers, we analyze the transient evolution of the Fe L3 fine structure at room temperature. Our measurements and calculations indicate the involvement of an Fe triplet intermediate state. The high-spin state saturates at half of the available molecules, limited by molecule-molecule interaction within the film.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10776v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We study a variety of stochastic contact processes -- directly related to models of rumor and disease spreading -- from the viewpoint of their constants of motion, either exact or approximated. Much as in deterministic systems, constants of motion in stochastic dynamics make it possible to reduce the number of relevant variables, confining the set of accessible states, and thus facilitating their analytical treatment. For processes of rumor propagation based on the Maki-Thompson model, we show how to construct exact constants of motion as linear combinations of conserved quantities in each elementary contact event, and how they relate to the constants of motion of the corresponding mean-field equations, which are obtained as the continuous-time, large-size limit of the stochastic process. For SIR epidemic models, both in homogeneous systems and on heterogeneous networks, we find that a similar procedure produces approximate constants of motion, whose average value is preserved along the evolution. We also give examples of exact and approximate constants of motion built as nonlinear combinations of the relevant variables, whose expressions are suggested by their mean-field counterparts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.17971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: We propose physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) as a numerical solver for relativistic spin hydrodynamics and demonstrate that the total angular momentum, i.e., the sum of orbital and spin angular momentum, is accurately conserved throughout the fluid evolution by imposing the conservation law directly in the loss function as a training target. This enables controlled numerical studies of the mutual conversion between spin and orbital angular momentum, a central feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics driven by the rotational viscous effect. We present two physical scenarios with a rotating fluid confined in a cylindrical container: one case in which initial orbital angular momentum is converted into spin angular momentum in analogy with the Barnett effect, and the opposite case in which initial spin angular momentum is converted into orbital angular momentum in analogy with the Einstein-de Haas effect. We investigate these conversion processes governed by the rotational viscous effect by analyzing the spacetime profiles of thermal vorticity and spin potential. Our PINNs-based framework provides the first numerical evidence for spin-orbit angular momentum conversion with fully nonlinear computational relativistic spin hydrodynamics.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2505.04823v4 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Sequence generative models are transforming protein engineering. However, no principled framework exists for conditioning these models on auxiliary information, such as experimental data, without additional training of a generative model. Herein, we present ProteinGuide, a method for such &quot;on-the-fly&quot; conditioning, amenable to a broad class of protein generative models including Masked Language Models (e.g. ESM3), any-order auto-regressive models (e.g. ProteinMPNN) as well as diffusion and flow matching models (e.g. MultiFlow). ProteinGuide stems from our unifying view of these model classes under a single statistical framework. As proof of principle, we perform several in silico experiments. We first guide pre-trained generative models to design proteins with user-specified properties, such as higher stability or activity. Next, we design for optimizing two desired properties that are in tension with each other. Finally, we apply our method in the wet lab, using ProteinGuide to increase the editing activity of an adenine base editor in vivo with data from only a single pooled library of 2,000 variants. We find that a single round of ProteinGuide achieves a higher editing efficiency than was previously achieved using seven rounds of directed evolution.</p>

Strikingly, the morphology and chemical composition of the protocells in our experiments closely resemble molybdenum-rich microspheres recently discovered in current oceanic environments. Our work establishes a robust, testable route to de novo protocell formation. The emergence of life-like spatiotemporal organization and chemical dynamics from minimal initial conditions is more facile than previously thought and could be a recurring natural phenomenon.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.11391v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We present NAVIS (NAnochannel Velocity and thermal Interfacial Slip), a LAMMPS-Python scripted toolkit for computing the Navier (hydrodynamic) friction coefficient and Kapitza (thermal) resistance at arbitrary solid-fluid interfaces. NAVIS is based on equilibrium molecular dynamics (EMD) methods for calculating the linear response friction and thermal resistance at the interface, as well as the corresponding velocity and temperature slips. The methodology is based on our previous studies (Hansen, et al., Phys. Rev. E 84, 016313 (2011); Varghese et al., J. Chem. Phys. 154, 184707 (2021); Alosious, et al., J. Chem. Phys. 151, 194502 (2019); Alosious, et al., Langmuir 37, 2355-2361 (2021)), and in this work we provide a pedagogical framework for the implementation of this toolkit on two systems: (i) a water-graphene system (for hydrodynamic slip) and (ii) a water-CNT system (for thermal slip). We provide detailed instructions for performing the EMD simulations using the LAMMPS package and processing the simulation outputs using Python modules to obtain the desired quantities of interest. We expect the toolkit to be useful for computational researchers studying interfacial friction and thermal transport, key factors for efficient and practical applications of nanofluidic systems.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> A plant developmental genetics review on rhizome regulation and evolution, with minimal relevance to origins-of-life or astrobiology beyond a general evolutionary context.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10847v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Rhizomes play fundamental roles in plant evolution, persistence, and environmental adaptation by enabling clonal propagation, resource storage, and stress resilience. Despite their ecological and agronomic importance across diverse plant lineages, the genetic and developmental regulation of rhizomes remains poorly characterized. Here, we synthesize findings from in vitro induction studies, in vivo physiological and developmental analyses, quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, comparative transcriptomics, and limited functional studies to evaluate current knowledge and highlight outstanding questions in rhizome biology. Results show that phytohormones are central regulators of rhizome initiation and growth, with effects mediated in a context-dependent manner through interactions with environmental and developmental cues. Across rhizomatous species, traits such as rhizome initiation, branching, and elongation are typically under polygenic control, although comparatively simpler genetic architectures have been documented in emerging model systems like Mimulus. Transcriptomic analyses further highlight hormone signaling, stress-response, and carbohydrate metabolism pathways as key regulatory components. However, few genes have been functionally validated, underscoring the need for experimentally tractable systems for genetic dissection. Perennial Mimulus species are proposed as promising models for rhizome research due to their experimental accessibility, ecological relevance, and established genomic resources. Integrated approaches leveraging fine-mapping, near-isogenic lines, multi-omics network reconstruction, and genome editing are poised to accelerate the discovery of causal loci and regulatory networks underlying rhizome development, thereby illuminating key processes involved in plant adaptation and perenniality, with direct implications for evolutionary biology and crop improvement.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chemically modified nucleic acids have become a powerful platform for basic research and applied technologies. Universal nucleobases are used in PCR,sequencing, and the design of nanodevices and aptamers. Fluorescent universal nucleobases have an even wider range of applications, including the development of nucleic acid-based sensors, switches, and relay logic gates. However, few such nucleobases have been proposed to date, and most of them have suboptimal optical properties. Here, we propose an adenine-based molecular rotor, 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-6-(3-methylbenzo[d]thiazol-2(3H)-ylidene)adenine (oxo-AdeBZT), as a new, remarkably bright and potent fluorescent universal nucleobase. Its brightness in both oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ODNs) and DNA duplexes (4200 - 10000 M-1 * cm-1) originates from a high molar extinction coefficient (averaged 37000 M-1 * cm-1), provided by the appended 3-methylbenzo[d]thiazolyl moiety, and a relatively high quantum yield (0.11 - 0.27). Melting temperature variations observed upon the incorporation of oxo-AdeBZT opposite native nucleobases in a duplex context did not exceed 10%. The basis of these universal hybridizing properties was unveiled using computational methods. According to molecular dynamics simulations, oxo-AdeBZT pushes the opposite nucleobase out of the DNA double helix and forms multiple hydrophobic contacts with the flanking base pairs. At the same time, the rotational mobility of the bonds between the oxo-AdeBZT-constituting heterobicycles decreases, and oxo-AdeBZT adopts a planar conformation in both ODNs and their duplexes, resulting in the light-up effect. These properties make oxo-AdeBZT a promising molecular tool for analytical, biophysical and biochemical studies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> RNA molecules play critical roles in biology and therapeutics, with their function intimately tied to their secondary structure. Designing RNA sequences that reliably fold into desired secondary structures, especially those with complex pseudoknots, remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we present Struct2SeQ, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages deep Q-learning to generate RNA sequences conditioned on target secondary structures and SHAPE reactivity constraints. By formulating RNA design as a sequential decision-making process, our model learns to construct sequences that not only fold into the intended structures but also exhibit experimentally consistent SHAPE profiles. Evaluated with experimental data from the OpenKnot 240mer pseudoknot design challenges, Struct2SeQ significantly outperformed humans and other automated design methods while generating diverse solutions that explore a broader sequence space compared to human players. The incorporation of SHAPE-informed rewards further enhances the chemical validity of generated sequences, as evidenced by improved OpenKnot scores. Our results demonstrate the potential of reinforcement learning for RNA design tasks, opening avenues for engineering RNAs with complex structures and functions</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The surface of gram-positive bacteria is a highly regulated environment with specific attachment of proteins required for viability. Sortase enzymes are cysteine transpeptidases that recognize and ligate substrates to the peptidoglycan layer in these microorganisms, which can be highly pathogenic (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, etc.). As such, sortases represent a potentially novel target for antibiotic development. In addition, the catalytic activity of sortase enzymes is utilized in sortase mediated ligation (SML) engineering approaches for a variety of uses. In SML experiments, engineered variants of Staphylococcus aureus sortase A (saSrtA) are the most widely used enzymes. One of the mutated amino acids in the previously engineered pentamutant (or saSrtA5M) enzyme is P94. Structural analyses of experimental saSrtA structures revealed that P94 interacts directly with Y187 when saSrtA is in its inactive conformation. While saSrtA5M, developed via directed evolution, contains a P94R mutation, we wanted to interrogate this position further and ask if other single P94 mutations may reveal a greater effect on activity and/or substrate specificity. We created 18 P94X mutations (excluding P94C), and tested relative activity using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay for 4 substrate sequences: LPATG, LPETG, LPKTG, and LPSTG. We identified several P94 variants that outperformed the single mutant P94R for all peptides tested, including P94A, P94D, P94E, P94G, P94H, P94N, P94Q, P94S, and P94T. We further observed that the reactivity of substrates with variations in the central position of the pentapeptide recognition motif (LPXTG) can be sensitive to the identity of the P94X residue. We tested P94A and P94D saSrtA5M variants and found that, depending on LPXTG sequence, these variants could outperform saSrtA5M in activity &gt; 3-fold. Finally, we compared saSrtA5M and P94D saSrtA5M in a model sortase-mediated ligation reaction using a LPKTG substrate and saw ~2-fold greater product formation. Taken together, we characterized an important position that modulates substrate access and activity in saSrtA. Furthermore, we argue that future studies which combine rational design and high throughput approaches, e.g., directed evolution, may result in sortase variants with increased SML potential.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> DNA sliding clamps are used by the replication machines of all organisms, from bacteria to human. These clamps do not self-assemble onto DNA but require a multiprotein ATPase clamp loader that recognizes a DNA 3&#x27;-recessed end to open and close sliding clamps onto it. We find here that the mechanism of clamp loading onto small ssDNA gaps is profoundly different between bacteria and eukaryotes. The eukaryotic RFC clamp loader unwinds dsDNA from the 3&#x27;-recessed end to widen the ssDNA gap and also binds the 5&#x27;-recessed DNA end at an external shoulder site. In contrast, the bacterial DnaX-complex neither unwinds DNA nor stably binds DNA at the shoulder site in vitro. Instead, the bacterial {beta}-clamp has evolved an external DNA binding site that enables the DnaX-complex to sharply bend a gapped DNA by 150{degrees} to insert it into the clamp. Small DNA gaps are frequently associated with DNA damage, and the clamps loaded at these sites likely function in DNA repair.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study identifies a new cytoplasmic role for the eukaryotic N-terminal methyltransferase NRMT1 in modulating early translation and ER-associated targeting, but it is largely modern cell biology with limited direct relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> N-terminal methylation of proteins by the trimethylase NRMT1 plays important roles in oncogenesis, development, and aging. As N-terminal methylation has frequently been shown to regulate protein-DNA interactions, and many NRMT1 substrates are transcription factors or regulators of chromatin structure, previous research has focused on how transcriptional regulation by NRMT1 affects cell growth and differentiation. However, we have recently identified a new, cytoplasmic role for NRMT1, inhibiting the eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (eEF1A) methyltransferase METTL13, which indicates NRMT1 could also be acting as a translational regulator. Here we further explore NRMT1 cytoplasmic functions and show that, unlike previously thought, NRMT1 can methylate substrates in the cytoplasm. We also show that while many of these substrates remain bound to NRMT1, it can also interact with a number of non-target ribosomal proteins and proteins associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To confirm NRMT1 interaction with the ribosome, we performed polysome profiling, which showed a portion of NRMT1 co-migrates with the 40S and 60S subunits but not with actively translating polysomes, indicating NRMT1 may play an early role in translation. To see if NRMT1 was affecting target mRNA selection of ribosomes, we also performed ribosome-sequencing experiments in proliferating and differentiating C2C12 mouse myoblasts. These results show a striking upregulation of translation of soluble proteins with NRMT1 loss and corresponding decrease in translation of transmembrane and signal sequence-containing proteins. We now propose a model where NRMT1 regulates the translation of transmembrane and secreted proteins by facilitating interactions between the ribosome and the ER.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, catalyzed by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs), is a key post-transcriptional modification that regulates RNA splicing, stability, and translation. Dysregulation of ADAR activity caused by mutations in ADAR1 leads to Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS), an autoimmune disorder characterized by aberrant activation of Melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) by self RNA and excessive type I interferon production. Despite its biological and clinical relevance, the regulation of ADAR1 activity remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that ADAR1 protein levels and RNA editing activity in mammalian cells critically depend on the cofactor inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6). Using Inositol-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPPK)-knockout cells, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and a cell-permeable IP6 prodrug (Pro-IP6), we demonstrate that IP6 depletion drastically reduces global RNA editing, while supplementation with Pro-IP6 restores and even enhances editing levels. In vitro ADAR1 translation and RNA editing assays revealed that IP6 contributes to the folding and full catalytic activity of ADAR1, and that inositol pentakisphosphate (1,3,4,5,6-IP5) can partially substitute IP6 as a cofactor. Molecular dynamics simulations and biochemical analyses identified the C6-phosphate of IP6 as a critical determinant of ADAR1 catalytic efficiency, functioning within a hydrogen-bonding network that indirectly governs Zn2+-ion positioning through interactions with key residues, including K1039 and N907. Notably, the AGS-associated N907S mutation impairs RNA editing, by altering IP6 coordination and introducing a more dynamic situation in the hydrogen-bonding network that linked IP6 and Zn2+-ion.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Storage of biological materials is essential for medical, research, and biotechnological applications. While cold-chain preservation is effective, it is costly, infrastructure-dependent, and vulnerable to disruption. Room-temperature dry storage, inspired by desiccation-tolerant organisms, provides an alternative by stabilizing biomolecules in vitrified (glass-like) matrices that limit molecular motion which if not reduced can lead to breakdown and loss of integrity. Trehalose is widely used as a vitrifying agent, but its protective capacity depends on glassy properties shaped by drying methods, environmental conditions, storage duration, and the type of preserved molecule. Systematic studies linking these factors to short and long-term stability remain limited. Here, we examine how drying conditions and storage duration influence the stability of DNA, RNA, and enzymes in vitrified trehalose systems. DNA remained stable under all conditions, independent of trehalose or drying parameters, reflecting its intrinsic resistance to desiccation-induced damage. RNA showed moderate sensitivity to drying without trehalose but was stabilized in its presence, although RNA integrity did not consistently correlate with measured vitrified properties. In contrast, enzymes were highly sensitive to drying without trehalose and were strongly protected under conditions that promoted favorable vitrified properties. Enzyme protection after 30 minutes correlated with high glass transition temperature. However, during prolonged drying, increased glass transition temperature was inversely correlated with enzyme protection and was a better indicator of detrimental physical aging of the vitrified system. These findings present the first insight into how drying methods, environmental conditions, and storage duration shape vitrified properties and stability. They guide optimization of room-temperature preservation.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study dissects how the eukaryotic Integrator subunit INTS12 modulates NELF–RNAPII pausing to prevent release of defective transcription complexes, a mechanistic advance in transcription regulation but with minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Promoter-proximal RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) pausing and the processivity are controlled by distinct modules of the Integrator complex, which together fine-tune transcription and protect against the accumulation of defective RNAPII complexes. Compromised activity of individual Integrator modules has been linked to human disease including cancer and developmental disorders, caused by defective transcription of protein-coding or small-nuclear RNAs. Despite extensive characterisation of the Integrator complex both genetically and structurally, the role of smallest member of the complex, INTS12, has remained enigmatic. Here, we uncover that INTS12 loss acts to stabilise the association between NELF and Integrator via its PHD domain and N-terminus, respectively, thus safeguarding against the release of defective RNAPII complexes. Acute degradation of INTS12 results in the selective dissociation of Integrator from the NELF-RNAPII complex which subsequently convert to their canonical paused form from which they can be released by CDK9. In the absence of INTS12 excess release of defective RNAPII via P-TEFb/SEC, loss of the ARMC5 salvage pathway and deletion of the catalytic and core Integrator subunits is toxic to cells. These findings demonstrate that there is interconversion between canonical paused RNAPII and paused-Integrator, and highlight the critical interplay between these processes and P-TEFb mediated pause-release to ensure that only transcription competent complexes are released into elongation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> dUTPase is universally regarded as a metabolic sanitizing enzyme that protects genomes by preventing the incorporation of uracil into DNA. Despite its essentiality across eukaryotes, no function beyond nucleotide sanitization has been demonstrated. Here, we uncover a conserved, non-canonical role for dUTPase as a regulator of mitosis. Using Drosophila and mouse models, we demonstrate that dUTPase loss causes early embryonic lethality characterized by severe mitotic failure that, cannot be rescued by disabling uracil-DNA repair, uncoupling dUTPase essentiality from DNA repair pathways. Mechanistically, dUTPase dynamically associates with the mitotic spindle and centrosomes, and its depletion induces centrosome amplification and chromosome segregation defects. Beyond cell division, dUTPase dosage bidirectionally controls cell migration, linking its mitotic function to cellular behaviors relevant for metastasis. Together, our findings redefine dUTPase as a moonlighting mitotic factor that coordinates centrosome integrity and spindle dynamics, expanding its known repertoire beyond nucleotide metabolism.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Using rapid degradation of CCR4-NOT subunits in human cells, the authors show this complex suppresses pervasive transcription and LINE retrotransposon activity by modulating KRAB-ZNF repression and promoting retrotransposon RNA decay.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> CCR4-NOT regulates multiple steps in gene regulation and has been well studied in budding yeast. Although primarily cytoplasmic, where it plays an essential role in mRNA degradation, the human complex has poorly characterized nuclear functions. Here, we used auxin-induced degradation to rapidly deplete the scaffold subunit CNOT1 and the E3 ligase CNOT4, and characterized the transcriptional functions of the human CCR4-NOT complex. Using transient transcriptome profiling (TT-Seq) to measure ongoing transcription, we found widespread activation of RNA synthesis in depleted cells across genic and intergenic regions. Interestingly, fewer genes were repressed, including KRAB-Zinc-Finger-protein (KZNF) genes, especially those on chromosome 19. KZNFs repress genes and retrotransposable elements (rTEs), and consistent with decreased KZNF expression, rTEs, mainly Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs), were activated. Full-length active LINEs and rTEs lying outside of genes were activated, suggesting that the increased transcription is not the direct result of transcription of the genes the rTEs are embedded in. We found that most activated transcription events were in proximity to KZNF binding sites, suggesting that KZNF regulation contributes to the suppression of genic and rTE transcription. Finally, we demonstrate that CCR4-NOT regulates the stability of rTE RNAs, indicating that the complex tightly controls transposon expression by repressing transcription and targeting their RNAs for decay.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This preprint shows that inosine misincorporation into mRNA (normally prevented by ITPase) activates the integrated stress response via PKR and induces an innate immune-like transcriptional program, highlighting how non-canonical nucleotides in RNA can act as a potent cellular stress signal.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPase) enzyme restricts levels of the non-canonical nucleotides (deoxy)inosine triphosphate (dITP/ITP) and prevents their aberrant misincorporation into nucleic acids. ITPase deficiency is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and epileptic encephalopathy in humans and is usually fatal in infancy. It leads to pronounced inosine misincorporation into RNA but the cellular consequences of this misincorporation are not well understood and the pathogenic basis of ITPase deficiency remains unknown. Here we show that cellular transfection of mRNA with inosine misincorporation activates the integrated stress response (ISR) with an innate immune gene expression signature. This stress response triggers stress granule formation and is modulated by the double stranded RNA sensor protein Kinase R (PKR). Inosine nucleoside treatment of ITPase-deficient cells leads to endogenous inosine misincorporation into mRNA and activation of the ISR. Further, differentiation of human ITPase-deficient induced pluripotent stem cells into neurons results in a low-level stress response. Thus, our study establishes inosine misincorporation into mRNA as an unappreciated form of cellular stress. This is normally prevented by the ITPase enzyme, with implications for the pathogenesis of ITPase deficiency.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study dissects transient DNA-dependent dimerization and partner-assisted catalysis of the eukaryotic meiotic nuclease Spo11, offering mechanistic insight into modern DNA-processing complexes but with only indirect relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spo11 initiates meiotic recombination by introducing programmed DNA double-strand breaks. DNA cleavage occurs via a topoisomerase-like mechanism involving hybrid active sites formed at the dimer interface. However, in contrast to its topoisomerase relative (Topo VI), Spo11 does not form a stable dimer, likely to prevent uncontrolled DNA cleavage. Here, we investigated the dimerization of S. cerevisiae Spo11 in complex with its partners Ski8, Rec102, and Rec104. We show that the Spo11 complex dimerizes transiently on DNA, forming unstable dimeric complexes with duplex and branched DNA substrates. Guided by AlphaFold modeling of a pre-cleavage complex, we identified mutations that reduce dimerization. Surprisingly, DSB formation is resilient to mutagenesis of the Spo11 dimer interface, implying that additional factors promote dimerization in vivo. Finally, we found that Rec102 exerts a key DNA-binding function, essential for catalysis, and show that it also participates in dimerization through trans contacts with Ski8. Our work provides new insights into the mechanism of Spo11 dimerization and the role of its partners in initiating meiotic recombination.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Using targeted cytosine base-editing in native chromatin, the study shows that human MBD4 base-excision repair cooperates with a replication-independent, PMS1/MLH1-dependent non-canonical mismatch repair pathway to fix 5mC deamination (T:G) lesions, shaping CpG mutational patterns relevant to genome evolution and cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> CpG dinucleotides are hotspots for mutagenesis by spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into thymine, resulting in T:G mismatches that can lead to C&gt;T transitions. These mutations are a hallmark of aging and cancer and a major force shaping the evolution of vertebrate genomes. We have previously uncovered MBD4 as the primary base excision repair (BER) glycosylase responsible for 5mC deamination repair. In this study, we employ a cytosine base-editing system, comprising an APOBEC1 deaminase fused to a catalytically dead Cas9, to induce targeted cytosine deamination in native chromatin and track its repair. This approach reveals that MBD4 cooperates with a non-canonical branch of mismatch repair (MMR) to elicit 5mC deamination repair. We demonstrate that MBD4 activity depends on MMR complexes MutS (MSH2-MSH6) and MutL{beta} (MLH1-PMS1), but not on post-replicative MMR elicited by the MutL (MLH1-PMS2) complex. We find that PMS1 loss phenocopies the genome-wide CpG&gt;TpG hypermutated profile associated with MBD4 deficiency, uncovering that 5mC deamination repair may represent one of the primary functions of the MutL{beta} complex. The mutational landscape of MMR-deficient tumors aligns with our experimental results, showing that replication-independent CpG&gt;TpG mutagenesis partly contributes to the mutational burden of tumors inactivated for MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6. Finally, using structural predictions alongside biochemical validation, we show that MBD4 physically interacts with MutL{beta} in an MLH1-dependent manner, illuminating the structural basis for the convergence of the BER and MMR pathways. Altogether, we uncover a novel function of non-canonical MMR that underscores its interplay with BER in safeguarding genomic integrity against damage to methylated DNA.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces PORTAL and CAP cloning to enable ultrahigh-complexity CRISPR perturbation libraries and large-scale genetic interaction mapping in human cells using quantitative RNA readouts, with minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> CRISPR screens have become essential tools for systematically probing gene function from basic biology to drug discovery, yet important frontiers remain beyond genome scale. Probing regulatory elements, interpreting genetic variants, and mapping genetic interactions all challenge the sensitivity and scalability of existing approaches. Here we introduce two synergistic technologies to address these limitations. PORTAL (Perturbation Output via Reporter Transcriptional Activity in Lineages) shifts pooled genetics toward quantitative RNA phenotypes, encoding perturbation effects in expressed transcripts to enable single-molecule measurements with lineage or single-cell resolution. CAP cloning (Covalently closed Assembly Products) bypasses bacterial transformation to enable construction of ultrahigh-complexity lentiviral libraries. Combining these advances, we construct a genetic interaction map spanning 665,856 pairwise perturbations across 46 million clonal lineages - the largest exhaustive map in human cells and the first at this scale using a non-fitness phenotype. More broadly, this work charts a path toward comprehensive genetic interaction mapping in human cells.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> During early embryonic development, cells transition from naive to primed pluripotent state. Various culture conditions have been established to revert primed cells back to naive state, to increase differentiation potential and to reset epigenetic abnormalities. In this study, we modified culture conditions to allow primed-to-naive conversion under feeder-independent and normoxic conditions (FINO medium), which exemplified the need for a quantitative measure of pluripotent states. DNA methylation (DNAm) profiling revealed extensive hypomethylation at naive state, but also significant gains of methylation at specific sites in the genome. We demonstrate that DNAm patterns can be used to benchmark culture protocols. Furthermore, we developed a naive-score based on DNAm at two genomic sites, which can be analyzed by digital PCR to monitor transition between pluripotent states. Our study describes a simplified culture protocol for primed-to-naive conversion, offers insights into the specific DNAm changes, and introduces a robust DNAm-based biomarker to track this process effectively.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Lipid nanoparticles are the leading platform for the delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics, yet their structural complexity remains a significant barrier to achieve rational design and predictable function. Part of this complexity arises from the non-equilibrium assemblies that are difficult to identify using ensemble average techniques given the substantial heterogeneity in all properties. Aiming to overcome the limitations of traditional characterization methods, we combined asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation with in-line small-angle X-ray scattering and spectroscopic analyses, nanoflow cytometry, and cryo-EM to construct detailed structural models of mRNA-loaded nanoparticles formulated with different amounts of mRNA loading (N/P ratios of 3 and 6). This combination of techniques revealed that microfluidic formulation produces structurally diverse nanoparticle subpopulations differing in size, anisotropy, and cargo loading. Notably, these variations extend to the particle internal organization: spheroidal geometries display densely loaded mRNA cores, whereas bleb-like morphologies exhibit reduced mRNA content relative to the lipid amount within segregated domains at the core. NanoFCM further shows that the N/P ratio modulates cargo distribution across individual nanoparticles, with N/P=6 yielding a more uniform mRNA copy number per particle across subpopulations than N/P=3. These differences resulted in higher transfection efficacies for the N/P=6 formulation, highlighting core organization and loading homogeneity as key parameters for efficacious delivery. Together, these results establish a direct link between LNP architecture, internal organization, cargo distribution, and transfection efficiency, underscoring the importance of accounting for heterogeneity in the rational design of nucleic acid delivery systems.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study reveals an ATM–RHEB–mTORC1–TFEB signaling axis linking DNA damage to lysosomal adaptation and recovery after genotoxic stress, offering cell-biology context but limited direct relevance to origins-of-life mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cells dynamically adapt to environmental stressors by rewiring signaling networks that coordinate growth, metabolism and genome maintenance. The DNA damage response (DDR) and mTORC1 signaling pathways govern DNA repair and cell growth, respectively, but how these pathways intersect remains incompletely understood. Here, we identify RHEB, the most direct mTORC1 activator, as a substrate of the DDR kinase ATM. Strikingly, we find that, although genotoxic stress differentially regulates mTORC1 activity, reducing the phosphorylation of its lysosomal target TFEB, while enhancing phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic target S6K, the DDR-induced phosphorylation of RHEB specifically controls the lysosomal mTORC1 signaling branch. Preventing RHEB phosphorylation impairs TFEB nuclear translocation and lysosome biogenesis upon DNA damage. Functionally, the RHEB phosphorylation-dependent TFEB response is required for proliferative recovery following genotoxic stress. These findings uncover an ATM-RHEB-mTORC1-TFEB signaling axis that links DNA damage to selective mTORC1 outputs, revealing a mechanism which enables cells to adapt to genotoxic cues.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> by Muyiwa S. Adegbaju, Oluwabuyikunmi Owo-Odusi, Eden T. Wirtz, Olanrewaju B. Morenikeji, Olusola Ojurongbe, Bolaji N. Thomas The concern regarding H5N1 outbreak, particularly the accelerated mutagenesis of its core genomic elements, underscores the persistent threat of influenza to global health. Neuraminidase (NA), a pivotal sialidase integral to virion egress and propagation, comprises nine distinct isoforms, exhibiting unique evolutionary trajectories and structural adaptations. Despite extensive characterization of hemagglutinin subtypes, the functional divergence of the nine NA subtypes remains inadequately understood. To address this gap, we conducted a structural analysis of NA subtypes, employing structural superimposition and motif-guided sequence alignment to delineate subtype-specific residues. Hierarchical clustering stratified the nine NA subtypes into four distinct subgroups: NA2 (subgroup I), NA1 and NA4 (subgroup II), NA9/NA7/NA6/NA3 (subgroup III), and NA8/NA5 (subgroup 4). We identified 40 highly conserved and functionally significant amino acid loci, likely modulating enzymatic activity and substrate specificity across subtypes. To investigate the structural basis of adaptation in H5N1, we generated NA1 mutants by swapping family specific position (FSP) residues and analyzed their dynamics using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, complemented by a deep phylogenetic analysis across six host reservoirs. MD simulation parameters reveal a dynamic paradox: the Wild-Type (WT) NA1 maintains a conserved global compactness Rg, which masks a complex, bi-modal switching mechanism essential for its catalytic function, validated by multi-basin free energy landscape (FEL) topography. We identify Lysine-207 (K207) as the master determinant of this switching mechanism and the enzyme’s dynamic fate. Substitutions at this conserved nexus produced diametrically opposite outcomes: K207W imposed structural rigidification (abolishing the switch), K207H achieved dynamic preservation, and K207I drove expanded disorder and collapse. Furthermore, dynamic correlation analysis shows that these single-point substitutions function as molecular switches that significantly re-wire the enzyme’s allosteric communication networks, extending far beyond the active site. To assess the role of NA1 in host tropism and adaptive evolution, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of NA1 genes from H5N1 isolates across multiple host reservoirs; H. sapiens , G. gallus , Anser anser domesticus , M. gallopavo , B. taurus , and C. olor . Notably, we observed opposing selection pressures and diversification patterns: G. gallus isolates showed signatures of positive selection consistent with hyper-reassortment, while human isolates displayed highly diverse, sporadic spillover events. We conclude that the evolutionary contribution of NA1 to H5N1 host adaptation is not encoded in static structure, but certain residues such as K207 defines a pivotal mechanism for regulating the enzyme’s function through dynamic states. Our MD data thus proposes a novel strategy for next-generation antivirals by targeting this dynamic vulnerability—the Nexus for Dynamic Ablation—to permanently entrain the enzyme in a non-functional conformation.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> The paper develops mean-field theory for correlated-noise effects in quadratic integrate-and-fire neural networks, which is not related to origins-of-life or astrobiology topics.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10032v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The presence of correlated noise, arising from a mixture of independent fluctuations and a common noisy input shared across the neural population, is a ubiquitous feature of neural circuits, yet its impact on collective network dynamics remains poorly understood. We analyze a network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons driven by Gaussian noise with a tunable degree of correlation. Using the cumulant expansion method, we derive a reduced set of effective mean-field equations that accurately describe the evolution of the population&#x27;s mean firing rate and membrane potential. Our analysis reveals a counterintuitive phenomenon: increasing the noise correlation strength suppresses the mean network activity, an effect we term correlated-noise-inhibited spiking. Furthermore, within a specific parameter regime, the network exhibits metastability, manifesting itself as spontaneous, noise-driven transitions between distinct high- and low-activity states. These results provide a theoretical framework for reducing the dynamics of complex stochastic networks and demonstrate how correlated noise can fundamentally regulate macroscopic neural activity, with implications for understanding state transitions in biological systems.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Develops and analyzes finite-lattice kinetic equations for bosons, fermions, and discrete nonlinear Schrödinger systems via cumulant-hierarchy truncation, with results on well-posedness, decay, and robustness to energy-delta approximations.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10486v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We introduce and study finite lattice kinetic equations for bosons, fermions, and discrete NLS. For each model this closed evolution equation provides an approximate description for the evolution of the appropriate covariance function in the system. It is obtained by truncating the cumulant hierarchy and dropping the higher order cumulants in the usual manner. To have such a reference solution should simplify controlling the full hierarchy and thus allow estimating the error from the truncation. The harmonic part is given by nearest neighbour hopping, with arbitrary symmetric interaction potential of coupling strength $\lambda&gt;0$. We consider the well-posedness of the resulting evolution equation up to finite kinetic times on a finite but large enough lattice. We obtain decay of the solutions and upper bounds that are independent of $\lambda$ and depend on the lattice size only via some Sobolev type norms of the interaction potential and initial data. We prove that the solutions are not sensitive to how the energy conservation delta function is approximated.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Uses statistical-physics models on planar graphs to derive topological conditions for long-range order/self-organisation under local interactions, offering broad (but indirect) conceptual relevance to how prebiotic or early biological systems might sustain organized states.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2501.13188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: All intelligence is collective intelligence, in the sense that it is made of parts which must align with respect to system-level goals. Understanding the dynamics which facilitate or limit navigation of problem spaces by aligned parts thus impacts many fields ranging across life sciences and engineering. To that end, consider a system on the vertices of a planar graph, with pairwise interactions prescribed by the edges of the graph. Such systems can sometimes exhibit long-range order, distinguishing one phase of macroscopic behaviour from another. In networks of interacting systems we may view spontaneous ordering as a form of self-organisation, modelling neural and basal forms of cognition. Here, we discuss necessary conditions on the topology of the graph for an ordered phase to exist, with an eye towards finding constraints on the ability of a system with local interactions to maintain an ordered target state. By studying the scaling of free energy under the formation of domain walls in three model systems -- the Potts model, autoregressive models, and hierarchical networks -- we show how the combinatorics of interactions on a graph prevent or allow spontaneous ordering. As an application we are able to analyse why multiscale systems like those prevalent in biology are capable of organising into complex patterns, whereas rudimentary language models are challenged by long sequences of outputs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10540v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Burst errors involving simultaneous insertions, deletions, and substitutions occur in practical scenarios, including DNA data storage and document synchronization, motivating developments of channel codes that can correct such errors. In this paper, we address the problem of constructing error-correcting codes (ECCs) capable of handling multiple bursts of $t_1$-deletion-$t_2$-insertion ($(t_1,t_2)$-DI) errors, where each burst consists of $t_1$ deletions followed by $t_2$ insertions in a binary sequence. We make three key contributions: Firstly, we establish the fundamental equivalence of (1) two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs, (2) two bursts of $(t_2,t_1)$-DI ECCs, and (3) one burst each of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI and $(t_2,t_1)$-DI ECCs. Then, we derive lower and upper bounds on the code size of two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs, which can naturally be extended to the case of multiple bursts. Finally, we present constructions of two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs. Compared to the codes obtained by the syndrome compression technique, the resulting codes achieve significantly lower computational complexity.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10256v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We introduce the sum channel, a new channel model motivated by applications in distributed storage and DNA data storage. In the error-free case, it takes as input an $\ell$-row binary matrix and outputs an $(\ell+1)$-row matrix whose first $\ell$ rows equal the input and whose last row is their parity (sum) row. We construct a two-deletion-correcting code with redundancy $2\lceil\log_2\log_2 n\rceil + O(\ell^2)$ for $\ell$-row inputs. When $\ell=2$, we establish an upper bound of $\lceil\log_2\log_2 n\rceil + O(1)$, implying that our redundancy is optimal up to a factor of 2. We also present a code correcting a single substitution with $\lceil \log_2(\ell+1)\rceil$ redundant bits and prove that it is within one bit of optimality.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10263v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In the field of artificial intelligence, real parameter single objective optimization is an important direction. Both the Differential Evolution (DE) and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) demonstrate good performance for real parameter single objective optimization. Nevertheless, there exist other types of evolutionary algorithm for the purpose. In recent years, researchers begin to study long-term search. EA4eig - an ensemble of three DE variants and CMA-ES - performs well for long-term search. In this paper, we introduce two types of evolutionary algorithm proposed recently - crisscross search and sparrow search - into EA4eig as secondary evolutionary algorithms to process inferior individuals. Thus, EA4eigCS is obtained. In our ensemble, the secondary evolutionary algorithms are expected to vary distribution of the population for breaking stagnation. Experimental results show that our EA4eigCS outperforms EA4eig and is competitive when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10329v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We investigate the capacity of noisy frequency-based channels, motivated by DNA data storage in the short-molecule regime, where information is encoded in the frequency of items types rather than their order. The channel output is a histogram formed by random sampling of items, followed by noisy item identification. While the capacity of the noiseless frequency-based channel has been previously addressed, the effect of identification noise has not been fully characterized. We present a converse bound on the channel capacity that follows from stochastic degradation and the data processing inequality. We then establish an achievable bound, which is based on a Poissonization of the multinomial sampling process, and an analysis of the resulting vector Poisson channel with inter-symbol interference. This analysis refines concentration inequalities for the information density used in Feinstein bound, and explicitly characterizes an additive loss in the mutual information due to identification noise. We apply our results to a DNA storage channel in the short-molecule regime, and quantify the resulting loss in the scaling of the total number of reliably stored bits.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2504.20891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Quantum systems that interact non-locally with an environment are paradigms for exploring collective phenomena. They naturally emerge in various physical contexts involving long-range, many-body interactions. We consider a general class of such open systems characterized by a coupling to the environment which is inversely proportional to the square root of the environment size. We show that the induced system dynamics has a universal bosonic nature: the same evolution arises from coupling the system to a collection of noninteracting bosonic modes, independently of the microscopic structure of the original environment. This emergent &quot;bosonization&quot; of the environment&#x27;s influence results from the scaling of the coupling in the thermodynamic limit and is a manifestation of the quantum central limit theorem. While the effect has been observed in specific models before, we show that it is, in fact, a universal feature.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10657v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful operators for evolutionary search, yet the design of efficient search scaffolds remains ad hoc. While promising, current LLM-in-the-loop systems lack a systematic approach to managing the evolutionary process. We identify three distinct failure modes: Context Pollution, where experiment history biases future candidate generation; Mode Collapse, where agents stagnate in local minima due to poor exploration-exploitation balance; and Weak Collaboration, where rigid crossover strategies fail to leverage parallel search trajectories effectively. We introduce Progress-Aware Consistent Evolution (PACEvolve), a framework designed to robustly govern the agent&#x27;s context and search dynamics, to address these challenges. PACEvolve combines hierarchical context management (HCM) with pruning to address context pollution; momentum-based backtracking (MBB) to escape local minima; and a self-adaptive sampling policy that unifies backtracking and crossover for dynamic search coordination (CE), allowing agents to balance internal refinement with cross-trajectory collaboration. We demonstrate that PACEvolve provides a systematic path to consistent, long-horizon self-improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLM-SR and KernelBench, while discovering solutions surpassing the record on Modded NanoGPT.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2507.09614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Symmetries are a key tool in understanding quantum systems, and, among many other things, can be exploited to increase the efficiency of numerical simulations of quantum dynamics. Disordered systems usually feature reduced symmetries and additionally require averaging over many realizations, making their numerical study computationally demanding. However, when studying quantities linear in the time-evolved state, i.e. expectation values of observables, one can apply the averaging procedure to the time evolution operator, resulting in an effective dynamical map, which restores symmetry at the level of superoperators. In this work, we develop schemes for efficiently constructing symmetric sectors of the disorder-averaged dynamical map using short-time and weak-disorder expansions. To benchmark the method, we apply it to an Ising model with random all-to-all interactions in the presence of a transverse field. After disorder averaging, this system becomes effectively permutation-invariant, and thus the size of the symmetric subspace scales polynomially in the number of spins allowing for the simulation of large systems.</p>

MCEMOL employs dual-layer evolution: optimizing transformation rules at rule level while applying crossover and mutation to molecular structures. Unlike deep learning methods requiring large datasets and extensive training, our algorithm evolves efficiently from minimal starting molecules with low computational overhead. The framework incorporates message-passing neural networks and comprehensive chemical constraints, ensuring efficient and interpretable molecular design. Experimental results demonstrate that MCEMOL provides transparent design pathways through its evolutionary mechanism while generating valid, diverse, target-compliant molecules. The framework achieves 100% molecular validity with high structural diversity and excellent drug-likeness compliance, showing strong performance in symmetry constraints, pharmacophore optimization, and stereochemical integrity. Unlike black-box methods, MCEMOL delivers dual value: interpretable transformation rules researchers can understand and trust, alongside high-quality molecular libraries for practical applications. This establishes a paradigm where interpretable AI-driven drug design and effective molecular generation are achieved simultaneously, bridging the gap between computational innovation and practical drug discovery needs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10333v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Disordered spatial networks are model systems that describe structures and interactions across multiple length scales. Scattering and interference of waves in these networks can give rise to structural phase transitions, localization, diffusion, and band gaps. The study of these complex phenomena requires efficient numerical methods to computer-generate disordered networks with targeted structural properties. In the established Wooten-Weaire-Winer algorithm, a series of bond switch moves introduces disorder into an initial network. Conventional strain energies that govern this evolution are limited to 3D networks with coordination numbers of no more than four. We extend the algorithm to arbitrary coordination number statistics by introducing bond repulsion in the Keating strain energy. We tune the degree and type of disorder introduced into initially crystalline networks by varying the bond-bending force constant in the strain energy and the temperature profile. The effects of these variables are analyzed using a list of order metrics that capture both direct and reciprocal space. A feedforward neural network is trained to predict the structural characteristics from the algorithm inputs, enabling targeted network generation. As a case study, we statistically reproduce four disordered biophotonic networks exhibiting structural color. This work presents a versatile method for generating disordered networks with tailored structural properties. It will enable new insights into structure-property relations, such as photonic band gaps in disordered networks.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10684v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Scaling laws have played a major role in the modern AI revolution, providing practitioners predictive power over how the model performance will improve with increasing data, compute, and number of model parameters. This has spurred an intense interest in the origin of neural scaling laws, with a common suggestion being that they arise from power law structure already present in the data. In this paper we study scaling laws for transformers trained to predict random walks (bigrams) on graphs with tunable complexity. We demonstrate that this simplified setting already gives rise to neural scaling laws even in the absence of power law structure in the data correlations. We further consider dialing down the complexity of natural language systematically, by training on sequences sampled from increasingly simplified generative language models, from 4,2,1-layer transformer language models down to language bigrams, revealing a monotonic evolution of the scaling exponents. Our results also include scaling laws obtained from training on random walks on random graphs drawn from Erd\&quot;os-Renyi and scale-free Barab\&#x27;asi-Albert ensembles. Finally, we revisit conventional scaling laws for language modeling, demonstrating that several essential results can be reproduced using 2 layer transformers with context length of 50, provide a critical analysis of various fits used in prior literature, demonstrate an alternative method for obtaining compute optimal curves as compared with current practice in published literature, and provide preliminary evidence that maximal update parameterization may be more parameter efficient than standard parameterization.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces an LLM-guided evolutionary framework (MPaGE) for designing diverse, fast heuristics in multi-objective combinatorial optimization, with relevance limited to the generic concept of evolution rather than origins-of-life science.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2507.20923v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently, integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO) framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster runtime.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.09835v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Secular perturbations from binary stars and distant massive planets can drive cold planets onto nearly parabolic orbits with pericenter passages extremely close to their host stars. Meanwhile, short-period super-Earths are frequently observed around nearby stars. Gravitational scattering between these two distinct populations can lead to substantial orbital energy exchange, liberating some intruders from the gravitational confinement of their host systems. This process offers a robust formation channel for a subset of the abundant freely floating planet population. It may also significantly perturb the original orbits of close-in planets, induce collisional trajectories between close-in planets and their host stars, and disrupt the dynamical evolution of cold planets toward close stellar encounters.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.09845v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Predicting biomolecular thermodynamics and spectroscopy requires accurate relative energies of metastable states and local curvatures on the potential-energy surface. We show that the general-purpose SO3LR machine-learned force field (MLFF) reproduces PBE0+MBD density-functional theory with unprecedented fidelity across bio-relevant molecules spanning sizes and complexities far beyond its training dataset. For 23 small molecules, SO3LR captures harmonic and anharmonic vibrational features, including frequencies, displacement patterns, and IR spectra. We perform detailed dynamical studies of the amino acid oF-Phe+, folding of the alanine-15 peptide, and assembly of monomeric p53 transactivation domains into tetramers, in vacuum and water. SO3LR consistently reproduces DFT-level potential-energy surfaces, vibrational densities of states, and mode eigenvectors, capturing anharmonicity, polarization, and medium-range environment-driven interactions crucial for proteins. Our results establish that MLFF-driven dynamics provide a quantum-accurate picture of metastable minima and vibrational properties, achieving DFT-level accuracy at force-field computational cost and opening new possibilities for the computational study of biomolecules.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10181v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Climate prediction is a challenge due to the intricate spatiotemporal patterns within Earth systems. Global climate indices, such as the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for long-term rainfall prediction. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel NorthEast monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas. This approach effectively reduces the Root Mean Square Error for 12-month-ahead forecasts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10508v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Planet population synthesis is an integral tool for linking exoplanets to their formation environments. Most planet population synthesis studies have focused on the carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) in gas or solids, yet more insight into planet formation may be afforded by considering a wider suite of elements. Sulfur is one such key element. It has been assumed to be entirely refractory in population synthesis models, restricting it to being a tracer of accreted rocky solids. However, sulfur also has a volatile reservoir dominant at the onset of star and planet formation. We investigate sulfur&#x27;s wider potential as a formation history tracer by implementing the first multi-phase treatment of S in a planet population synthesis model. We present the planet formation module of \textsc{sponchpop} and its first predicted planet growth tracks and populations. We explore the diversity of planet compositions in terms of their sulfur budget, including both refractory and volatile components, and apply a novel gas-grain conversion of sulfur to study how formation trajectories of giant planets relate to final core and envelope compositions. We show that planets inherit a wide range of core and envelope sulfur content related to accretion history while considering late-stage planetesimal infall, providing a new diagnostic tool for planet formation. The diverse sulfur content of planet cores suggests some rocky planets may be born sulfur-poor, with implications for their geochemistry and habitability. Enhanced sulfur abundances in gas-giant atmospheres can be attributed to formation beyond the H2S iceline, such as the giants in our Solar System.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10285v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Past studies have revealed the dependency of the disc parameters (mass, radius, viscosity, grain fragmentation velocity, dust-to-gas ratio) on the formation of giant planets, where more massive discs seem beneficial for giant planet formation. It is unclear how the different disc properties influence the composition of forming giant planets. The idea that the atmospheric abundances can trace directly the formation location of planets is put into question, due to the chemical evolution of the disc, caused by inward drifting and evaporating pebbles. This complicates the idea of a relation between atmospheric abundances and planet formation locations. We use planet formation simulations that include the effects of pebble drift and evaporation and investigate how the different disc parameters influence the atmospheric composition of giant planets. We focus on the atmospheric C/O, C/H, O/H and S/H ratios allowing us to probe tracers for volatiles and refractories and thus different accretion pathways of giant planets. We find that most of the disc parameters have only a limited influence on the atmospheric abundances of gas giants, except for the dust-to-gas ratio, where a larger value results in higher atmospheric abundances. However the atmospheric abundances are determined by the planetary formation location, even in the pebble drift and evaporation scenario. Our study suggests that volatile-rich giant exoplanets predominantly form in the inner disc regions, where they can accrete large fractions of vapour-enhanced gas. Our study shows that simulations that try to trace the origin of giant planets via their atmospheric abundances do not have to probe all disc parameters, as long as the disc parameters allow the formation of giant planets. Our study thus suggests that the diversity of observed planetary compositions is a direct consequence of their formation location and migration history.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10450v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The structure and evolution of close-in exoplanets are shaped by atmospheric loss and migration processes, which give rise to key population features such as the hot Neptune desert, ridge, and savanna - regions of the period-radius space whose boundaries offer critical insights into planetary formation and survival. As part of the KESPRINT collaboration, we selected the TESS transiting planet candidate TOI-3862.01 for radial velocity follow-up to confirm its planetary nature and characterize its mass and bulk properties. This planet candidate is of particular interest due to its position in the middle of the hot Neptune desert, making it a valuable probe for testing theories of planet migration and atmospheric loss. We confirmed the planetary nature and determined the mass of TOI-3862.01 (hereinafter TOI-3862b) by performing a joint fit with both transit and radial velocity data, precisely characterizing the bulk properties of this planet. TOI-3862b is a super-Neptune on a 1.56-day orbit around a Sun-like star with an effective temperature of 5300$\pm$50K. It has a mass of 53.7$_{-2.9}^{+2.8}$ M$_{\oplus}$ and a radius of 5.53$\pm$0.18 R$_{\oplus}$, corresponding to a density of 1.7$\pm$0.2 g/cm^3. This places it among the rare population of hot and dense super-Neptune desert planets. TOI-3862b, residing deep in the hot Neptune desert, represents a rare occurrence in an otherwise sparsely populated region, offering a valuable opportunity to probe the processes that may allow planets to survive in such environments.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10666v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The near-Earth asteroid 2024 YR4 -- a $\sim$60 m rocky object that was once considered a potential Earth impactor -- has since been ruled out for Earth but retained a $\sim$4.3% probability of striking the Moon in 2032. Such an impact, with equivalent kinetic energy of $\sim$6.5 Mt TNT, is expected to produce a $\sim$1 km crater on the Moon, and will be the most energetic lunar impact event ever recorded in human history. Despite the associated risk, this scenario offers a rare and valuable scientific opportunity. Using a hybrid framework combining Monte Carlo orbital propagation, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) impact modeling, and N-body ejecta dynamics, we evaluate the physical outcomes and propose the observation timelines of this rare event. Our results suggest an optical flash of visual magnitude from -2.5 to -3 lasting several minutes directly after the impact, followed by hours of infrared afterglow from $\sim$2000 K molten rock cooling to a few hundred K. The associated seismic energy release would lead to a global-scale lunar reverberation (magnitude $\sim$5.0) that can be detectable by modern seismometers. Furthermore, the impact would eject $\sim$10$^8$ kg of debris that escapes the lunar gravity, with a small fraction reaching Earth to produce a lunar meteor outburst within 100 years. Finally, we integrate these results into a coordinated observation timeline, identifying the best detection windows for ground-based telescopes, lunar orbiters, and surface stations.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10598v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The Galaxy&#x27;s most common known planetary systems have several Earth-to-Neptune-size planets in compact orbits. At small orbital separations, larger planets are less common than their smaller counterparts by an order of magnitude. The young star V1298 Tau hosts one such compact planetary system, albeit with four planets that are uncommonly large (5 to 10 Earth radii). The planets form a chain of near-resonances that result in transit-timing variations of several hours. Here we present a multi-year campaign to characterize this system with transit-timing variations, a method insensitive to the intense magnetic activity of the star. Through targeted observations, we first resolved the previously unknown orbital period of the outermost planet. The full 9-year baseline from these and archival data then enabled robust determination of the masses and orbital parameters for all four planets. We find the planets have low, sub-Neptune masses and nearly circular orbits, implying a dynamically tranquil history. Their low masses and large radii indicate that the inner planets underwent a period of rapid cooling immediately after dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Still, they are much less dense than mature planets of comparable size. We predict the planets will contract to 1.5-4.0 Earth radii and join the population of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes that nature produces in abundance.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2501.14054v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: While most of the 6000 discovered exoplanets are highly unlike the Earth, the first rocky worlds in the Habitable Zone (HZ) provide intriguing targets for the search for life in the cosmos. As detections increase, it is critical to test the empirical HZ as well as its limits using known exoplanets. However, there is not yet a list of rocky worlds that observers can use to test the limits of surface habitability. We analysed data from Gaia DR3 and the NASA Exoplanet Archive (NEA) of all known exoplanets, identifying future targets to test limits of habitability through i) orbits near the edges of the HZ, ii) similar irradiation environments to modern Earth, and iii) large eccentricities. We prioritize targets for transmission observations, light curve measurements, and direct imaging, identify the oldest HZ rocky worlds based on the NEA and complementary literature data, and provide theoretical limits for the empirical HZ and a 3D-HZ for each system. Our analysis shows 45 rocky worlds in the empirical HZ and 24 in a narrower 3D-HZ. For context, we compare their demographics to those of the full catalog of exoplanets in the NEA. The resulting list of rocky exoplanet targets in the HZ will allow observers to shape and optimize search strategies with space- and ground-based telescopes -- such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), and LIFE -- and design new observing strategies and instruments to explore these worlds, addressing the question of the limits of exoplanet surface habitability.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2510.08681v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Many evolutionary models of giant exoplanets still rely on simplifying assumptions that are no longer adequate given detailed constraints from Jupiter, Saturn, and modern exoplanet observations. Here, we identify the key physical improvements required for next-generation planetary evolution models using our code, \texttt{APPLE}, which enables systematic emulation and extension of legacy studies. We quantify the effects of updated equations of state, helium rain, fuzzy cores, non-adiabatic and compositionally inhomogeneous envelopes, and improved atmospheric boundary conditions by first isolating the impact of each physical ingredient and then constructing combined baseline models for planets with masses between 0.3 and 4~$M_{\rm Jup}$ to assess their collective influence on planetary structure and observable properties. We find that the adoption of modern equations of state and realistic heavy-element distributions leads to systematic, but sometimes subtle, differences ($\sim 5$ to 10\%) in radius evolution, while helium rain and the treatment of convection can significantly alter thermal histories and atmospheric compositions (by $\sim$ 5 to 20\%). These updated physical processes must be incorporated into the next-generation exoplanet evolutionary models to achieve physically consistent interpretations of planetary observations.</p>

Using the cumulant expansion method, we derive a reduced set of effective mean-field equations that accurately describe the evolution of the population&#x27;s mean firing rate and membrane potential. Our analysis reveals a counterintuitive phenomenon: increasing the noise correlation strength suppresses the mean network activity, an effect we term correlated-noise-inhibited spiking. Furthermore, within a specific parameter regime, the network exhibits metastability, manifesting itself as spontaneous, noise-driven transitions between distinct high- and low-activity states. These results provide a theoretical framework for reducing the dynamics of complex stochastic networks and demonstrate how correlated noise can fundamentally regulate macroscopic neural activity, with implications for understanding state transitions in biological systems.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Reports a well-characterized, low-density sub-Neptune (TOI-5789 c) around a bright K dwarf as a promising target for JWST/Ariel atmospheric characterization, but it is primarily an exoplanet system discovery/characterization paper with limited direct Origins-of-Life relevance.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2510.11490v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Sub-Neptunes with planetary radii of $R_{p} \simeq 2-4 R_{\oplus}$ are the most common planets around solar-type stars in short-period ($P&lt;100$ d) orbits. It is still unclear, however, what their most likely composition is, that is whether they are predominantly gas dwarfs or water worlds. The sub-Neptunes orbiting bright host stars are very valuable because they are suitable for atmospheric characterization, which can break the well-known degeneracy in planet composition from the planet bulk density, when combined with a precise and accurate mass measurement. Here we report on the characterization of the sub-Neptune TOI-5789 c, which transits in front of the bright ($V=7.3$ mag and $K_{s}=5.35$ mag) and magnetically inactive K1V dwarf HIP 99452 every 12.93 days, thanks to TESS photometry and 141 high-precision radial velocities obtained with the HARPS-N spectrograph. We find that its radius, mass, and bulk density are $R_{c}=2.86^{+0.18}_{-0.15} R_\oplus$, $M_{c}=5.00 \pm 0.50 M_\oplus$, and $\rho_{c}=1.16 \pm 0.23$ g cm$^{-3}$, and we show that TOI-5789 c is a promising target for atmospheric characterization with both JWST and, in the future, Ariel. By analyzing the HARPS-N radial velocities with different tools, we also detect three additional non-transiting planets, namely TOI-5789 b, d, and e, with orbital periods and minimum masses of $P_{b}=2.76$ d, $M_{b}\sin{i}=2.12 \pm 0.28 M_\oplus$, $P_{d}=29.6$ d, $M_{d}\sin{i}=4.29 \pm 0.68 M_\oplus$, and $P_{e}=63.0$ d, $M_{e}\sin{i}=11.61 \pm 0.97 M_\oplus$. TOI-5789 is a mutually inclined system as the difference between the orbital inclinations of planets b and c must be higher than $\sim4$ deg. Nevertheless, from sensitivity studies based on both the HARPS-N and archival HIRES radial-velocity measurements, we can exclude that these relatively high mutual inclinations are due to the perturbation by an outer gaseous giant planet.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2501.13188v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: All intelligence is collective intelligence, in the sense that it is made of parts which must align with respect to system-level goals. Understanding the dynamics which facilitate or limit navigation of problem spaces by aligned parts thus impacts many fields ranging across life sciences and engineering. To that end, consider a system on the vertices of a planar graph, with pairwise interactions prescribed by the edges of the graph. Such systems can sometimes exhibit long-range order, distinguishing one phase of macroscopic behaviour from another. In networks of interacting systems we may view spontaneous ordering as a form of self-organisation, modelling neural and basal forms of cognition. Here, we discuss necessary conditions on the topology of the graph for an ordered phase to exist, with an eye towards finding constraints on the ability of a system with local interactions to maintain an ordered target state. By studying the scaling of free energy under the formation of domain walls in three model systems -- the Potts model, autoregressive models, and hierarchical networks -- we show how the combinatorics of interactions on a graph prevent or allow spontaneous ordering. As an application we are able to analyse why multiscale systems like those prevalent in biology are capable of organising into complex patterns, whereas rudimentary language models are challenged by long sequences of outputs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2506.05053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Liquid crystal mesophases of achiral molecules are normally achiral, yet in a few materials they spontaneously segregate and form right- and left-handed chiral domains. One mechanism that drives chiral segregation is molecular shape fluctuations between axial chiral conformations, where molecular interactions favor matching chirality and promote helical twist. Cooperative chiral ordering may also play a role in chirality amplification, as when a tiny fraction of chiral dopant drives a nematic phase to become cholesteric. We present a model of cooperative chiral ordering in liquid crystals using Maier-Saupe theory, and predict a phase diagram with a segregated cholesteric phase with alternating domains of left- and right-handed chiral twist, with opposite enantiomeric excess, in addition to racemic nematic and isotropic phases. Our model also demonstrates how chiral molecular fluctuations influence the helical twisting power of dopants in the nematic phase, which may be observed even in materials where the segregated cholesteric phase is preempted by a transition to another phase. We compare these results with Monte Carlo simulation studies of the switchable chiral Lebwohl-Lasher model, where each spin switches between right- and left-handed chiral states. Simulation results validate the predicted phase diagram, demonstrate chiral amplification in the racemic nematic phase, and reveal complex coarsening dynamics in the segregated cholesteric phase. These results suggest that molecular fluctuations between degenerate chiral configurations may be a common mechanism to produce cooperative chiral order in achiral liquid crystals.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.09915v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Effective water management is essential for the optimal performance of PEM fuel cells. We have developed an impedance model for liquid water transport through the membrane and coupled it with the two-phase model for cathode side impedance. The complete model was fitted to experimental spectra measured at anode/cathode relative humidities (RH) of 32/32\%, 50/50\% and 100/100\% within a current density range of 100 to 1000 mA cm$^{-2}$ and an air flow stoichiometry of 2. Cathode catalyst layer (CCL) saturation decreases with current density due to a growing liquid pressure gradient. For all RH values, the CCL oxygen diffusivity increases dramatically with cell current due to progressive involvement of larger pores into the proton current conversion. Higher RH leads to higher double layer capacitance, which indicates that liquid water increases the electrochemically active surface area.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.09845v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Predicting biomolecular thermodynamics and spectroscopy requires accurate relative energies of metastable states and local curvatures on the potential-energy surface. We show that the general-purpose SO3LR machine-learned force field (MLFF) reproduces PBE0+MBD density-functional theory with unprecedented fidelity across bio-relevant molecules spanning sizes and complexities far beyond its training dataset. For 23 small molecules, SO3LR captures harmonic and anharmonic vibrational features, including frequencies, displacement patterns, and IR spectra. We perform detailed dynamical studies of the amino acid oF-Phe+, folding of the alanine-15 peptide, and assembly of monomeric p53 transactivation domains into tetramers, in vacuum and water. SO3LR consistently reproduces DFT-level potential-energy surfaces, vibrational densities of states, and mode eigenvectors, capturing anharmonicity, polarization, and medium-range environment-driven interactions crucial for proteins. Our results establish that MLFF-driven dynamics provide a quantum-accurate picture of metastable minima and vibrational properties, achieving DFT-level accuracy at force-field computational cost and opening new possibilities for the computational study of biomolecules.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10166v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Quantum algorithms are gaining attention in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for their favorable scaling, as encoding physical fields into quantum probability amplitudes enables representation of two to the power of n spatial points with only n qubits. A key challenge in Quantum CFD is the efficient readout of simulation results, a topic that has received limited attention in literature. This work presents methods to extract statistical properties of spatial velocity fields, such as central moments and structure functions, directly from parameterized ansatz circuits, avoiding full quantum state tomography. As a proof of concept, we implement our approach for 1D velocity fields, encoding 16 spatial points with 4 qubits, and analyze both a sine wave signal and four snapshots from Burgers&#x27; equation evolution. Using Qedma&#x27;s error mitigation software QESEM, we demonstrate that such computations achieve high accuracy on current quantum devices, specifically IBMQ&#x27;s Heron2 system ibm_fez.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2501.05613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Cryogenic buffer gas sources are ubiquitous for producing cold, collimated molecular beams for quantum science, chemistry, and precision measurements. The molecules are typically produced by laser ablating a metal target in the presence of a donor gas. The radical of interest emerges due to a barrier-free reaction or under thermal or optical excitation. High-barrier reactions, such as between Ca and H$_2$, should be precluded. We study chemical reactions between Ca and three hydrogen isotopologues H$_2$, D$_2$, and HD in a cryogenic cell with helium buffer gas. We observe that H$_2$ can serve as both a reactant and a buffer gas, outperforming D$_2$ and HD. We use a reaction network model to describe the chemical dynamics and find that the enhanced molecular yield can be attributed to rapid vibrational excitations of the reactant gas. Our results demonstrate a robust method for generating bright cold beams of alkaline-earth-metal hydrides for laser cooling and trapping.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2507.13253v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: There has been a long debate on how new levels of organization have evolved. It might seem unlikely, as cooperation must prevail over competition. One well-studied example is the emergence of autocatalytic sets, which seem to be a prerequisite for the evolution of life. Using a simple model, we investigate how varying bias toward cooperation versus antagonism shapes network dynamics, revealing that higher-order organization emerges even amid pervasive antagonistic interactions. In general, we observe that a quantitative increase in the number of elements in a system leads to a qualitative transition. We present a random threshold-directed network model that integrates node-specific traits with dynamic edge formation and node removal, simulating arbitrary levels of cooperation and competition. In our framework, intrinsic node values determine directed links through various threshold rules. Our model generates a multi-digraph with signed edges (reflecting support/antagonism, labeled ``help&#x27;&#x27;/``harm&#x27;&#x27;), which ultimately yields two parallel yet interdependent threshold graphs. Incorporating temporal growth and node turnover in our approach allows exploration of the evolution, adaptation, and potential collapse of communities and reveals phase transitions in both connectivity and resilience. Our findings extend classical random threshold and Erd\H{o}s-R\&#x27;enyi models, offering new insights into adaptive systems in biological and economic contexts, with emphasis on the application to Collective Affordance Sets. This framework should also be useful for making predictions that will be tested by ongoing experiments of microbial communities in soil.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2412.17488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Photocatalytic water splitting has attracted considerable attention for renewable energy production. Since the first reported photocatalytic water splitting by titanium dioxide, this material remains one of the most promising photocatalysts, due to its suitable band gap and band-edge positions. However, predicting both of these properties is a challenging task for existing computational methods. Here we show how Koopmans spectral functionals can accurately predict the band structure and level alignment of rutile, anatase, and brookite TiO$_2$ using a computationally efficient workflow that only requires (a) a DFT calculation of the photocatalyst/vacuum interface and (b) a Koopmans spectral functional calculation of the bulk photocatalyst. The success of this approach for TiO$_2$ suggests that this strategy could be deployed for assessing the suitability of novel photocatalyst candidates.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2412.17488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Photocatalytic water splitting has attracted considerable attention for renewable energy production. Since the first reported photocatalytic water splitting by titanium dioxide, this material remains one of the most promising photocatalysts, due to its suitable band gap and band-edge positions. However, predicting both of these properties is a challenging task for existing computational methods. Here we show how Koopmans spectral functionals can accurately predict the band structure and level alignment of rutile, anatase, and brookite TiO$_2$ using a computationally efficient workflow that only requires (a) a DFT calculation of the photocatalyst/vacuum interface and (b) a Koopmans spectral functional calculation of the bulk photocatalyst. The success of this approach for TiO$_2$ suggests that this strategy could be deployed for assessing the suitability of novel photocatalyst candidates.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Develops coalescent-theory results and simulations for diploid populations with sweepstakes (highly skewed) reproduction, showing how such reproductive variance alters genealogies and can deviate from standard coalescent approximations.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10364v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recruitment dynamics, or the distribution of the number of offspring among individuals, is central for understanding ecology and evolution. Sweepstakes reproduction (heavy right-tailed offspring number distribution) is central for understanding the ecology and evolution of highly fecund natural populations. Sweepstakes reproduction can induce jumps in type frequencies and multiple mergers in gene genealogies of sampled gene copies. We take sweepstakes reproduction to be skewed offspring number distribution due to mechanisms not involving natural selection, such as in chance matching of broadcast spawning with favourable environmental conditions. Here, we consider population genetic models of sweepstakes reproduction in a diploid panmictic populations absent selfing and evolving in a random environment. Our main results are {\it (i)} continuous-time Beta and Poisson-Dirichlet coalescents, when combining the results the skewness parameter $\alpha$ of the Beta-coalescent ranges from $0$ to $2$, and the Beta-coalescents may be incomplete due to an upper bound on the number of potential offspring produced by any pair of parents; {\it (ii)} in large populations time is measured in units proportional to either $N/\log N$ or $N$ generations (where $2N$ is the population size when constant); {\it (iii)} it follows that incorporating population size changes leads to time-changed coalescents with the time-change independent of $\alpha$; {\it (iv)} using simulations we show that the ancestral process is not well approximated by the corresponding coalescent (as measured through certain functionals of the processes); {\it (v)} whenever the skewness of the offspring number distribution is increased the conditional (conditioned on the population ancestry) and the unconditional ancestral processes are not in good agreement.</p>
