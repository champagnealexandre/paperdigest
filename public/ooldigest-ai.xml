<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nipah virus (NiV) represents a catastrophic public health risk to the Indian subcontinent, as evidenced by recurring outbreaks in Kerala (2018, 2021, 2023) where case fatality rates reached as high as 70-90%. There are currently no clinically approved therapeutics or vaccines specifically for NiV. A major hurdle in the drug development pipeline is the high mutation rate of RNA viruses, which allows them to rapidly evolve resistance against site-specific inhibitors. This research project utilizes a multi-layered computational strategy to identify a small-molecule inhibitor capable of targeting the viral polymerase while maintaining efficacy against the predicted high-probability W730A resistance mutation. Through a first-principles assessment of the viral polymerase structure (PDB: 9KNZ), I established a design constraint called Allosteric Independence. This requires any lead candidate to bind in a pocket that is geometrically distinct from the mutation site W730, thereby preventing steric or electronic disruption upon mutation. After screening a library of 50 high-potential candidates using a rigid-receptor docking protocol, I identified BMS-986205 (Linrodostat), an investigational IDO1 inhibitor, as a superior lead. BMS-986205 demonstrated a binding affinity of -7.17 kcal/mol against the wild-type polymerase and a paradoxical increase to -7.29 kcal/mol against the W730A mutant. Geometric analysis confirmed a physical separation of 6.28 Å from the mutation site. Given its current status in global Phase 3 clinical trials for oncology, BMS-986205 is a primary candidate for rapid drug repurposing to secure India’s population against future outbreaks.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces an integer-grid coordinate scheme (MINT32) that greatly reduces energy drift and improves long-timescale stability in GPU molecular dynamics, a broadly enabling advance for high-precision simulations (including water and biomolecular systems) but not directly focused on origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Molecular dynamics simulations on GPUs have historically required a trade-off between performance and numerical precision. Mixed-precision approaches, such as AMBER SPFP and OpenMM, accumulate forces in high precision while representing coordinates in single precision (FP32). This design introduces a fundamental “noise floor”: quantization error in FP32 coordinates injects artificial heat into the system, degrading long-term stability and distorting kinetic properties. We introduce MINT32, a coordinate representation that maps the simulation box onto a 32-bit integer grid. MINT32 achieves a spatial resolution of approximately 0.01 fm, roughly 300 times finer than FP32, without the memory bandwidth penalties associated with 64-bit integer arithmetic. In addition, MINT32 offers algorithmic elegance through self-wrapping, whereby periodic boundary conditions are enforced via exact integer overflow, eliminating branch divergence entirely. Benchmark results demonstrate that MINT32 reduces energy drift in microcanonical (NVE) simulations by nearly an order of magnitude (7--10x), delivering double-precision-level stability for challenging PME water systems. When paired with single-precision force evaluations, MINT32 outperforms conventional mixed-precision models, indicating that coordinate precision is the dominant factor governing simulation stability in the systems examined. The fixed-point grid further enables constraint solvers (SHAKE) to converge to tolerances of 10A, effectively eliminating constraint instabilities. Our implementation achieves approximately 85\% of production throughput on consumer-grade GPUs, serving as a conceptual foundation for future molecular dynamics (MD) engines. The primary objective of this study is to identify an optimal coordinate representation for next-generation MD software. To this end, we present a prototype framework designed to isolate and evaluate the numerical behavior of coordinate representations in molecular dynamics, with a modified version of the AMBER simulation package serving solely as a testbed.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chiral non-benzenoid nanographenes remain highly appealing but underexplored synthetic targets due to the lack of feasible synthetic strategies to simultaneously construct non-hexagonal rings and stable chirality. Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of a novel chiral saddle-shaped nanographene (cSNG) incorporating two heptagon-embedded [4]helicenes. The structure of cSNG is unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, demonstrating its flexible π-skeleton. Due to the heptagon-embedded [4]helicene subunits, cSNG exists as configurationally stable enantiomers, which enable chiral resolution and lead to pronounced chiroptical responses. Remarkably, the chiral saddle-shaped framework presents strong host–guest interactions with fullerenes C60 and C70, which were investigated via several titration methods. The association constants for a 1:1 complex, determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy titration (Ka(C60) = 2.3 × 104 M-1; Ka(C70) = 8.7 × 104 M-1), are among the highest values reported for negatively curved nanographenes. Moreover, crystallographic analysis of cocrystals of cSNG with C60 revealed a 1:3 binding mode for supramolecular complexation, featuring two fullerenes accommodated inside the saddle cavity as well as two shared fullerenes located on each concave outward facing side.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Molecular mechanisms governing initiation steps of the assembly of thousands of endogenous multi-protein complexes (EMCs) remain incompletely understood. Here, multiple lines of observations are reported reflecting the biological functions-aligned initiation sequence of hybrid assembly pathways (HAPs) of EMCs. HAPs postulate the creation of cell type-specific intracellular pools of hetero- and homodimers as the first step of chain reactions of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of EMCs’ assemblies. The consensus action sequence of HAPs consists of: a) Initiation on genomic DNA templates of the formation of metastable hetero- and homodimers of EMCs’ protein constituents; b) Release of dimers from DNA templates for delivery to the EMCs assembly compartments; c) Assembly of defined EMCs by sequential on demand addition to preformed dimers serving as attractors of EMC-specific monomers’ ensembles. Chromosome-naïve scaffolds of PPIs contributing to creation of intracellular dimer pools constitute genome-wide networks of binding sites for 716 transcription factors (TFs), 534 of which manifest patterns of significantly enriched expression in 1358 brain regions. The initiators’ loci of HAPs appear to operate within nucleosome-depleted islands of transposable elements (TE) – derived sequences within transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. Performance of PPI DNA template-guided assembly lines of EMCs is illustrated in two concurrent modes of PPI cascades: TF-TF PPI chains and TF-PPI Hub protein chains. Regardless of the number of DNA-bound TFs initiating the multistep PPI sequences at PPI initiators (ranging from one to 716 TFs), both modes of operations reached the equilibrium at the PPI constituents saturation levels of ~245 proteins for TF-TF PPI and of ~351 proteins for TF-PPI Hub Proteins’ assembly chains. Regardless of TF panels bound at HAP initiators, proteins of PPI-guided ensembles are enriched in either defined sets of neuroanatomical structures (TF-TF PPI path) or among structural-functional constituents of synapses (PPI Hub proteins path). Examples of default operation modes of DNA-template-guided assemblies of hetero- and homodimers of Yamanaka factors, neurogenesis constituents, and principal protein components of postsynaptic density of excitatory and inhibitory synaptogenesis are reported. Altogether, this contribution reports the foundational evidence for further experimental and theoretical explorations of retrotransposon-seeded genome-wide codes for initiators of PPI chain reactions of protein dimerization creating pools of attractors to guide and accelerate the EMC assemblies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a nonionic and highly water-soluble polymer, and PEGylation is widely used as a versatile chemical strategy to enhance the water solubility of otherwise poorly soluble molecules. The rational design of PEG-appended materials, therefore, requires an estimation of the PEG chain length necessary to achieve the desired level of solubility. Here, we investigated the relationship between the PEG chain length and the water solubility of PEG-appended molecules using a combination of experimental and computational approaches. We focused on monodisperse PEG with a discrete molecular weight, which enables us to identify the relationship between chain length and physicochemical properties, as represented by water solubility. Then, we designed a series of PEG‑appended molecules bearing monodisperse PEG chains of varying lengths, and measured their water solubilities experimentally. In parallel, molecular dynamics-based alchemical free‑energy calculations yielded thermodynamic trends that reproduced the observed dependence of solubility on PEG chain length. Comparison of experimental and computational results showed that the calculations not only distinguished between water-soluble and insoluble PEG-appended molecules but also captured the solubility trends for moderately soluble species. These findings demonstrate the potential of molecular-dynamics-based free-energy calculations for a priori prediction of the water solubility of PEG-appended molecules.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> G-quadruplex (G4) structures within oncogene promoters represent promising therapeutic targets, particularly in the context of transcriptional regulation. Here, we report that the Red box, a fully organic macrocyclic cationic receptor, exhibits high-affinity and selectivity for G4 structures. Biophysical analyses reveal that the Red box binds the c-MYC G4 with nanomolar affinity, stronger than most reported c-MYC ligands. Notably, the Red box displays greater selectivity for c-MYC over duplex DNA compared to the well-characterized porphyrin TMPyP4 and its macrocyclic architecture is essential for this activity, as its acyclic analogue displays negligible G4 stabilization. In cellular assays, treatment with non-cytotoxic concentrations of the Red box selectively downregulated c-MYC expression in HEK293T cells, with minimal effects on c-KIT and hTERT. Furthermore, c-MYC suppression was proportional to its basal expression across several cell lines, supporting a G4-mediated mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Successive maturation of ribosomal subunits occurs through multi-layered phase-separated structures of the cell nucleolus. The spatio-functional relationship between transcription of rRNA and nucleolar substructures and how this adapts to cellular stress remain incompletely understood. In this study, we resolve the sub nucleolar structures using expansion microscopy to reveal ordered structures of fibrillar center (FC) and dense fibrillar component (DFC) domains as nested shells, which is reorganized upon cellular stress like DNA damage or RNA polymerase I (RNAPI) inhibition. Direct visualization of nascent (5&#x27; ETS) and mature (28S) rRNA suggested that rRNA synthesis is the critical regulator of nucleolar size, and organization. Nucleolar reorganization upon stress emerges to be a direct function of nascent rRNA levels. Stress-induced transcription inhibition remodels the sub-nucleolar compartments from a viscoelastic state into solid-like condensates thereby perturbing the nucleolar pH gradient due to the missing rRNA scaffold. We show, that rather than signalling to mediate rDNA repair, nucleolar reorganization naturally arises primarily from reduced rRNA levels and the resultant biophysical restructuring of the nucleolus under cellular stress.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Unraveling the kinetics of transcriptional regulation is a central challenge in molecular biology. Traditional inference methods based on cell-to-cell mRNA variability are limited because mRNA levels reflect not only transcriptional activity but also post-transcriptional processes. Recent advances in quantifying nascent RNAs across isogenic cells provide a more direct readout of transcriptional dynamics. Here, we present a moments-based theoretical framework that leverages nascent RNA data to infer transcriptional kinetics. We derive closed-form expressions for the first two time-dependent moments of nascent RNA across three canonical transcription models and demonstrate that nascent RNA exhibits distinct transient overshoots and higher Fano factors compared to mature mRNA. Through analysis of synthetic datasets, we show that these features enable more accurate estimation of transcriptional kinetics and allow reliable model selection, distinguishing single from multi-pathway promoter activation with over 75% accuracy even from small sample sizes. We further validated our model selection method using real experimental transcription datasets in yeast and E. coli cells, with nascent RNA demonstrating superior performance in identifying cross-talk pathway regulation. Our framework thus offers a computationally efficient and mechanistically informative approach for decoding transcriptional dynamics, emphasizing the advantages of time-dependent nascent RNA measurements over mature mRNA in capturing the true kinetics of transcriptional regulation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In recent decades, scientists have debated whether a seven-million-year-old fossil was bipedal—a trait that would make it the oldest human ancestor. A new analysis by a team of anthropologists offers powerful evidence that Sahelanthropus tchadensis—a species discovered in the early 2000s—was indeed bipedal by uncovering a feature found only in bipedal hominins.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Antarctic icefish are famous for living without red blood cells, but they are not alone. A species of needle-shaped, warm-water fish called the Asian noodlefish also lacks hemoglobin and red blood cells. Like icefish, its veins are filled with translucent white blood, said H. William Detrich, professor emeritus of marine and environmental sciences, who collaborated with Chinese scientists on a paper about the strange aquatic creatures published in Current Biology.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Angiosperms, also known as flowering plants, represent the most diverse group of seed plants, and their origin and evolution have long been a central question in plant evolutionary biology. Whole-genome duplication (WGD), or polyploidization, is widely recognized as a key driver of the origin and trait evolution of both seed plants and angiosperms.</p>
