<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This preprint reports that native Ni0 in water can drive multiple prebiotic, protein-free redox transformations (including 2-oxo acid reduction to 2-hydroxy acids/amino acids and fumarate reduction) at 25–100°C without added H2, expanding plausible early metabolic-like chemistry linked to the acetyl-CoA pathway.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Compared to iron, nickel is comparatively rare as a transition metal in enzymes. But it is essential in several enzymes of carbon and energy metabolism in acetogens (bacteria) and methanogens (archaea), which use the acetyl-CoA pathway of H2-dependent CO2 fixation. Nickel containing enzymes of acetogens and methanogens include FeNi hydrogenase, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, acetyl-CoA synthase and, in methanogens, methyl-CoM reductase in the last step of methane synthesis. Several lines of evidence implicate the acetyl-CoA pathway as the most ancient pathway of CO2 fixation, most notably recent findings that the overall reaction of the enzymatic pathway from H2 (E0&#x27; = -414 mV) and CO2 to pyruvate can be replaced by Ni0 alone in water as the lone catalyst. Here we studied the ability of Ni0 to serve as catalyst and reductant for nonenzymatic redox reactions that require only a mild reductant, as the midpoint potential of Ni0 oxidation to Ni2+ is E0&#x27; = -260 mV. We show that Ni0 in water can convert 2-oxo acids to 2-hydroxy acids and, in the presence of NH3, to amino acids at 25-100C without addition of H2, and that it will function as catalyst and reductant for the fumarate reductase reaction. The findings expand the repertoire of ancient metabolic reactions that Ni0 can catalyze without proteins, cofactors, or sulfur, shedding light on the broad catalytic activity and substrate specificity of Ni0 at metabolic origin.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Presents an MRI-based 3D+time imaging and atlas pipeline to non-destructively quantify early fungal-driven wood degradation in grapevines, with minimal relevance to origins-of-life questions aside from general water-status phenotyping.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In perennial crops, inner wood degradation often escapes detection until irreversible damage has occurred. Grapevine trunk disease (GTD) is a well-known example in viticulture that alters plants from within, years before foliar symptoms arise, making early assessment difficult. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel non-destructive 3D + t pipeline for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) spatial quantification and monitoring of early internal tissue degradation resulting from fungal colonization. This pipeline integrates (i) anatomical alignment and rigid time-series registration of volumetric MRI scans, (ii) a generalized cylindrical coordinate transformation for cross-sectional trunk anatomy normalization, (iii) supervised classification to segment water-depleted (diseased/non-functional) regions, and (iv) population-level statistical analyses including construction of population mean images, probabilistic atlases of lesions, and 3D lesion descriptors. Applied to multiple Vitis vinifera cultivars inoculated with a fungal trunk pathogen, our approach enables time-lapse comparisons of cultivar and treatment in vivo. The results reveal consistent early degradation signals across individuals and cultivar-dependent lesion differences. By combining high-resolution MRI with advanced image processing and statistical atlas tools, this method provides a new paradigm for 3D plant phenotyping of internal disease progression. This methodological innovation allows non-invasive quantification of disease development and comparative assessment of host responses in woody plants, demonstrating its potential to advance understanding and management of GTDs.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Reports an antisense-RNA knockdown mutational strategy in the intracellular bacterium Ehrlichia chaffeensis to reduce expression of an essential outer membrane protein, offering a genetic tool but with minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Obligate intracellular pathogenic bacteria belonging to the order Rickettsiales include several important emerging pathogens causing major health and economic impact to people, companion animals, and agricultural animals. Despite some recent progress, the lack of well-established genetic manipulation methods for diverse research applications remains a challenge. We recently reported the establishment of targeted mutagenesis methods to disrupt genes in Ehrlichia and Anaplasma species. Many essential genes in Ehrlichia chaffeensis are likely refractory to targeted mutagenesis, thus we developed a novel targeted mutational approach leading to the expression of antisense RNA to facilitate the knockdown of p28-Omp19 protein expression from ECH_1143. This gene was selected as its encoded protein is among the highly immunogenic proteins of E. chaffeensis and is likely essential for the pathogen. This method involved introducing a mutation at a distal genomic location within the E. chaffeensis genome to allow for generation of a 209 nucleotide-long antisense RNA segment complementary to ECH_1143 coding mRNA from the same gene promoter which was duplicated as part of the mutagenesis. The mutational strategy was designed to retain the surrounding genomic regions unaltered. The antisense knockdown version of E. chaffeensis resulted in a reduction of p28-Omp19 expression when compared to wild-type E. chaffeensis during its replication in a macrophage cell line, where the gene expression is known to occur. We anticipate that the antisense mutational strategy will be broadly applicable to facilitate investigating essential genes of obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This preprint reports crystal structures and biophysical mechanisms behind the unusually high ATPase activity and dimerization of the plant chloroplast HSP90C chaperone, informing chloroplast protein import but with only tangential relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chloroplasts are the main energy organelles in plants, primary through photosynthesis. Thereby, they are responsible for CO2 fixation and dioxygen production, which are essential for living species on Earth. To ensure these processes, numerous proteins encoded from the nuclear DNA need to be imported inside the chloroplast, and eventually to the thylakoids. Whereas the translocation systems from both chloroplastic and thylakoids membranes have been studied in recent years, the stromal route between these two membranes is largely unknown. Notably, the chloroplastic HSP90 (HSP90C) is likely to play an important role in this process, but its structure and molecular mechanisms remain to be unveiled. In this study, we used a combination of structural and biophysical approaches to elucidate the features of Arabidopsis thaliana&#x27;s HSP90C. Principally, we found that HSP90C has a remarkably high ATPase activity among the HSP90 family proteins. Further investigation allowed us to pinpoint atypical mechanisms responsible for this high activity. First, the N-terminal cap is involved in a disulfide bond that accelerates the ATPase activity of HSP90C. Second, its C-terminal domain features an extension that is mandatory for its dimerization. Third, our crystal structures reveal a wide opening of the HSP90C&#x27;s dimer with reduced intermonomeric interfaces. Lastly, we identified a helical switch which is required for HSP90C&#x27;s high activity. Three of these four features are due to sequence signatures of HSP90C, which we found to be shared by most of green plants representatives. Our study provides first insights of HSP90C&#x27;s non-canonical mechanisms, which will help in the understanding of processes related to protein import in the chloroplast.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Adaptive evolution in Mycobacteria under ethidium bromide selection reveals a hard ceiling on efflux-mediated drug resistance driven by regulatory changes and conserved metabolic rewiring, but it has limited direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Multidrug-resistant efflux pumps play a critical role in antimicrobial resistance, yet the physiological limits of their overexpression remain poorly understood. While gene amplifications and regulatory mutations commonly drive this overexpression, these pumps remain transcriptionally inactive under normal cellular conditions due to their high energetic cost, making it challenging to assess their full impact on resistance evolution and the maximum attainable minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). To delineate the extent and spectrum of efflux-based resistance, we subjected Mycobacterium smegmatis mc{superscript 2}155(Msm) wild-type and efflux pump-deleted strains ({Delta}lfrA and {Delta}efpA) to adaptive laboratory evolution in the presence of a broad-spectrum efflux substrate ethidium bromide (EtBr). Despite prolonged selection, resistance plateaued at 8-16x MIC, revealing an intrinsic ceiling to efflux-based adaptation. Evolved populations integrated multiple layers of adaptation: enhanced efflux kinetics, reduced intracellular EtBr accumulation, and mutations spanning global regulators, ribosomal genes, and membrane components. Notably, deletion of specific pumps ({Delta}lfrA) triggered compensatory upregulation of alternative efflux systems, highlighting functional redundancy. Beyond efflux activation, evolved strains exhibited metabolic reprogramming, including downregulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and upregulation of lipid biosynthesis and {beta}-oxidation, which altered NAD+/NADH homeostasis and membrane potential. Extending this adaptive evolution approach to Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra (Mtb)demonstrated that these adaptive constraints and metabolic alterations are conserved across mycobacterial species. Together, these results uncover fundamental limits to efflux evolution and reveal how bacteria integrate regulatory and metabolic plasticity to maximize drug resistance. Targeting these interconnected networks may offer a powerful strategy to contain the rise of multidrug resistance.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Develops a Poisson–hypergeometric theoretical framework and a microfluidic-free droplet digital immunoassay enabling calibration-curve-free absolute protein quantification, a methodological advance with only indirect potential relevance to astrobiological biosignature detection.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Current single-molecule immunoassays primarily rely on Poisson distribution models, which have limitations in achieving absolute quantification of target proteins. To address this, we developed a novel mathematical model that treats the capture of target proteins by magnetic beads as a discrete Poisson process, while the subsequent washing and secondary sampling steps are modeled using a hypergeometric distribution. Based on this combined distribution model, we constructed a new theoretical framework for digital immunoassays and proposed a calibration‑curve‑free absolute quantification method based on micro‑volume calculation. To validate the feasibility of this model, we established a digital immunoassay platform using a water‑in‑oil magnetic bead system without the need for complex microfluidic devices. This approach not only eliminates reliance on traditional calibration curves but also demonstrates enhanced feasibility and a broader dynamic range compared to existing methods such as Single Molecule Immunoassays and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassays. Additionally, it allows for the determination of the binding efficiency and accurate blank coefficients of the detection system. Furthermore, the potential application of an internal calibration method within this system is explored. The proposed theoretical framework offers a new strategy to address the challenge of absolute quantification in protein immunoassays, provides important insights for advancing protein quantification methodologies, and supports the development of more precise detection techniques. It is expected to expand the application of digital immunoassays in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Trypanosomatid parasites cause diverse diseases in humans and their livestock, but share a unique biological feature, the organization of mitochondrial DNA into a complex structure, named kinetoplast (kDNA), which is crucial for the survival of the parasites. Replication, segregation and expression of kDNA are highly complex processes that involve an estimated ~300 proteins, only a fraction of which have been identified and characterized. Here, we report the development of an unbiased genetic screen in the experimental model Trypanosoma brucei to identify novel factors involved in kDNA maintenance. Our approach uses a combination of genome-wide RNA interference, a novel kDNA staining protocol, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Of the 20 highest-ranked genes identified, six are known kDNA maintenance factors. One hit, Tb927.8.4240, a gene of previously unknown function, was selected for experimental validation and follow-up. Ultrastructure expansion microscopy using a tagged version of the protein reveals a dynamic localization during the cell cycle. RNAi-mediated ablation of Tb927.8.4240 results in the progressive but incomplete loss of kDNA, with only a minor effect on the tripartite attachment complex, suggesting the protein is involved in kDNA replication but not segregation. The growth phenotype of Tb927.8.4240 ablation is fully rescued in a kDNA-independent genetic background, confirming a specific role in kDNA replication.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Cryo-EM and biochemical work reveals how the eukaryotic chromatin remodeler ATRX deforms and unwraps nucleosomal DNA via a unique phenylalanine “pin” and additional anchoring elements to drive nucleosome sliding.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked protein (ATRX) is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler that performs diverse functions, including spacing nucleosomes, facilitating the deposition of histone variant H3.3, and preventing replication stress. The mechanism by which ATRX modulates chromatin is unknown. Here, our cryo-EM structure revealed that ATRX recognizes and modulates the nucleosome through its C-terminal regions by embracing and unwrapping ~18 base-pair nucleosomal DNA near the entry/exit sites in the presence of ADP-BeF3. Strikingly, the DNA minor groove between SHL6 and SHL7 is profoundly deformed by a pin-like structure in ATRX, which uniquely intercalates the aromatic side chain of a phenylalanine into the base stackings. Biochemical assays revealed the crucial role of this phenylalanine in sliding the nucleosome without affecting the ATPase activity. Such a pin-like structure mimics a foot-step on the DNA ladder, which differentiates ATRX from other remodelers. To translocate the DNA on the nucleosome, two more features, including a disordered insertion that contacts the histone surface and a positively charged loop bridging the cross-gyre interactions, serve as essential anchors for the nucleosome modulation by ATRX. Together, we propose a climbing model for how ATRX mobilizes the DNA upon ATP hydrolysis.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Error</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Light-driven hydrogen evolution is a promising strategy for solar fuel production. While numerous systems for molecular photocatalysis exist, their implementation into reusable soft materials remains challenging due to catalyst leaching, solubility issues, and limited structural integration. Here, we report the first hydrogel system in which a molecular photocatalyst is covalently embedded as crosslinker. Using a bipyridine- annulated perylene dye bearing terminal alkene groups, we employ thiol-ene click chemistry to incorporate the dye into a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based hydrogel network. Post-synthetic platinum coordination yields “Dyedrogels” – mechanically robust hydrogels of varying shape that retain their photocatalytic functionality under visible-light irradiation in pure water, without any solubilizing additives. Structural and optical characterization confirms a homogeneous distribution of the catalyst, while indicating only negligible platinum leaching. Despite moderate hydrogen evolution turnover numbers (TON = 0.03), the stability, modularity, and reusability of this platform underscore its value as a device-like material for future flow-reactor designs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a photocatalytically active hydrogel in which the molecular catalyst itself constitutes a covalent crosslink within the polymer network.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Biomedical materials study using rheology and physics-informed machine learning to predict how shear history tunes hydrogel gelation and viscoelasticity in a lung-mimetic sealant, with minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Hydrogel-based lung sealants are optimized largely based on formulation and post-cure mechanics, even though deformation history during delivery and placement plays a critical, yet under-characterized, role in determining in situ performance. This disconnect is particularly consequential on the application of lung sealants, where excessive stiffness promotes delamination while insufficient stiffness compromises airtight sealing. Here, we establish a quantitative process–structure–property framework for a gelatin–tannic acid–transglutaminase lung-mimetic sealant by integrating time-resolved rheology with physics-informed machine learning. Using small-amplitude oscillatory shear and steady torsional flow at 37 °C, we show that gelation follows a reproducible kinetic clock (storage modulus, G′– loss modulus, G″, crossover at ~100 s; modulus plateau by ~600 s), while the attainable viscoelastic state is strongly governed by deformation history. Increasing oscillatory strain amplitude from 0.1 % to 50 % suppresses network maturation, reducing the post-gelation storage modulus, G′, from ~10⁶ to ~10⁴ Pa, whereas sustained steady shear (0.01–1 s⁻¹) decreases magnitude of complex viscosity by 2–3 orders of magnitude and permanently downshifts elastic moduli, G′–, from ≈3.5×10³ to ≈4×10² Pa. These modulus ranges span the effective compliance of lung parenchyma under physiological tidal strain, delineating mechanical regimes associated with airtight sealing, strain accommodation, or premature interfacial failure. Controlled aeration during the processing of the sealant further decreases stiffness by ~30 % without altering gelation kinetics, providing an additional, physically interpretable compliance-tuning mechanism. To unify these effects, we introduce a dimensionless Degree of Gelation (DoG), serving as a rheological state variable that collapses oscillatory and steady-shear histories into a single, time-resolved descriptor of network evolution. Machine-learning models trained on experimentally accessible inputs (time, strain amplitude, shear rate, frequency, aeration) accurately predict DoG (R² ≈ 0.9) and, in inverse mode, identify handling conditions required to achieve targeted in situ mechanical states. This rheology–machine-learning framework reframes lung sealant development from a static materials optimization problem to a controllable, process-driven design strategy. By quantitatively linking applicator-level parameters to failure-relevant mechanical outcomes—airtightness, compliance, and resistance to delamination—it provides a mechanistic and generalizable foundation for the design of injectable hydrogels, bioadhesives, and tissue-interfacing</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We report a novel CO2 capture and separation principle based on the unexpected formation of CO2-loaded amine hydrates. Unlike conventional amine scrubbing, which relies on energy-intensive thermal regeneration, our approach utilizes a phase change driven by cooling. We discovered that various bifunctional amines, upon capturing CO2 in aqueous solutions containing tetrahydrofuran (THF), are structurally incorporated into the hydrate crystal lattice. This phenomenon was unequivocally confirmed via solid-state NMR and FTIR spectroscopy, with some hydrates exhibiting a distinct blue coloration. This phase separation facilitates partial dehydration and the partitioning of CO2-loaded amines into the solid phase, effectively reducing the working solution’s heat capacity. Scalability was successfully demonstrated in a 150-mL system under ambient pressure. These findings establish a new regime in amine-CO2-water chemistry, offering a “cooling-based” fractionation strategy to significantly lower the energy penalty of carbon capture processes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Aromatic rings are widely recognized in the realm of natural products and bioactive molecules, highlighting their importance in various applications. The development of deuterated analogues of pharmaceuticals is particularly significant in pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. In this study, we present a novel catalytic method for hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange in aromatic compounds, employing D2O as the deuterium source, which is not only easily accessible but also cost-effective. This approach demonstrates impressive deuterium incorporation under mild reaction conditions, yielding good to excellent results in a single run. Utilizing para-toluenesulfonic acid (pTSA) as a catalyst, this metal-free protocol exhibits broad applicability in the late-stage deuteration of a variety of bioactive molecules, pharmaceuticals, and small molecules. Furthermore, our method is scalable; it has been successfully implemented at the gram-scale with a reduced catalyst loading of 2.0 mol% for Tyrosol, illustrating its practical utility. Moreover, our thorough mechanistic studies and detailed DFT studies enhance our understanding of how the catalyst and solvent contribute to the aromatic electrophilic substitution process. This innovative method provides a sustainable alternative to traditional transition metal-catalyzed H/D exchange techniques. It addresses key challenges such as the use of expensive metals, the risk of undesired reactions, and the need to remove metal impurities from products.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recognition of foreign molecules inside cells is critical for immunity in all domains of life. Proteins of the STAND NTPase superfamily, including eukaryotic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), play a central role in this process. In bacteria and archaea, although several STAND NTPase families have been reported to sense phage proteins, their functional diversity remains largely unexplored. Here, we conducted a systematic phylogenetic analysis of prokaryotic STAND NTPases and identified at least 90 structurally distinct families associated with antiviral defense. We first show that the uncharacterized Avs7 family recognizes the major capsid protein (MCP) of tailed phages. Three cryo-EM structures of Salmonella enterica Avs7 reveal an asymmetric, butterfly-shaped tetramer that assembles stepwise via large, MCP-induced conformational changes, incorporating bacterial translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) as a scaffold that is required for full defense activity. Using highly parallel genetic screens, we further show that 13 additional STAND families sense 12 conserved phage protein folds, encompassing most of the core structural and replicative components of tailed phages. These include two structurally distinct families--Avs8 (PD-{lambda}-4) and Avs10 (Erebus/Hypnos/bNACHT64)--that also recognize MCP, as well as 11 other families (Avs11-21) that recognize the portal, portal adaptor, tail nozzle, head-tail connector, tail terminator, tail tube protein, tail assembly chaperone, tape measure protein, DNA polymerase, helicase/RecA-type ATPase, and single-stranded DNA annealing protein (SSAP), respectively. Together, our findings highlight structure-based pattern recognition and host factor repurposing as fundamental strategies of bacterial immunity.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Given that Mexico is one of the world&#x27;s leading consumers of bottled water per capita, this study provides the first evidence of microplastic contamination across ten widely consumed commercial brands in the country. A total of 2,358 MP particles were detected with an average concentration of 39.3 ± 14.6 particles/L. Statistical analysis (ANOVA, p = 0.0008) confirmed significant differences in MP levels between brands, likely attributed to variations in the production process and packaging quality. Fibers were the predominant shape of the detected MPs (72.2 %), and transparent particles were the most frequent color (57.7 %). Crucially, most detected MPs were smaller than 500 µm (80.3 %), raising toxicological concerns due to the high probability of systemic translocation in human tissues. Furthermore, FTIR spectroscopy confirmed that PET (66 %) and PP (18 %) were the dominant polymers, indicating that fragmentation and abrasion of the bottle and caps are the primary sources of MPs. The estimated intake assessment revealed that children are the most vulnerable population segment (228.2 particles/kg/year), exhibiting the highest relative MP dose normalized by body weight. Given the global evidence of adverse health effects from these polymers and their leached chemical additives, these findings underscore the urgent need to implement effective strategies to minimize MP exposure in bottled water.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pyridinium compounds are promising electrolyte candidates for aqueous flow batteries yet undergo complex parasitic processes involving free radical species that remain difficult to monitor, track and regulate. Inspired by biological redox signaling, we developed operando pH monitoring to accurately track native pyridinium electrolyte processes across nine orders of magnitude (i.e., pH 3 – 12), elucidating trace (nanomolar) state-of-charge-dependent equilibria that can be used for continuous monitoring of state of charge and health in materials that do not feature a principal proton coupled redox process. By monitoring pH, we gain simultaneous real-time insights into direct and mediated water splitting, direct and mediated dioxygen reduction, oxidation-statedependent pyridinium pKa effects, and trans-membrane OH– transport. These insights inform the development of a global regulation strategy, based on a single radical dependent dimensionless parameter, towards complete suppression of parasitic processes under practical battery cycling conditions. We also clarify the nature of the reaction between dioxygen and reduced viologen towards improved system engineering for long duration energy storage applications.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Due to their low manufacturing cost and versatility in delivering diverse nucleic acid payloads such as plasmids (pDNA) and genome editor proteins, polymers have emerged as promising vectors in gene therapy. To encapsulate and deliver anionic nucleic acids, researchers add cationic polymers to payloads (e.g., pDNA), forming highly fragile, complex, and heterogeneous polyplex assemblies. Large stoichiometric excesses of protonotable amine groups (in the polymers) over the phosphate groups (in the pDNA) are typical of polyplexes, which are frequently formed at nitrogen-to phosphorous ratios between 5–100 . Rather than binding irreversibly to pDNA payloads, polymers predominantly exist as “free polymers” which dynamically exchange with pDNA-bound polymers. Analogous to empty lipid nanoparticles and empty viral capsids, free polymers pose complex characterization, quality control, and regulatory challenges that may hinder clinical translation. We urgently need to quantify how free polymers modify critical polyplex properties (e.g., pDNA loading per polyplex) as well as biological outcomes (e.g., immunogenicity, pDNA delivery efficiency, and toxicity). We developed a unique analytical approach that unveils hitherto unsuspected roles played by free polymers during the complexation and intracellular delivery of pDNA. Applying asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4), we gently separated free polymers from crude polyplexes while conserving polyplex integrity. Unlike batch light scattering analysis of fractionated crude polyplexes, which severely underestimate polyplex size and pDNA loading per polyplex, AF4 sharpened measurements of polyplex molecular weight, pDNA loading, and radius of gyration by removing free polymers and their background scattering contributions. Comparing solution properties via light scattering, we discovered that AF4-purified polyplexes appeared over twice as large, loading twice as much pDNA as crude polyplexes. AF4 uncovered contrasts in the biological performance of crude and purified polyplexes. Free polymers aggravated inflammatory responses in macrophages by up to 22%. Removing free polymers depressed transfection efficiency by 50% while improving cell viability by 30%; reintroducing free polymers abrogated these contrasts. By separating and quantifying free polymers in polyplexes, AF4 illuminated a far more complex portrait of polyplex solution properties that has hitherto remained elusive to conventional characterization methods. Our work has revealed pathways to ameliorate polymer-associated toxicity and inflammation during pDNA delivery.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> New research shows Karnak Temple was built on a rare island of high ground formed as Nile river channels shifted thousands of years ago. Before that, the area was too flooded for settlement, making the temple’s eventual rise even more remarkable. The landscape closely mirrors ancient Egyptian creation myths, where sacred land emerges from water. This suggests Karnak’s location was chosen not just for practicality, but for its deep symbolic power.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Enterotoxins cause severe diseases worldwide, exacerbated by limited access to clean water, food, and medical care. Cholera is a diarrheal disease driven by cholera enterotoxin (CTX) and is secreted by Vibrio cholerae in the small intestinal (SI) epithelium. CTX consists of an enzymatic A subunit (CTA) and a pentameric B subunit (CTB), which mediates cellular uptake by binding to glycans. While CTB primarily recognizes GM1 glycosphingolipid or galactose ligands, GM1 is undetectable in the human SI, and fucose ligands are a key alternative binding target. Previously, we developed linear norbornenyl glycopolymers as biomimetic inhibitors that block CTB binding through interchain crosslinking, forming CTB-glycopolymer aggregates. To assess the polymers’ potential efficacy under flow conditions, we evaluated CTB-glycopolymer binding kinetics under dynamic conditions using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Copolymer with a random display of galactose and fucose (pGal50Fuc50) showed nanomolar avidity with stable complex formation driven primarily by a slow dissociation rate in the multivalent phase (kd1). In contrast, an equimolar mixture of homopolymers (pGal100 + pFuc100) exhibited similar binding avidity and comparable inhibitory efficacy but did not display slow-dissociation. Moreover, random copolymer pGal25Fuc75 dissociated slowly even from low-CTB-density surfaces. These results highlight the superior stability of copolymers in forming CTB–copolymer aggregates under low CTB abundance and flow conditions. These findings underscore the importance of co-displaying galactose and fucose for complex formation and for developing clinically-useful therapies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The poor solubility and dispersibility of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in aqueous media remain critical limitations for their practical application because conventional oxidative treatments typically require harsh conditions that degrade the nanotube structure. Here, we report a simple and scalable method for dispersing SWCNTs in water via chlorine dioxide (ClO₂•)-mediated oxidation under ambient conditions. The treatment selectively introduced oxygenated functionalities—including hydroxy, carbonyl, and carboxy groups—onto the CNT surface while preserving the tubular framework, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The resulting dispersions exhibited long-term colloidal stability without the need for surfactants, supported by a strongly negative ζ potential (−41.6 mV). Importantly, electronic conductivity was largely maintained: the resistivity of oxidized CNT films was only threefold higher than that of sodium cholate–dispersed CNTs (0.045 vs 0.016 Ω·cm at 25 °C), with &lt;10% variation between 25 and 50 °C. This unique balance between enhanced aqueous dispersibility and preserved charge transport underscores ClO₂• oxidation as a green and effective strategy for producing water-processable CNTs, showing promise for applications in pharmaceutical drugs, printable electronics, functional composites, energy storage, and sensing.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00354v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) are filamentary moisture pathways responsible for a large fraction of extreme precipitation and often occur as interacting filament bundles within the same synoptic regime. Existing diagnostics typically analyze ARs in isolation, despite the frequent coexistence and interaction of multiple filaments. We introduce a topological framework for AR analysis based on framed braids and framed braidoids, which encodes both the geometric interaction of AR centroids and the internal evolution of moisture transport. In this approach, AR filaments are represented as strands whose time-ordered crossings form braid words, while moisture-based framing captures internal intensification or weakening along each filament. Applying this framework to reanalysis-derived Atmospheric River track data, we construct braid and framed braid representations over sliding time windows and analyze a strongly interacting multi-filament AR episode in the North Pacific. The results show that braid-based indicators capture structural reorganizations and moisture intensification episodes that are not apparent from centroid geometry or IVT magnitude alone, offering a complementary structural perspective on atmospheric moisture transport.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00062v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We study a periodically driven macrospin system with anisotropic long-range interactions and collective dissipation, described by a Lindblad master equation. In the thermodynamic limit ($N\to\infty$), a mean-field treatment yields classical equations of motion, whose dynamics are characterized via the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE). Focusing on the thermodynamic limit, we map out chaotic, quasiperiodic, and periodic phases via bifurcation diagrams, MLEs, and Fourier spectra of evolved observables, identifying classic period-doubling bifurcations and fractal boundaries in the regions of attractors. Finite-size quantum simulations in the Dicke basis reveal that while both quantum and classical systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases, finite-size effects suppress some behaviors present in the thermodynamic limit. The sign of $\lambda_{\mathrm{max}}$ serves as a key indicator of convergence between quantum and classical dynamics, which agree over timescales up to the Lyapunov time. Analysis of the density matrix shows that convergence occurs only when its nonzero elements are sharply localized. However, the nonconvergence does not imply a fundamental difference between quantum and classical dynamics: in chaotic regimes, although the evolution orbits of quantum and classical systems show significant differences, quantum evolution becomes mixed and diffusively explores the Hilbert space, signaling quantum chaos, which can be confirmed by the delocalized nature of the density matrix.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00262v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We present a series of experiments investigating the local microstructure of cylindrical piles composed of highly concave particles. By systematically varying particle geometry -- from spheres to strongly non-convex polypods -- as well as frictional properties and the number of branches, we explore how these parameters, together with the preparation protocol, shape the internal structure of the system. Using X-ray tomography combined with a dedicated image-analysis pipeline, we accurately extract the position, orientation, and contacts of every particle in each pile. This allows us to quantify the evolution of key structural observables as a function of particle geometry and preparation method. In particular, we measure the distributions of local packing fraction, coordination number, number of neighbors, and contact locations, along with particle-particle positional and orientational correlations. More importantly, we construct a new stability indicator that correlates perfectly with the observed pile stabilities, enabling us to identify the fundamental mechanisms responsible for \textit{geometrically induced cohesion} in granular systems composed of non-interlocking particle shapes: interdigitation, rotational constraint, friction-mediated cohesion, and the ability of a pile to re-stabilize.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00102v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) is a highly effective optimization technique. A primary challenge when applying CMA-ES in high dimensionality is sampling from a multivariate normal distribution with an arbitrary covariance matrix, which involves its decomposition. The cubic complexity of this process is the main obstacle to applying CMA-ES in highdimensional spaces. We introduce a version of CMA-ES that uses no covariance matrix at all. In the proposed matrix-free CMA-ES, an archive stores the vectors of differences between individuals and the midpoint, normalized by the step size. New individuals are generated as the weighted combinations of the vectors from the archive. We prove that the probability distribution of individuals generated by the proposed method is identical to that of the standard CMA-ES. Experimental results show that reducing the archive size to store only a fixed number of the most recent populations is sufficient, without compromising optimization efficiency. The matrix-free and matrix-based CMA-ES achieve comparable results on the quadratic function when the step-size adaptation is turned off. When coupled with the step-size adaptation method, the matrix-free CMA-ES converges faster than the matrix-based, and usually yields the results of a comparable or superior quality, according to the results obtained for the CEC&#x27;2017 benchmark suite. Presented approach simplifies the algorithm, offers a novel perspective on covariance matrix adaptation, and serves as a stepping stone toward even more efficient methods.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00059v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We explore the evolution of sub-Neptune (radii between $\sim$1.5 and 4 R$_\oplus$) exoplanet interior structures using our upgraded planetary evolution code, \texttt{APPLE}, which self-consistently couples the thermal and compositional evolution of the whole structure. We incorporate stably stratified regions with convective mixing and, for the first time, ab initio results on the phase separation of silicate-hydrogen mixtures to model silicate rain in sub-Neptune envelopes. We demonstrate that inefficient mantle cooling can retain sufficient heat to Gyr ages: inefficient heat transport from mantle to envelope alone keeps radii $\sim$10\% larger than predicted by adiabatic models at late times. Silicate rain can contribute an additional $\sim$5\% to the radius, depending on envelope mass and initial metal abundance. The silicate-hydrogen immiscibility region may lie in the middle or even upper envelope, far above the envelope-mantle boundary layer, and bifurcates the envelope into two an upper, hydrogen-rich region and a lower, metal-rich region above the mantle. If silicate rain occurs, atmospheres should appear depleted of silicates while radii remain inflated at late ages. To demonstrate this, we present interior evolution models for GJ 1214 b, K2-18 b, TOI-270 d, and TOI-1801 b, showing that hot, liquid silicate mantles with thin envelopes reproduce their radii and mean densities, providing an alternative to water-world interpretations. These results imply that bulk compositions inferred from mean density must account for mantle thermal state and envelope mixing/phase separation history; such thermal ``memories&#x27;&#x27; may constrain formation entropies and temperatures when metallicities are better measured.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2510.11930v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Mechanical lattices support topological wave phenomena governed by geometric phases. We develop a compact Hilbert space description for one-dimensional elastic chains, expressing intra-cell motion as a normalized superposition of orthogonal eigenstates and tracking complex amplitudes as trajectories on a Bloch sphere. For diatomic lattices, this framework makes inversion symmetry protection explicit: the relative phase between in-phase and out-of-phase modes is piecewise locked, and the Zak phase is quantized with band-dependent jumps at symmetry points. Extending the analysis to triatomic lattices shows that restoring inversion retains quantization, whereas breaking it dequantizes the geometric phase while leaving the spectral origin invariant. Viewing norm-preserving transformations of the modal coefficient pair as Bloch sphere rotations, we demonstrate classical analogues of single-qubit logic gates. A pi-phase rotation about a transverse axis swaps the modal poles, and a longitudinal-axis phase flip maps balanced superpositions to their conjugates. These gate-like operations are realized by controlled evolution across wavenumber space and can be driven or reprogrammed through spatiotemporal stiffness modulation. Introducing space-time modulation hybridizes carrier and sideband harmonics, producing continuous phase winding and open-path geometric phases accumulated along the Floquet trajectory. Across static and modulated regimes, the framework unifies algebraic and geometric viewpoints, remains robust to gauge and basis choices, and operates directly on amplitude-phase data. The results clarify how symmetry, modulation, and topology jointly govern dispersion, modal mixing, and phase accumulation, providing tools to analyze and design vibration and acoustic functionalities in engineered structures.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00440v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Culture is not just traits but a dynamic system of interdependent beliefs, practices and artefacts embedded in cognitive, social and material structures. Culture evolves as these entities interact, generating path dependence, attractor states and tension, with long-term stability punctuated by rapid systemic transformations. Cultural learning and creativity is modelled as coherence-seeking information processing: individuals filter, transform and recombine input in light of prior acquisitions and dissonance reduction, thereby creating increasingly structured worldviews. Higher-order traits such as goals, skills, norms and cognitive gadgets act as emergent metafilters that regulate subsequent selection by defining what counts as coherent. Together, these filtering processes self-organise into epistemic niches, echo chambers, polarised groups and institutions that channel information flows and constrain future evolution. In this view, LLMs and recommender algorithms are products of cultural embeddings that now act back on cultural systems by automated filtering and recombination of information, reshaping future dynamics of cultural systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00640v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: WASP-107~b is an extremely low-density super-puff exoplanet whose inflated radius and evidence of strong internal heating make it a key target for understanding planetary structure and evolution. Its orbital eccentricity is a critical parameter for testing mechanisms such as tidal heating and high-eccentricity migration, yet previous measurements have remained inconclusive. Due to the large radial velocity jitter caused by stellar activity, and the presence of at least one additional planet in the system, previous radial velocity measurements could not robustly determine the eccentricity of WASP-107~b. Here we combine the new JWST secondary eclipse data with transit timing data from HST, TESS, and JWST to measure the eccentricity of WASP-107~b. Our joint analysis shows that WASP-107~b has an eccentricity of $0.09\pm0.02$, a mass of $0.096\pm0.005 \, M_J$, and an orbital period of $5.721487\pm0.000001$~days. We find the $99.7\%$ lower limit of the eccentricity is about 0.04. These new measurements are consistent with the scenario in which WASP-107~b is in the final stage of high-eccentricity migration. Preliminary estimate shows that eccentricity-driven tidal dissipation can provide a significant contribution to the energy required to sustain the observed radius inflation of WASP-107~b. Our results establish the dynamical status of one of the most intriguing low-density exoplanets known, and offer new insights into its formation and evolution history.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00251v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: As wireless networks continue to evolve, stringent latency and reliability requirements and highly dynamic channels expose fundamental limitations of gNB-centric massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) architectures, motivating a rethinking of the user equipment (UE) role. In response, the UE is transitioning from a passive transceiver into an active entity that directly contributes to system-level performance. In this context, this article examines the evolving role of the UE in mMIMO systems during the transition from fifth-generation (5G) to sixth-generation (6G), bridging third generation partnership project (3GPP) standardization, device implementation, and architectural innovation. Through a chronological review of 3GPP Releases 15 to 19, we highlight the progression of UE functionalities from basic channel state information (CSI) reporting to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based CSI enhancement and UE-initiated beam management. We further examine key implementation challenges, including multi-panel UE (MPUE) architectures, on-device intelligent processing, and energy-efficient operation, and then discuss corresponding architectural innovations under practical constraints. Using digital-twin-based evaluations, we validate the impact of emerging UE-centric functionalities, illustrating that UE-initiated beam reporting improves throughput in realistic mobility scenarios, while a multi-panel architecture enhances link robustness compared with a single-panel UE.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00735v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Nielsen&#x27;s geometric approach to quantum circuit complexity provides a Riemannian framework for quantifying the cost of implementing unitary (closed--system) dynamics. For open dynamics, however, the reduced evolution is described by quantum channels and admits many inequivalent Stinespring realizations, so any meaningful complexity notion must specify which microscopic resources are counted as accessible and which transformations are regarded as gauge. We introduce and analyze a geometric complexity functional for families of quantum channels based on unitary dilations. We distinguish an implementation-dependent complexity, defined relative to explicit dilation data, from an intrinsic channel complexity obtained by minimizing over a physically motivated class of admissible dilations (e.g. bounded environment dimension, energy or norm constraints, and penalty structures). The functional has a subtractive form: it compares the geometric cost of the total unitary realization with a canonical surrogate term that removes purely environmental contributions. We justify this subtraction from concise postulates, including closed-system consistency, environment-only neutrality, and invariance under dilation gauge transformations that leave the channel unchanged. This leads to a companion quantity, noise complexity, quantifying the loss of geometric complexity relative to a prescribed ideal closed evolution. We establish a coherence-based lower bound for unitary geometric complexity, derive structural properties such as linear time scaling under time-homogeneous dilations, and obtain dissipator--controlled bounds in the Markovian (GKSL/Lindblad) regime under a standard dilation construction. Finally, we illustrate the framework on canonical benchmark noise models, including dephasing, amplitude damping, and depolarizing (Pauli) channels.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00172v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional spatiotemporal systems remains computationally challenging for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models due to gradient-based training and memory bottlenecks. Reservoir Computing (RC) mitigates these challenges by replacing backpropagation with fixed recurrent layers and a convex readout optimization, yet conventional RC architectures still scale poorly with input dimensionality. We introduce a Sequential Reservoir Computing (Sequential RC) architecture that decomposes a large reservoir into a series of smaller, interconnected reservoirs. This design reduces memory and computational costs while preserving long-term temporal dependencies. Using both low-dimensional chaotic systems (Lorenz63) and high-dimensional physical simulations (2D vorticity and shallow-water equations), Sequential RC achieves 15-25% longer valid forecast horizons, 20-30% lower error metrics (SSIM, RMSE), and up to three orders of magnitude lower training cost compared to LSTM and standard RNN baselines. The results demonstrate that Sequential RC maintains the simplicity and efficiency of conventional RC while achieving superior scalability for high-dimensional dynamical systems. This approach provides a practical path toward real-time, energy-efficient forecasting in scientific and engineering applications.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2312.03243v4 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are at the forefront of scientific machine learning, making possible the creation of machine intelligence that is cognizant of physical laws and able to accurately simulate them. However, today&#x27;s PINNs are often trained for a single physics task and require computationally expensive re-training for each new task, even for tasks from similar physics domains. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a pioneering approach to advance the generalizability of PINNs through the framework of Baldwinian evolution. Drawing inspiration from the neurodevelopment of precocial species that have evolved to learn, predict and react quickly to their environment, we envision PINNs that are pre-wired with connection strengths inducing strong biases towards efficient learning of physics. A novel two-stage stochastic programming formulation coupling evolutionary selection pressure (based on proficiency over a distribution of physics tasks) with lifetime learning (to specialize on a sampled subset of those tasks) is proposed to instantiate the Baldwin effect. The evolved Baldwinian-PINNs demonstrate fast and physics-compliant prediction capabilities across a range of empirically challenging problem instances with more than an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy at a fraction of the computation cost compared to state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning methods. For example, when solving the diffusion-reaction equation, a 70x improvement in accuracy was obtained while taking 700x less computational time. This paper thus marks a leap forward in the meta-learning of PINNs as generalizable physics solvers. Sample codes are available at https://github.com/chiuph/Baldwinian-PINN.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00462v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We present a spectroscopic characterization of 580 K dwarfs within 33 pc, observed with the CHIRON echelle spectrograph (R=80,000) on the SMARTS 1.5m telescope. This volume-limited sample is part of the RKSTAR survey of $\sim$4400 K dwarf primaries within 50 pc. Using Empirical SpecMatch and the diagnostic lines H-alpha (6562.8 Angstrom) and Li I (6707.8 Angstrom), we derive stellar properties, activity status, and age indicators calibrated against 35 benchmark K dwarfs with ages from 20 Myr to 5 Gyr. We find that 7.4% (43 stars) exhibit signatures of youth and/or chromospheric activity: 19 stars show lithium absorption indicating ages $&lt;$1 Gyr, and 36 display H$\alpha$ emission. Kinematic analysis using BANYAN $\Sigma$ identifies 8 additional young stars through membership in the AB Doradus moving group and the Hyades cluster, bringing the total young/active population to 8.8% (51 stars). Stellar parameters span 3600--5500 K in \teff, $-$0.60 to $+$0.55 dex in [Fe/H], and $&lt;$10 to $&gt;$25 km s$^{-1}$ in $v\sin i$. A metal-poor population ([Fe/H] $\leq -$0.50 dex) comprises 4\% of the sample. Galactic kinematics place 80% in the thin disk and 18.4% in the thick disk, with one halo member (HD 134439). Young and active stars are predominantly thin disk members, with two thick disk exceptions. Cross-matching with NASA&#x27;s Exoplanet Archive reveals only 7.5% (44 stars) host confirmed planets as of July 2025. Our results identify 529 mature, inactive K dwarfs as prime targets for terrestrial planet searches, providing a crucial resource for exoplanet habitability studies in the solar neighborhood.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2508.21755v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: This work presents an analysis of semantic communication in the context of First-Order Logic (FOL)-based deduction. Specifically, the receiver holds a set of hypotheses about the State of the World (SotW), while the transmitter has incomplete evidence about the true SotW but lacks access to the ground truth. The transmitter aims to communicate limited information to help the receiver identify the hypothesis most consistent with true SotW. We formulate the objective as approximating the posterior distribution of the transmitter at the receiver. Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation, this reduces to a constrained, finite-horizon resource allocation problem. Applying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions yields a truncated water-filling solution. Despite the problem&#x27;s non-convexity, symmetry and permutation invariance ensure global optimality. Based on this, we design message selection strategies, both for single- and multi- round communication, and model the receiver&#x27;s inference as an $m$-ary Bayesian hypothesis testing problem. Under the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) rule, our communication strategy achieves optimal performance within budget constraints. We further analyze convergence rates and validate the theoretical findings through experiments, demonstrating reduced error over random selection and prior methods.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2501.17192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Many mathematical models for biological phenomena, such as the spread of diseases, are based on reaction-diffusion equations for densities of interacting cell populations. We present a consistent derivation of reaction-diffusion equations from systems of suitably rescaled kinetic Boltzmann equations for distribution functions of cell populations interacting in a host medium. We show at first that the classical diffusive limit of kinetic equations leads to linear diffusion terms only. Then, we show possible strategies in order to obtain, from the kinetic level, macroscopic systems with nonlinear diffusion and also with cross-diffusion effects. The derivation from a kinetic description has the advantage of relating reaction and diffusion coefficients to the microscopic parameters of the interactions. We present an application of our approach to the study of the evolution of different bacterial populations on a leaf surface. Turing instability properties of the relevant macroscopic systems are investigated by analytical methods and numerical tools, with particular emphasis on pattern formation for varying parameters in two-dimensional space domains.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00742v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This perspective explores the evolution of materials informatics, from its foundational roots in physics and information theory to its maturation through artificial intelligence (AI). We trace the field&#x27;s trajectory from early milestones to the transformative impact of the Materials Genome Initiative and the recent advent of large language models (LLMs). Rather than a mere toolkit, we present materials informatics as an evolving ecosystem, reviewing key methodologies such as Bayesian Optimization, Reinforcement Learning, and Transformers that drive inverse design and autonomous self-driving laboratories. We specifically address the practical challenges of LLM integration, comparing specialist versus generalist models and discussing solutions for uncertainty quantification. Looking forward, we assess the transition of AI from a predictive tool to a collaborative research partner. By leveraging active learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), the field is moving toward a new era of autonomous materials science, increasingly characterized by &quot;human-out-of-the-loop&quot; discovery processes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00515v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Assembly theory (AT) introduces a concept of causation as a material property, constitutive of a metrology of evolution and selection. The physical scale for causation is quantified with the assembly index, defined as the minimum number of steps necessary for a distinguishable object to exist, where steps are assembled recursively. Observing countable copies of high assembly index objects indicates that a mechanism to produce them is persistent, such that the object&#x27;s environment builds a memory that traps causation within a contingent chain. Copy number and assembly index underlie the standardized metrology for detecting causation (assembly index), and evidence of contingency (copy number). Together, these allow the precise definition of a selective threshold in assembly space, understood as the set of all causal possibilities. This threshold demarcates life (and its derivative agential, intelligent and technological forms) as structures with persistent copies beyond the threshold. In introducing a fundamental concept of material causation to explain and measure life, AT represents a departure from prior theories of causation, such as interventional ones, which have so far proven incompatible with fundamental physics. We discuss how AT&#x27;s concept of causation provides the foundation for a theory of physics where novelty, contingency and the potential for open-endedness are fundamental, and determinism is emergent along assembled lineages.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00619v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Cobalt-free high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have garnered interest for nuclear structural applications due to their good mechanical performance, thermal stability, and resistance to radiation-induced degradation, while avoiding long-lived Co radioisotopes. This study presents an experimental and computational investigation of the plastic deformation behavior of a non-equatomic CrMnFeNi alloy, designed to maintain a stability of fcc phase in a large domain of temperatures and to balance stacking fault (SF) energies for enhanced strain hardening and ductility. Tensile tests reveal a temperature-dependent reduction in mechanical strength, attributed to thermally activated deformation mechanisms and microstructural evolution. Molecular dynamics simulations of single- and polycrystals capture dislocation activity, SF formation, and twin nucleation as a function of strain and temperature. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) confirms twin formation and grain boundary activity. The Schmid factor mapping is drawn to interpret local slip activity and anisotropic deformation behavior. The absence of Co leads to enhanced high-temperature strength compared to the Cantor alloy.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00161v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We present an NPT extension of Ewald summation with prolates (ESP), a spectrally accurate and scalable particle-mesh method for molecular dynamics simulations of periodic, charged systems. Building on the recently introduced ESP framework, this work focuses on rigorous and thermodynamically consistent pressure/stress evaluation in the isothermal--isobaric ensemble. ESP employs prolate spheroidal wave functions as both splitting and spreading kernels, reducing the Fourier grid size needed to reach a prescribed pressure accuracy compared with current widely used mesh-Ewald methods based on Gaussian splitting and B-spline spreading. We derive a unified pressure-tensor formulation applicable to isotropic, semi-isotropic, anisotropic, and fully flexible cells, and show that the long-range pressure can be evaluated with a single forward FFT followed by diagonal scaling, whereas force evaluation requires both forward and inverse transforms. We provide production implementations in LAMMPS and GROMACS and validate pressure and force accuracy on bulk water, LiTFSI ionic liquids, and a transmembrane system. Benchmarks on up to $3\times 10^3$ CPU cores demonstrate strong scaling and reduced communication cost at matched accuracy, particularly for NPT pressure evaluation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00757v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The outbreak of mutant strains and vaccination behaviors have been the focus of recent epidemiological research, but most existing epidemic models failed to simultaneously capture viral mutation and consider the complexity and behavioral dynamics of vaccination. To address this gap, we develop an extended SIRS model that distinguishes infections with the original strain and a mutant strain, and explicitly introduces a vaccinated compartment state. At the behavioral level, we employ evolutionary game theory to model individual vaccination decisions, where strategies are determined by both neighbors&#x27; choices and the current epidemiological situation. This process corresponds to the time-varying vaccination rate of susceptible individuals transitioning to vaccinated individuals at the epidemic spreading level. We then couple the epidemic and vaccination behavioral processes through the microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA) and finally investigate the evolutionary dynamics via numerical simulations. The results show that our framework can effectively mitigate outbreaks across different disease scenarios. Sensitivity analysis further reveals that vaccination uptake is most strongly influenced by vaccine cost, efficacy, and perceived risk of side effects. Overall, this behavior-aware modeling framework captures the co-evolution of viral mutation and vaccination behavior, providing quantitative and theoretical support for designing effective public health vaccination policies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00431v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: This work provides an alternative derivation of third order response functions in four wave mixing spectroscopy of multichromophoric macromolecular systems considering only single exciton states. For the case of harmonic oscillator bath linearly and diagonally coupled to exciton states, closed form expressions showing all the explicit time dependences are derived. These expressions can provide more solid physical basis for understanding 2-dimensional electronic spectroscopy signals. For more general cases of system-bath coupling, the quantum master equation (QME) approach is employed for the derivation of multistep time evolution equations for Green function-like operators. Solution of these equations is feasible at the level of 2nd order non-Markovian QME, and the new approach can account for inter-exciton coupling, dephasing, relaxation, and non-Markovian effects in a consistent manner.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00323v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Both abiotic self-organization and biological mechanisms have been put forward as the origin of a number of geological patterns. It is important to comprehend the formation mechanisms of such structures both to understand geological self-organization and in order to differentiate them from biological patterns -- fossils and bio-influenced structures -- seen in geological systems. Being able to distinguish the traces of biological activity from geological self-organization is fundamental both for understanding the origin of life on Earth and for the search for life beyond Earth.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Computational prediction of CRISPR-Cas9 off-target activity is a critical step toward the safe and scalable design of guide RNAs. Most existing deep learning models are trained on large proxy datasets derived from high-throughput assays; however, their performance often degrades when evaluated on experimentally validated off-target sites. This limitation raises concerns about the generalization ability of proxy-trained models and highlights the need for architectures that better transfer to biologically relevant benchmarks such as TrueOT. We propose a two-stage deep learning framework that decouples sequence representation learning from off-target classification. In the first stage, guide RNA sequences are encoded using pretrained transformer-based embeddings learned from large genomic corpora. In the second stage, a hybrid neural network integrates these embeddings with mismatch-level and sequence-pair features to predict off-target activity. Models are trained exclusively on a proxy dataset and evaluated under strict external validation on the TrueOT benchmark. Our results show that incorporating pretrained sequence embeddings substantially improves generalization performance. The full two-stage model achieves consistent improvements in ROC-AUC and PR-AUC on TrueOT, relative to proxy-only baselines, across repeated runs. We demonstrate a consistent generalization effect under distribution shift, robust to training noise, seeds, and evaluation variance. These findings provide empirical evidence that representation transfer plays a critical role in bridging the gap between proxy assay data and experimentally validated off-target behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) with epoxy is useful to enhance the mechanical toughness of 3D-printable epoxy inks. Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) like 1-Ethyl-3-Methylimidazolium dicyanamide ([EMIM][DCA]) have enhanced the self-assembly of pure BCP, enabling the formation of a controlled nanostructure. However, the mechanistic details of the morphological transitions of BCP to nanostructures in the presence of ILs remain unresolved. Here, we developed a coarse-grained (CG) model for a certain class of BCPs, namely Pluronic P123 in [EMIM][DCA] ionic liquid, to investigate the underlying mechanism beyond nanostructure transition of BCPs under varying temperature and composition. At various Pluronic compositions (20-60 wt%), P123 self-aggregates into spherical, cylindrical, and lamellar nanostructures, confirmed by visual inspection and quantitative metrics. An increase in the concentration of Pluronic leads to the formation of a more favorable self-interaction, resulting in a more ordered, lamellar-shaped aggregate. We suggest that morphological changes of nanostructure are governed by the balance between entropic and enthalpic factors. In a higher ordered shape (lamellar phase), enthalpic dominates, while in spherical-shaped micelles, both entropic and enthalpic are equivalent. Our CG model of PEO and PPO beads can be used to investigate the BCPs phase separation and will further help to understand the thermodynamics of self-aggregation for other BCPs in IL medium. This study will guide the acceleration of the discovery process for advanced 3D printable materials, including Pluronic P123 or other Pluronic materials.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> TiO2–reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrids were investigated in this study to elucidate how TiO2 morphology and surface chemistry govern charge-transfer pathways and, ultimately, reaction selectivity. Three anatase TiO2 nanostructures were compared: bipyramids predominantly exposing {101} facets (bipy) and two nanosheet-like samples enriched in {001} facets, either fluorinated (n-sh) or thermally defluorinated and {101}-enriched (n-sh_873K). A constant rGO loading (2 wt.%) was introduced via in situ hydrazine reduction of graphene oxide in the presence of TiO2. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated under Xe-lamp irradiation in two model reactions probing oxidative and reductive pathways: phenol degradation and H2 evolution using formic acid as a scavenger. rGO systematically enhanced phenol degradation for all morphologies, with bipy+rGO showing the highest activity. In contrast, H2 evolution was consistently suppressed upon rGO incorporation across all TiO2 samples, although the bipyramidal morphology remained the most active within each series. These results highlight that facet exposure and surface functionalization dictate the beneficial or detrimental role of rGO depending on the targeted photocatalytic pathway.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Operando Raman tracking shows how a carboxymethyl-cellulose coating modulates the reduction/oxidation kinetics and electro-chemo-mechanical degradation products of Na3SbS4 solid electrolyte interfaces in all-solid-state sodium batteries.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) attracted increasing attention due to their improved safety and energy densities; yet electrolyte decomposition and subsequent contact loss limited the interfacial stability of ASSBs. Herein, we report an operando Raman characterization that provides high voltage, time, and spatial resolutions, which enables simultaneous analysis of interfacial decomposition mechanism and morphological evolution. Using Na3SbS4 electrolyte (NSS) and its carboxymethyl-cellulose-encapsulated analogue (NSS-CMC) as exemplars, we precisely contrasted the subtle differences in the two-step reduction mechanism of the two electrolytes. In both systems, Na3SbS3 formed as an intermediate, and Na3Sb binary as one major final product; while the CMC coating altered the kinetics of Na3SbS3 formation and consumption, and extended the formation potential of Na3Sb from 1.35 V (seen in NSS) to 0.50 V (vs. Na/Na+). Oxidation of NSS and NSS-CMC both occur near 2.20 V, although CMC coating altered the crystallinity of the oxidative products. Simultaneously, we captured phenomena that are unique to solid-state electrochemical systems such as particle relocation, morphological change, and reversed reactions. We inferred CMC’s dual role as a voltage barrier and a mechanical buffer in suppressing the electro-chemo-mechanical decomposition of NSS electrolyte. The deep mechanistic insights unravel the exact modification needed for improved interfacial stability.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO₃RR → NH₃) suffers from poor selectivity and strong competition from hydrogen evolution. Here we show that materials-intrinsic electrostatic reprogramming of colloidal copper nitride (Cu₃N) nanocrystals provides a robust lever to bias NO₃RR. Two routes are established in a single electrolyte (0.50 M KNO₃ + 0.10 M KOH): (i) dilute Na incorporation that preserves the anti-ReO₃ (Pm-3m) lattice with small peak shifts, and (ii) Li treatment that amorphizes Cu₃N, yielding short-range–ordered Li–Cu–N. Across both families, cyclic voltammetry, LSV/Tafel analysis, and impedance spectroscopy reveal earlier cathodic onset (≈60–120 mV), reduced charge-transfer resistance (R_ct down to ~16 Ω from ~79 Ω for pristine), and favorable potential-of-zero-charge (PZC) shifts within the operating window. Chronoamperometry with indophenol quantification gives Faradaic efficiencies up to 74% and NH₃ production rates up to 8.8 × 10⁻³ mmol h⁻¹ mg⁻¹ (10% Li–Cu–N), with Tafel slopes of 120–167 mV dec⁻¹, consistent with a first electron-transfer step as rate determining. Electrolyte-cation spike and rinse–swap controls decouple double-layer effects from materials changes: gains on undoped Cu₃N vanish after rinsing, whereas Na-modified and Li-amorphous electrodes retain performance. The results delineate two complementary design paradigms lattice-level Na incorporation and controlled Li-induced amorphization that embed a beneficial interfacial field and accelerate NO₃RR without reactor or electrolyte redesign.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nipah virus (NiV) represents a catastrophic public health risk to the Indian subcontinent, as evidenced by recurring outbreaks in Kerala (2018, 2021, 2023) where case fatality rates reached as high as 70-90%. There are currently no clinically approved therapeutics or vaccines specifically for NiV. A major hurdle in the drug development pipeline is the high mutation rate of RNA viruses, which allows them to rapidly evolve resistance against site-specific inhibitors. This research project utilizes a multi-layered computational strategy to identify a small-molecule inhibitor capable of targeting the viral polymerase while maintaining efficacy against the predicted high-probability W730A resistance mutation. Through a first-principles assessment of the viral polymerase structure (PDB: 9KNZ), I established a design constraint called Allosteric Independence. This requires any lead candidate to bind in a pocket that is geometrically distinct from the mutation site W730, thereby preventing steric or electronic disruption upon mutation. After screening a library of 50 high-potential candidates using a rigid-receptor docking protocol, I identified BMS-986205 (Linrodostat), an investigational IDO1 inhibitor, as a superior lead. BMS-986205 demonstrated a binding affinity of -7.17 kcal/mol against the wild-type polymerase and a paradoxical increase to -7.29 kcal/mol against the W730A mutant. Geometric analysis confirmed a physical separation of 6.28 Å from the mutation site. Given its current status in global Phase 3 clinical trials for oncology, BMS-986205 is a primary candidate for rapid drug repurposing to secure India’s population against future outbreaks.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Molecular dynamics simulations on GPUs have historically required a trade-off between performance and numerical precision. Mixed-precision approaches, such as AMBER SPFP and OpenMM, accumulate forces in high precision while representing coordinates in single precision (FP32). This design introduces a fundamental “noise floor”: quantization error in FP32 coordinates injects artificial heat into the system, degrading long-term stability and distorting kinetic properties. We introduce MINT32, a coordinate representation that maps the simulation box onto a 32-bit integer grid. MINT32 achieves a spatial resolution of approximately 0.01 fm, roughly 300 times finer than FP32, without the memory bandwidth penalties associated with 64-bit integer arithmetic. In addition, MINT32 offers algorithmic elegance through self-wrapping, whereby periodic boundary conditions are enforced via exact integer overflow, eliminating branch divergence entirely. Benchmark results demonstrate that MINT32 reduces energy drift in microcanonical (NVE) simulations by nearly an order of magnitude (7--10x), delivering double-precision-level stability for challenging PME water systems. When paired with single-precision force evaluations, MINT32 outperforms conventional mixed-precision models, indicating that coordinate precision is the dominant factor governing simulation stability in the systems examined. The fixed-point grid further enables constraint solvers (SHAKE) to converge to tolerances of 10A, effectively eliminating constraint instabilities. Our implementation achieves approximately 85\% of production throughput on consumer-grade GPUs, serving as a conceptual foundation for future molecular dynamics (MD) engines. The primary objective of this study is to identify an optimal coordinate representation for next-generation MD software. To this end, we present a prototype framework designed to isolate and evaluate the numerical behavior of coordinate representations in molecular dynamics, with a modified version of the AMBER simulation package serving solely as a testbed.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chiral non-benzenoid nanographenes remain highly appealing but underexplored synthetic targets due to the lack of feasible synthetic strategies to simultaneously construct non-hexagonal rings and stable chirality. Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of a novel chiral saddle-shaped nanographene (cSNG) incorporating two heptagon-embedded [4]helicenes. The structure of cSNG is unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, demonstrating its flexible π-skeleton. Due to the heptagon-embedded [4]helicene subunits, cSNG exists as configurationally stable enantiomers, which enable chiral resolution and lead to pronounced chiroptical responses. Remarkably, the chiral saddle-shaped framework presents strong host–guest interactions with fullerenes C60 and C70, which were investigated via several titration methods. The association constants for a 1:1 complex, determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy titration (Ka(C60) = 2.3 × 104 M-1; Ka(C70) = 8.7 × 104 M-1), are among the highest values reported for negatively curved nanographenes. Moreover, crystallographic analysis of cocrystals of cSNG with C60 revealed a 1:3 binding mode for supramolecular complexation, featuring two fullerenes accommodated inside the saddle cavity as well as two shared fullerenes located on each concave outward facing side.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Molecular mechanisms governing initiation steps of the assembly of thousands of endogenous multi-protein complexes (EMCs) remain incompletely understood. Here, multiple lines of observations are reported reflecting the biological functions-aligned initiation sequence of hybrid assembly pathways (HAPs) of EMCs. HAPs postulate the creation of cell type-specific intracellular pools of hetero- and homodimers as the first step of chain reactions of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of EMCs’ assemblies. The consensus action sequence of HAPs consists of: a) Initiation on genomic DNA templates of the formation of metastable hetero- and homodimers of EMCs’ protein constituents; b) Release of dimers from DNA templates for delivery to the EMCs assembly compartments; c) Assembly of defined EMCs by sequential on demand addition to preformed dimers serving as attractors of EMC-specific monomers’ ensembles. Chromosome-naïve scaffolds of PPIs contributing to creation of intracellular dimer pools constitute genome-wide networks of binding sites for 716 transcription factors (TFs), 534 of which manifest patterns of significantly enriched expression in 1358 brain regions. The initiators’ loci of HAPs appear to operate within nucleosome-depleted islands of transposable elements (TE) – derived sequences within transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. Performance of PPI DNA template-guided assembly lines of EMCs is illustrated in two concurrent modes of PPI cascades: TF-TF PPI chains and TF-PPI Hub protein chains. Regardless of the number of DNA-bound TFs initiating the multistep PPI sequences at PPI initiators (ranging from one to 716 TFs), both modes of operations reached the equilibrium at the PPI constituents saturation levels of ~245 proteins for TF-TF PPI and of ~351 proteins for TF-PPI Hub Proteins’ assembly chains. Regardless of TF panels bound at HAP initiators, proteins of PPI-guided ensembles are enriched in either defined sets of neuroanatomical structures (TF-TF PPI path) or among structural-functional constituents of synapses (PPI Hub proteins path). Examples of default operation modes of DNA-template-guided assemblies of hetero- and homodimers of Yamanaka factors, neurogenesis constituents, and principal protein components of postsynaptic density of excitatory and inhibitory synaptogenesis are reported. Altogether, this contribution reports the foundational evidence for further experimental and theoretical explorations of retrotransposon-seeded genome-wide codes for initiators of PPI chain reactions of protein dimerization creating pools of attractors to guide and accelerate the EMC assemblies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a nonionic and highly water-soluble polymer, and PEGylation is widely used as a versatile chemical strategy to enhance the water solubility of otherwise poorly soluble molecules. The rational design of PEG-appended materials, therefore, requires an estimation of the PEG chain length necessary to achieve the desired level of solubility. Here, we investigated the relationship between the PEG chain length and the water solubility of PEG-appended molecules using a combination of experimental and computational approaches. We focused on monodisperse PEG with a discrete molecular weight, which enables us to identify the relationship between chain length and physicochemical properties, as represented by water solubility. Then, we designed a series of PEG‑appended molecules bearing monodisperse PEG chains of varying lengths, and measured their water solubilities experimentally. In parallel, molecular dynamics-based alchemical free‑energy calculations yielded thermodynamic trends that reproduced the observed dependence of solubility on PEG chain length. Comparison of experimental and computational results showed that the calculations not only distinguished between water-soluble and insoluble PEG-appended molecules but also captured the solubility trends for moderately soluble species. These findings demonstrate the potential of molecular-dynamics-based free-energy calculations for a priori prediction of the water solubility of PEG-appended molecules.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> G-quadruplex (G4) structures within oncogene promoters represent promising therapeutic targets, particularly in the context of transcriptional regulation. Here, we report that the Red box, a fully organic macrocyclic cationic receptor, exhibits high-affinity and selectivity for G4 structures. Biophysical analyses reveal that the Red box binds the c-MYC G4 with nanomolar affinity, stronger than most reported c-MYC ligands. Notably, the Red box displays greater selectivity for c-MYC over duplex DNA compared to the well-characterized porphyrin TMPyP4 and its macrocyclic architecture is essential for this activity, as its acyclic analogue displays negligible G4 stabilization. In cellular assays, treatment with non-cytotoxic concentrations of the Red box selectively downregulated c-MYC expression in HEK293T cells, with minimal effects on c-KIT and hTERT. Furthermore, c-MYC suppression was proportional to its basal expression across several cell lines, supporting a G4-mediated mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Successive maturation of ribosomal subunits occurs through multi-layered phase-separated structures of the cell nucleolus. The spatio-functional relationship between transcription of rRNA and nucleolar substructures and how this adapts to cellular stress remain incompletely understood. In this study, we resolve the sub nucleolar structures using expansion microscopy to reveal ordered structures of fibrillar center (FC) and dense fibrillar component (DFC) domains as nested shells, which is reorganized upon cellular stress like DNA damage or RNA polymerase I (RNAPI) inhibition. Direct visualization of nascent (5&#x27; ETS) and mature (28S) rRNA suggested that rRNA synthesis is the critical regulator of nucleolar size, and organization. Nucleolar reorganization upon stress emerges to be a direct function of nascent rRNA levels. Stress-induced transcription inhibition remodels the sub-nucleolar compartments from a viscoelastic state into solid-like condensates thereby perturbing the nucleolar pH gradient due to the missing rRNA scaffold. We show, that rather than signalling to mediate rDNA repair, nucleolar reorganization naturally arises primarily from reduced rRNA levels and the resultant biophysical restructuring of the nucleolus under cellular stress.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Presents a moments-based statistical framework to infer transcriptional regulation kinetics from single-cell nascent RNA measurements, improving model selection and parameter estimation over mature mRNA-based approaches in yeast and E. coli.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Unraveling the kinetics of transcriptional regulation is a central challenge in molecular biology. Traditional inference methods based on cell-to-cell mRNA variability are limited because mRNA levels reflect not only transcriptional activity but also post-transcriptional processes. Recent advances in quantifying nascent RNAs across isogenic cells provide a more direct readout of transcriptional dynamics. Here, we present a moments-based theoretical framework that leverages nascent RNA data to infer transcriptional kinetics. We derive closed-form expressions for the first two time-dependent moments of nascent RNA across three canonical transcription models and demonstrate that nascent RNA exhibits distinct transient overshoots and higher Fano factors compared to mature mRNA. Through analysis of synthetic datasets, we show that these features enable more accurate estimation of transcriptional kinetics and allow reliable model selection, distinguishing single from multi-pathway promoter activation with over 75% accuracy even from small sample sizes. We further validated our model selection method using real experimental transcription datasets in yeast and E. coli cells, with nascent RNA demonstrating superior performance in identifying cross-talk pathway regulation. Our framework thus offers a computationally efficient and mechanistically informative approach for decoding transcriptional dynamics, emphasizing the advantages of time-dependent nascent RNA measurements over mature mRNA in capturing the true kinetics of transcriptional regulation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Antarctic icefish are famous for living without red blood cells, but they are not alone. A species of needle-shaped, warm-water fish called the Asian noodlefish also lacks hemoglobin and red blood cells. Like icefish, its veins are filled with translucent white blood, said H. William Detrich, professor emeritus of marine and environmental sciences, who collaborated with Chinese scientists on a paper about the strange aquatic creatures published in Current Biology.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Genomic analysis of dosage-sensitive genes argues that ancestral flowering plants may not have undergone whole-genome duplications, refining a key hypothesis about angiosperm evolutionary origins rather than origins-of-life processes.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Angiosperms, also known as flowering plants, represent the most diverse group of seed plants, and their origin and evolution have long been a central question in plant evolutionary biology. Whole-genome duplication (WGD), or polyploidization, is widely recognized as a key driver of the origin and trait evolution of both seed plants and angiosperms.</p>
