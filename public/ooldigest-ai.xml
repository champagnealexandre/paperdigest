<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> TADF compounds have found great application as photocatalyst in recent years. Their use as photosensitizers (PS), however, is still limited although they have a huge potential as abundant alternatives for traditional noble metal-based PSs, such as [Ru(bpy)3]2+. We herein investigate the TADF compound 4CzIPN as a PS together with the catalyst cobaloxime (Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl) in the photochemical hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER). After optimization using a multi-batch screening photoreactor, we achieved turnover numbers (TONs) of over 5,000 with ammonium ascorbate as an abundant sacrificial electron donor (SED). Stern-Volmer quenching experiments and scalar-relativistic quantum-chemical calculations provided rate constants for the different processes in the photosensitization mechanism, demonstrating that the quenching of the excited singlet state (S1) of 4CzIPN by ammonium ascorbate is by far more dominant than the quenching of its excited triplet state (T1). This work demonstrates that 4CzIPN is capable of sensitizing the cobaloxime-catalyzed light-driven HER with ammonium ascorbate as the SED and gives an excited insight into the quenching mechanism of TADF compounds as PSs.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Develops an antimicrobial peptide–based PET imaging and targeted radionuclide therapy pair for specifically detecting and treating (methicillin-resistant) S. aureus infections, with limited relevance to origins-of-life research beyond general DNA-targeting biology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a major bacterial pathogen and a significant biothreat, representing a leading cause of bacterial mortality worldwide. The challenge is compounded by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), a strain resistant to first-line antibiotics, which is associated with a 64% higher mortality rate compared to susceptible strains. Current methods for accurately identifying and localizing occult infections are limited, and there is a critical lack of effective novel treatments for infections that fail to respond to antibiotics. To address this, we pioneered the development of an antimicrobial peptide (AMP)-based radiotheranostic pair for the imaging-guided treatment of S. aureus and MRSA infections. We first screened a library of renowned AMPs for their efficacy against (MR)SA and their suitability for non-invasive, whole-body PET imaging after radiolabeling with Gallium-68. The optimal candidate, [68Ga]QAMP3, demonstrated excellent performance, readily and specifically accumulating in both S. aureus and MRSA infection sites, but not in sterile inflammation or tumors. A pilot first-in-human study confirmed the translatable diagnostic potential and favorable biosafety profile of [68Ga]QAMP3. Furthermore, the corresponding therapeutic agent, [177Lu]QAMP3, effectively reduced bacterial load in rat models of septic arthritis caused by both S. aureus and MRSA following a single systemic administration. Treatment resulted in the complete restoration of joint morphology, comparable to healthy controls. Simultaneously, [68Ga]QAMP3 PET/CT imaging accurately monitored the therapeutic response to both [177Lu]QAMP3 and conventional antibiotic treatment. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the stable α-helical conformation of QAMP3 likely confers superior membrane permeability and subsequent internalization into bacterial cells, leading to lethal DNA damage. These findings position [68Ga]/[177Lu]QAMP3 as an innovative theranostic pair for the rapid diagnosis and effective treatment of MRSA infections. This study also paves the way for developing new radio-antibiotics with mechanisms of action that can circumvent conventional antibiotic resistance.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> RNA-seq comparison of rapamycin-treated D. melanogaster vs D. simulans shows sex- and tissue-dependent evolutionary divergence in mTOR-mediated transcriptional regulation despite overall conserved tissue expression.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Evolutionary divergence in gene regulation is a major source of phenotypic novelty, yet understanding how deeply conserved, pleiotropic signaling pathways evolve under selective constraint while maintaining essential cellular functions remains an important challenge. Here, we investigate the evolutionary divergence in transcriptional regulation mediated by the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in two related species, Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans. mTOR is a highly conserved central regulator of cellular growth and metabolism, making it well-suited for the study of regulatory evolution under functional constraint. Using a fully factorial RNA-seq design, we quantified transcriptional responses to mTOR inhibition by rapamycin across three tissues (head, thorax, and abdomen) and both sexes. Despite highly conserved tissue-specific expression - reflecting the close phylogenetic relationship between species - mTOR-mediated transcriptional responses showed clear evidence of evolutionary divergence. Divergence varied across tissues and sexes: heads of both sexes and female thoraces and abdomens showed the most rapid gene-level divergence, suggesting stronger directional selection, whereas male thorax and abdomen exhibited comparatively conserved responses, consistent with stabilizing selection. Gene-level divergence patterns were consistent across multiple metrics and generally mirrored pathway-level divergence, except in the female abdomen, which showed relative pathway-level conservation despite extensive gene-level divergence. Species-by-treatment interaction analyses further revealed divergence in core mTOR-regulated biological processes. Together, our results suggest that regulatory modularity may allow even highly conserved signaling pathways to evolve under context-specific selective pressures while maintaining critical functionality.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Experimental evolution shows that long-term ciliate predation can steer predictable genomic and phenotypic diversification in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, though abiotic adaptation dominates and virulence changes are modest and context dependent.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Opportunistic bacterial pathogens often encounter strong selective pressures outside their hosts, yet the evolutionary consequences of long-term predator exposure remain poorly understood. Here, we used experimental evolution to examine how sustained interaction with a eukaryotic predator shapes genomic adaptation, phenotypic diversification, and virulence-associated traits in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Replicate populations of P. aeruginosa were evolved for 60 days in the presence or absence of the ciliate predator Tetrahymena thermophila, followed by whole-population metagenomic sequencing, isolate-level genome sequencing, and quantitative phenotypic assays. We observed extensive genetic diversification across all populations, with strong signatures of both positive and purifying selection and pervasive parallel evolution at gene and nucleotide levels. Predator-exposed populations accumulated mutations enriched in regulatory, metabolic, and virulence-associated pathways, revealing predictable genomic targets of selection. However, many parallel mutations were shared between predator-exposed and predator-free populations, indicating that adaptation to the abiotic environment represented a dominant selective force. Genotype-phenotype analyses revealed pleiotropic effects and trade-offs linking motility, growth, and virulence-associated traits. Despite pronounced genomic adaptation and coordinated phenotypic shifts, changes in virulence in an in vivo host model were modest and context dependent. Taken together, our results indicate that predator exposure can influence evolutionary trajectories in P. aeruginosa and highlight the value of extending such approaches across multiple ecological and host contexts.</p>

A single strand of DNA (ssDNA) is attached to a homonucleotide header immobilized on a glass slide mounted on a platform in the cis chamber of an electrolytic cell (e-cell) with a nanopore. The header-strand is moved into the trans chamber and retracted mechanically one nucleotide at a time. Two approaches to sequencing are described. In the first the blockade current due to the segment of the header-strand in the pore is measured with a low bandwidth (&lt; 1 KHZ); a Markov-like method identifies the next base from earlier blockade current levels. In principle, with a bandwidth of 1 KHz and an array of ~600 pores with a CMOS detector array a human genome (3 × 109 bases) can be sequenced in &lt; 1.5 hours, or ~5 hours start-to-finish (sample preparation, ligation with header, threading, data acquisition, and post-processing, plus machine-learning-based methods for base calling). This theoretical sequencing speed is comparable to the practical speed of the recently reported Sequencing By Expansion (SBX) method; it remains to be seen if this level of performance can be delivered in practice. The second approach is based on replacing the enzyme motor in the Sequencing-by-Synthesis (SBS) method with a mechanical positioning system and using a header-strand with a hybridized primer. Synthesis consists of elongating the latter with a protected dNTP carrying a fluorescently tagged base that complements the next open base in the strand followed by deprotection of the dNTP and cleaving of the tag, the latter is detected optically with a Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) camera in trans. This electromechanical-optical alternative to SBS provides better control over sequencing by shielding earlier added nucleotides and reducing cross-talk in the neighborhood of the terminal nucleotide being extended. In theory, with a 1000 × 1000 array of DNA header-strands each ~200 bases long and a cycle time of ~90 seconds, a human chromosome can be sequenced in ~5 hours. The possibility of using the method for data retrieval from DNA-based storage is discussed.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Study dissects carbonate- and calcium-mediated adsorption competition on silicate mineral surfaces during flotation, offering only tangential relevance to origins-of-life via general mineral–water interfacial chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spodumene separation from gangue minerals such as quartz is challenging, as both silicate minerals are activated by metal cations, naturally present in process water, like Ca2+. Research has shown that when used as a pH modifier, Na2CO3 can depress both minerals, to different degrees, in the presence of Ca2+, but the mechanisms remain unclear. We use spectroscopic and computational methods to examine the interaction of Na2CO3 with Ca-activated quartz and spodumene surfaces in the presence of sodium oleate (NaOL) and the consequences for their selective flotation. Our results indicate that adsorption competition between the collector (Ca/OL complexes) and depressant (CaCO3) species occurs on spodumene and quartz surfaces. We provide detailed mechanisms of the interactions, including with respect to the adsorbed species, their relative amounts, surface charge, and the adsorption strengths. Although both the collector and depressant were adsorbed onto both minerals, the collector had more affinity for spodumene than quartz (-296.14 kJ/mol vs -192.99 kJ/mol), unlike the depressant (-288.55 kJ/mol vs -311.59 kJ/mol), hence the soda ash induced surface deprotonation and desorption of Ca/OL complexes from quartz during conditioning, but not from spodumene. Unlike quartz, which had only Ca as the surface site for reagent adsorption, spodumene also had surface Al sites. The results explain the limited depression of spodumene and the total depression of quartz in flotation using fatty acid-based collectors. Specifically, in the presence of Ca2+, Na2CO3 treatment increased the Li2O grades from 2.53 to 4.40 %, while maintaining a high lithium recovery of 71 %. Overall, the study demonstrated that, in addition to being a pH modifier, Na2CO3 acts as a selective quartz depressant in the Ca-activated flotation of spodumene-quartz, making it a more effective pH modifier than NaOH directly prior to spodumene flotation. Since quartz is a common gangue mineral in most flotation systems, these findings can be applied to benefit other flotation systems.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This preprint characterizes how head-to-tail cyclization of lanmodulin-inspired peptides alters lanthanide binding affinity and structure in aqueous solution, with limited direct relevance to origins-of-life questions beyond general insights into metal–peptide coordination.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Over the recent years lanthanide-binding proteins such as lanmodulin, a naturally lanthanide-binding EF-hand protein from Methylorubrum extorquens AM1, as well as protein-inspired lanthanide-binding peptides have become of increasing interest for the development of separation and recycling methods for rare earth elements. For the first time, a set of head-to-tail cyclised lanmodulin-inspired peptides and their complexation behaviour towards lanthanides was comprehensively examined in aqueous media using time-resolved laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies, complemented by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and advanced mass spectrometry methods. Results obtained from this multi-method approach evidence that the head-to-tail cyclisation can indeed increase the lanthanide-affinity in natural sequences and positively impact the pre-organisation of the metal-free peptide while limiting the amount of formed complex species in comparison to linear analogues. Furthermore, the impact of minimal sequence alterations by inserting glycine is shown to be useful in NMR experiments for probing alterations in the local environment of neighbouring amino acids potentially involved in coordination. Lastly, KD values for the peptides with the whole Ln series (except Pm) and the actinide curium are presented.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07235v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of sentiment analysis methods for movie reviews, a benchmark task that has played a central role in advancing natural language processing. We review the evolution of techniques from early lexicon-based and classical machine learning approaches to modern deep learning architectures and large language models, covering widely used datasets such as IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and SST-2, and models ranging from Naive Bayes and support vector machines to LSTM networks, BERT, and attention-based transformers. Beyond summarizing prior work, this survey differentiates itself by offering a comparative, challenge-driven analysis of how these modeling paradigms address domain-specific issues such as sarcasm, negation, contextual ambiguity, and domain shift, which remain open problems in existing literature. Unlike earlier reviews that focus primarily on text-only pipelines, we also synthesize recent advances in multimodal sentiment analysis that integrate textual, audio, and visual cues from movie trailers and clips. In addition, we examine emerging concerns related to interpretability, fairness, and robustness that are often underexplored in prior surveys, and we outline future research directions including zero-shot and few-shot learning, hybrid symbolic--neural models, and real-time deployment considerations. Overall, this abstract provides a domain-focused roadmap that highlights both established solutions and unresolved challenges toward building more accurate, generalizable, and explainable sentiment analysis systems for movie review data.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This paper develops a MIMO-aware semantic video transmission framework with variable-length and variable-rate coding for wireless communications, with no direct connection to origins-of-life or astrobiology topics.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06059v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The evolution of semantic communications has profoundly impacted wireless video transmission, whose applications dominate driver of modern bandwidth consumption. However, most existing schemes are predominantly optimized for simple additive white Gaussian noise or Rayleigh fading channels, neglecting the ubiquitous multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) environments that critically hinder practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we propose the context video semantic transmission (CVST) framework under MIMO channels. Building upon an efficient contextual video transmission backbone, CVST effectively learns a context-channel correlation map to explicitly formulate the relationships between feature groups and MIMO subchannels. Leveraging these channel-aware features, we design a multi-reference entropy coding mechanism, enabling channel state-aware variable length coding. Furthermore, CVST incorporates a checkerboard-based feature modulation strategy to achieve multiple rate points within a single trained model, thereby enhancing deployment flexibility. These innovations constitute our multi-reference variable length and rate coding (MR-VLRC) scheme. By integrating contextual transmission with MR-VLRC, CVST demonstrates substantial performance gains over various standardized separated coding methods and recent wireless video semantic communication approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/xie233333/CVST.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06110v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This paper investigates the uplink covert communication in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) satellite-terrestrial system consisting of an Earth station transmitter Alice, a geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) satellite receiver Bob, and multiple GEO satellite wardens around Bob, where each node in the system is equipped with an array of directional antennas. Based on beamforming and the default antenna orientation setting, we first propose a scheme for covert Alice-Bob uplink transmission. Under the perfect channel estimation scenario, we provide theoretical modeling for the system performance in terms of detection error probability (DEP), transmission outage probability (TOP) and covert rate (CR), and then explore the optimal beamforming (OB) design as well as the joint optimal beamforming and antenna orientation (JO-BA) design for CR maximization. We then extend our study to the imperfect channel estimation scenario, and conduct related performance modeling and OB/JO-BA designs for CR maximization. We also apply the techniques of semidefinite relaxation, alternating optimization, Rodrigues&#x27; rotation formula and 1-D search algorithm to develop efficient algorithms to solve the above optimization problems. Finally, extensive numerical results are presented to verify our theoretical results and to illustrate the efficiency of beamforming and antenna orientation design for supporting the uplink covert communication in MIMO GEO satellite-terrestrial systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06095v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning based solution for jamming communications using Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum technology in a 16 channel radio environment is presented. Deep Q Network based transmitter continuously selects the next frequency hopping channel while facing first order reactive jamming, which uses observed transition statistics to predict and interrupt transmissions. Through self training, the proposed agent learns a uniform random frequency hopping policy that effectively neutralizes the predictive advantage of the jamming. In the presence of Rayleigh fading and additive noise, the impact of forward error correction Bose Chaudhuri Hocquenghem type codes is systematically evaluated, demonstrating that even moderate redundancy significantly reduces packet loss. Extensive visualization of the learning dynamics, channel utilization distribution, epsilon greedy decay, cumulative reward, BER and SNR evolution, and detailed packet loss tables confirms convergence to a near optimal jamming strategy. The results provide a practical framework for autonomous resilient communications in modern electronic warfare scenarios.</p>

This paper proposes a novel jamming detection framework leveraging dynamic graphs and graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) to address this challenge. By modeling the network as a dynamic graph, we capture evolving communication links and detect jamming attacks as anomalies in the graph evolution. A GCN-Transformer-based model, trained with supervised learning, learns graph embeddings to identify malicious interference. Performance evaluation in simulated scenarios with moving UEs, varying jamming conditions and channel fadings, demonstrates the method&#x27;s effectiveness, which is assessed through accuracy and F1 score metrics, achieving promising results for effective jamming detection.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Analytical modeling of coverage and spectral efficiency in NOMA-enabled LEO satellite downlink networks, with ordering and power-allocation schemes, but no connection to origins-of-life or astrobiology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2501.05946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: This paper investigates an analytical model for low-earth orbit (LEO) multi-satellite downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. The satellites transmit data to multiple NOMA user terminals (UTs), each employing successive interference cancellation (SIC) for decoding. Two ordering schemes are adopted for NOMA-enabled LEO satellite networks, i.e., mean signal power (MSP)-based ordering and instantaneous signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (ISINR)-based ordering. For each ordering scheme, we derive the analytical expression for the coverage probability of each typical UT. Moreover, we discuss how coverage is influenced by SIC, main-lobe gain, and tradeoffs between the number of satellites and their altitudes. Additionally, two user fairness-based power allocation (PA) schemes are considered, and PA coefficients with the optimal number of UTs that maximize their sum spectral efficiency (SE) are studied. Simulation results show that there exists a maximum effective signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold for each PA scheme that ensures the operation of NOMA in LEO satellite networks, and NOMA provides performance gains only when the target SINR is below a certain threshold. Compared with orthogonal multiple access (OMA), NOMA increases UTs&#x27; sum SE by as much as 35%. Furthermore, for most SINR thresholds, the sum SE increases with the number of UTs to the highest value, whilst the maximum sum SE is obtained when there are two UTs.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Develops algorithms and coding-theoretic bounds to reduce sequencing reads for random access retrieval in engineered DNA data storage, with limited direct relevance to origins-of-life research beyond the use of DNA as an information substrate.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07053v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: As DNA data storage moves closer to practical deployment, minimizing sequencing coverage depth is essential to reduce both operational costs and retrieval latency. This paper addresses the recently studied Random Access Problem, which evaluates the expected number of read samples required to recover a specific information strand from $n$ encoded strands. We propose a novel algorithm to compute the exact expected number of reads, achieving a computational complexity of $O(n)$ for fixed field size $q$ and information length $k$. Furthermore, we derive explicit formulas for the average and maximum expected number of reads, enabling an efficient search for optimal generator matrices under small parameters. Beyond theoretical analysis, we present new code constructions that improve the best-known upper bound from $0.8815k$ to $0.8811k$ for $k=3$, and achieve an upper bound of $0.8629k$ for $k=4$ for sufficiently large $q$. We also establish a tighter theoretical lower bound on the expected number of reads that improves upon state-of-the-art bounds. In particular, this bound establishes the optimality of the simple parity code for the case of $n=k+1$ across any alphabet $q$.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present a comprehensive investigation of the low-temperature topochemical modification of the Ruddlesden–Popper-type indium oxyfluoride LaBaInO3F2 using sodium hydride (NaH). By varying NaH equivalents, we monitored phase evolution, anion exchange, and reduction pathways using combined structural, spectroscopic, elemental and the density functional theory (DFT) analysis. LaBaInO3F2 undergoes controlled anion-extraction, with hydride-for-fluoride substitution produces mixed-anion oxy-fluoride-hydride phases, LaBaInO3F2−xHy, and NaF as a stable by-product. At moderate xNaH contents (x≤1), the RP-framework incorporates hydride with minimal decomposition, supported by re-oxidation experiments and DFT-calculated reaction enthalpies that confirm oxidizable hydride and subtle modification of the indium coordination environment. For xNaH&gt;1 result in the formation of secondary phases, indicating progressive lattice degradation. XPS indicates the possibility of subtle reduction of indium, with redox changes secondary to anion exchange. The executed study revealed a pathway how to stabilize hydride ions next to In3+, which is known to be notoriously hard otherwise. Optical spectroscopy reveals bandgap narrowing and enhanced visible-light absorption in hydride-rich samples, however, DFT estimates that idealized hydride substitution widens the bandgap, consistent with the experimentally non-ideal reduction with secondary phases. Overall, these findings establish hydride-based topochemical strategies as a promising route for controlled anion exchange with implications for photocatalytic and energy applications.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06324v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Existing methods rarely capture the temporal evolution of solution norms in vector nonlinear DDEs with variable delays and coefficients, often leading to overly conservative boundedness and stability criteria. We develop a framework that constructs scalar counterparts of vector DDEs whose solutions upper-bound the evolution of the original solution norms when the corresponding history functions are matched. This reduction enables boundedness and stability assessment of vector DDEs through the dynamics of their scalar counterparts, using straightforward simulations or simplified analytical reasoning. New boundedness and stability criteria and the estimates of the radii of balls containing history functions that yield bounded or stable solutions for the original vector systems were derived and validated through representative simulations.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Quantifies light-driven photochemical propulsion forces in Au–TiO2 Janus micromotors (including DNA-functionalized variants), offering a single-particle framework for measuring active non-equilibrium forces with only indirect relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Active colloids that convert light into motion provide insight into non-equilibrium chemical systems and routes toward microscale engines. Here we quantify the propulsion dynamics and force generation of light-activated Au-TiO2 Janus particles and their optically trappable polystyrene (PS) core-shell Au-PS@TiO2 analogues. By varying particle size, metal thickness, fuel concentration, and illumination wavelength, we show how photochemical energy conversion at the Au-TiO2 interface governs propulsion, yielding instantaneous velocities up to ~100 μm s⁻¹. Optical tweezers measurements on single Au-PS@TiO2 Janus particles reveal transient propulsion forces up to 20 pN lasting hundreds of milliseconds. Simulations incorporating these transient forces reproduce the observed trajectories, confirming their role in driving active motion. Functionalization with long DNA polymers further enhances propulsion by reducing rotational diffusion. These results establish a single-particle framework for quantifying active forces in photocatalytic Janus particles and offer design principles for light-powered micromotors.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06330v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Stability and boundedness analysis for vector nonlinear systems with variable delays and coefficients remains challenging due to the conservatism of existing methods. Moreover, estimates of the transient behavior of solution norms remain insufficiently developed. This paper presents an approach to estimate the temporal evolution of solution norms and applies it to the analysis of boundedness and stability of vector nonlinear systems with variable delays and coefficients. The method is based on a novel scheme for successive approximations of the original solutions, complemented by the estimates of the corresponding residual norms. This leads to the construction of a scalar nonlinear delay equation whose solutions provide upper bounds for the evolution of residual norms. As a result, bilateral bounds on the original solution norms are obtained, yielding effective boundedness and stability criteria and enabling estimation of the associated regions. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approximations rapidly approach the reference boundaries of the regions of interest as the iteration count increases. Moreover, the bilateral bounds progressively approach each other and the norm of the reference solution when the initial function remains within the considered regions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06387v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Few-for-many (F4M) optimization, recently introduced as a novel paradigm in multi-objective optimization, aims to find a small set of solutions that effectively handle a large number of conflicting objectives. Unlike traditional many-objective optimization methods, which typically attempt comprehensive coverage of the Pareto front, F4M optimization emphasizes finding a small representative solution set to efficiently address high-dimensional objective spaces. Motivated by the computational complexity and practical relevance of F4M optimization, this paper proposes a new evolutionary algorithm explicitly tailored for efficiently solving F4M optimization problems. Inspired by SMS-EMOA, our proposed approach employs a $(\mu+1)$-evolution strategy guided by the objective of F4M optimization. Furthermore, to facilitate rigorous performance assessment, we propose a novel benchmark test suite specifically designed for F4M optimization by leveraging the similarity between the R2 indicator and F4M formulations. Our test suite is highly flexible, allowing any existing multi-objective optimization problem to be transformed into a corresponding F4M instance via scalarization using the weighted Tchebycheff function. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms, especially on instances involving a large number of objectives. The source code of the proposed algorithm will be released publicly. Source code is available at https://github.com/MOL-SZU/SoM-EMOA.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07348v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Self-evolution methods enhance code generation through iterative &quot;generate-verify-refine&quot; cycles, yet existing approaches suffer from low exploration efficiency, failing to discover solutions with superior complexity within limited budgets. This inefficiency stems from initialization bias trapping evolution in poor solution regions, uncontrolled stochastic operations lacking feedback guidance, and insufficient experience utilization across tasks.To address these bottlenecks, we propose Controlled Self-Evolution (CSE), which consists of three key components. Diversified Planning Initialization generates structurally distinct algorithmic strategies for broad solution space coverage. Genetic Evolution replaces stochastic operations with feedback-guided mechanisms, enabling targeted mutation and compositional crossover. Hierarchical Evolution Memory captures both successful and failed experiences at inter-task and intra-task levels.Experiments on EffiBench-X demonstrate that CSE consistently outperforms all baselines across various LLM backbones. Furthermore, CSE achieves higher efficiency from early generations and maintains continuous improvement throughout evolution.

This paper presents an exact analytical approach to studying DQPTs by combining complex dynamics with the real-space renormalization group (RG). RG transformations are interpreted as iterated maps on the complex plane, establishing a connection between DQPTs and the Julia set, the boundary separating the basins of attraction of the stable fixed points. This framework is applied to a quantum quench in the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, where we examine the sensitivity of DQPTs to variations in boundary conditions. We show that altering the topology of the spin chain can suppress DQPTs and provide a qualitative explanation based on quantum speed limits.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07080v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Lava worlds are rocky planets with dayside skins made molten by stellar irradiation. Tidal heating on these shortest-period planets is more than skin deep. We show how orbital eccentricities of just a few percent (within current observed bounds and maintained secularly by exterior companions) can create deep magma oceans. ``Lava tidal waves&#x27;&#x27; slosh across these oceans; we compute the multi-modal response of the ocean to tidal forcing, subject to a coastline at the day-night terminator and a parameterized viscous drag. Wave interference produces a dayside heat map that is spatially irregular and highly time-variable; hotspots can wander both east and west of the substellar point, and thermal light curves can vary and spike aperiodically, from orbit to orbit and within an orbit. Heat deposited by tides is removed in steady state by a combination of fluid, mushy, and solid-state convection in the mantle. For Earth-sized planets with sub-day periods, the entire mantle may be tidally liquified.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Uses an energy-balance climate model with a carbonate–silicate cycle to argue early Mars plausibly underwent episodic warm–cold limit cycles that could intermittently permit liquid water and explain timing of valley networks and deltas.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07159v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Evidence for fluvial features and standing liquid water indicate that Mars was a warmer and wetter place in its past; however, climate models have historically been unable to produce conditions to yield a warm early Mars under the faint young sun. Some models invoke thick greenhouse atmospheres to produce continuously warm conditions, but others have argued that available geologic evidence is more consistent with short-duration and transient warming events on an otherwise cold Mars. One possibility of harmonizing these perspectives is that early Mars experienced climate limit cycles that caused the climate to oscillate between short periods of warmth and prolonged periods of glaciation, due to modulation of greenhouse warming by the carbonate-silicate cycle. This study suggests that episodic limit cycling during the Noachian and Hesperian periods provides a hypothetical explanation for the timing and formation of fluvial features on Mars. A schematic time-forward trajectory of the full history of Mars is calculated using an energy balance climate model, which includes an active carbonate-silicate cycle, instellation changes due to the sun&#x27;s main sequence evolution, variations in the obliquity of Mars, and supplemental warming from additional greenhouse gases beyond carbon dioxide alone. These calculations demonstrate the viability of a climate history for Mars involving episodic limit cycling to enable the formation of the valley networks at 4.1-3.5 Ga and delta features at 3.3-3.0 Ga, interspersed with cold stable climates and ending in the late Amazonian in a carbon dioxide condensation regime. This schematic climate trajectory provide a plausible narrative that remains consistent with available geologic data, and further exploration of warming mechanisms for the climate of Mars should consider the possibility of episodic transient events driven by carbonate-silicate limit cycling.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06263v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Among the many recommendations of the Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020, we found that a priority area of research is to pave the pathways towards finding and characterizing habitable worlds. In this context, we aim to understand how planetary systems evolve through atmospheric escape, and develop techniques to identify potentially Earth-like worlds. Using the ultraviolet (UV) capabilities of the Habitable Worlds Observatory, we can use transit spectroscopy observations to determine what processes drive the evolution of exoplanets, how well can small exoplanets retain atmospheres, and search for Earth-like atmospheres. We advocate the development of a UV spectrograph that is capable of moderate- to high-resolution spectroscopy of point sources, access to key spectral features between 1000 and 3000 Angstrom, and UV detectors that are resilient to high count rates.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07471v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent models of the near-Earth asteroid population show that asteroids must be super-catastrophically destroyed when they evolve to orbits with perihelion passages well inside of Mercury&#x27;s orbit. The heliocentric distances at which the disruptions typically occur are tens of solar radii, which is too far from the Sun for asteroids to be destroyed by sublimation and tidal disruption. The typical disruption distance also appears to be larger for darker asteroids. Here, by carrying out irradiance experiments in vacuum that replicate the conditions in the near-Sun environment, we show that CI meteorite simulants are destroyed within minutes when exposed to the level of solar irradiance encountered at heliocentric distances of up to about 0.2 au. Our results provide an explanation for the scarcity of dark, carbonaceous asteroids with perihelion distances less than 0.2 au, and for the observed mass-loss rate of the asteroid-like object 322P/SOHO~1 assuming its composition is similar to CI carbonaceous chondrites.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06386v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Executive Summary: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is the first astrophysics flagship mission with a key cross-divisional astrobiology science goal of searching for signs of life on rocky planets beyond our solar system. The Living Worlds Working Group under the Science, Technology, and Architecture Review Team (START) was charged with investigating how HWO could characterize potentially habitable exoplanets orbiting stars in the solar neighborhood, search for signs of life, and interpret potential biosignatures within a false positive and false negative framework. In particular, we focused on (1) identifying biosignatures that have spectral features in the UV-Vis-NIR wavelength range and defining their measurement requirements, (2) determining additional information needed from the planet and planet system to interpret biosignatures and assess the likelihood of false positives, and (3) assembling current knowledge of likely HWO target stars and identify which properties of host stars and systems are most critical to know in advance of HWO. The Living Worlds atmospheric biosignatures science case is considered one of the key drivers in the design of the observatory. An additional 10 astrobiology science cases were developed that collectively revealed key research gaps and needs required to fully explore the observatory parameter space and perform science return analyses. Investment in these research gaps will require coordination across the Science Mission Directorate and fall under the purview of the new Division-spanning astrobiology strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07465v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: One of the primary mission goals of the Kepler space telescope was to detect Earth-like terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around Sun-like stars. These planets are at the detection limit, where the Kepler detection and vetting pipeline produced unreliable planet candidates. We present a novel pipeline that improves the removal of localized defects prior to the planet search, improves vetting at the level of individual transits and introduces a Bayes factor test statistic and an algorithm for extracting multiple candidates from a single detection run. We show with injections in the Kepler data that the introduced novelties improve pipeline&#x27;s completeness at a fixed false alarm rate. We apply the pipeline to the stars with previously identified planet candidates and show that our pipeline successfully recovers the previously confirmed candidates, but flags a considerable portion of unconfirmed candidates as likely false alarms, especially in the long period, low signal-to-noise ratio regime. In particular, several known Earth-like candidates in the habitable zone, such as KOI 8063.01, 8107.01 and 8242.01, are identified as false alarms, which could have a significant impact on the estimates of $\eta_{\oplus}$, i.e., the occurrence of Earth-like planets in the habitable zone.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07414v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We report the confirmation of three transiting exoplanets orbiting TOI-1243 (LSPM~J0902+7138), TOI-4529 (G~2--21), and TOI-5388 (Wolf~346) that were initially detected by TESS through ground-based photometry and radial velocity follow-up measurements with CARMENES. The planets present short orbital periods of $4.65$, $5.88$, and $2.59$ days, and they orbit early-M dwarfs (M2.0V, M1.5V, and M3.0V, respectively). We were able to precisely determine the radius of all three planets with a precision of $&lt; 7\, \%$, the mass of TOI-1243 b with a precision of $19\, \%$, and upper mass limits for TOI-4529 b and TOI-5388 b. The radius of TOI-1243 b is $2.33\pm0.12\, {R_{\oplus}}$, its mass is $7.7 \pm 1.5\,{M_{\oplus}}$, and the mean density is $0.61 \pm 0.15 \, {\rho_\oplus}$. The radius of TOI-4529 b is $1.77 ^{+0.09}_{-0.08} \, {R_{\oplus}}$, the $3 {\sigma}$ upper mass limit is $4.9 \, {M_{\oplus}}$, and the $3 {\sigma}$ upper density limit is $0.88\, {\rho_\oplus}$. The third planet, TOI-5388 b, is Earth-sized with a radius of $0.99 ^{+0.07}_{-0.06} \, {R_{\oplus}}$, a $3 {\sigma}$ upper mass limit of $2.2 \, {M_{\oplus}}$, and a $3 {\sigma}$ upper density limit of $2.2\, {\rho_\oplus}$. While TOI-5388 b is most probably rocky, given its Earth-like radius, TOI-1243 b and TOI-4529 b are located in a highly degenerate region in the mass-radius space. TOI-4529 b appears to lean toward a water-world composition. TOI-1243 b has enough mass to host a significant H-He envelope, although a water-world and pure rocky compositions are also consistent with the data. Our analysis indicates that future atmospheric observations using JWST can aid in determining their real composition. The sample of small planets around M dwarfs is widely used to understand planet formation and composition theories, and our study adds three planets to this sample.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07457v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Small aromatic molecules, including functionalized derivatives of benzene, are known to be present throughout the different stages of star and planet formation. In particular, oxygen-bearing monosubstituted aromatics, likely including phenol, have been identified in the coma of comet 67P. This suggests that, earlier in the star and planet formation evolution, icy grains may act as both reservoirs and sites of functionalization for these small aromatics. We investigate the ice-phase reactivity of singlet oxygen atoms (O($^1$D)) with benzene, using ozone as a precursor that is readily photodissociated by relatively low-energy. Our experiments show that O($^1$D) efficiently reacts with benzene, forming phenol, benzene oxide, and oxepine as the main products. Phenol formation is temperature-independent, consistent with a barrierless insertion mechanism. In contrast, the formation of benzene oxide/oxepine shows a slight temperature dependence, suggesting that additional reaction pathways involving either ground-state or excited-state oxygen atoms may contribute. In H$_2$O and \COO ice matrices we find that dilution does not suppress formation of phenol. We extrapolate an experimental upper limit for the benzene-to-phenol conversion fraction of 27-44$\%$ during the lifetime of an interstellar cloud, assuming O($^1$D) production rates based on CO$_2$ ice abundances and a cosmic-ray induced UV field. We compare these estimates with a new analysis of data from the comet 67P, where the C$_6$H$_6$O/C$_6$H$_6$ ratio is 20$\pm$6$\%$. This value lies within our estimated range, suggesting that O($^1$D)-mediated chemistry is a viable pathway for producing oxygenated aromatics in cold astrophysical ices, potentially enriching icy planetesimals with phenol and other biorelevant compounds.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06236v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The transit method, during which a planet&#x27;s presence is inferred by measuring the reduction in flux as it passes in front of its parent star, is a highly successful exoplanet detection and characterization technique. During transit, the small fraction of starlight that passes through a planet&#x27;s atmosphere emerges with the fingerprints of atmospheric gases, aerosols and structure. During eclipse, the relatively small contribution of light from the planet itself may be observed as the planet is occulted by the star. For planets in near-edge-on, short-period orbits, observing the system throughout an entire orbit allows the varying flux from the planet to be extracted as the illuminated `dayside&#x27; rotates in and out of view. With spectroscopic observations, we can characterize not only the overall composition of the atmosphere, but also glean insights into atmospheric structure and dynamics. With over 6,000 transiting planets now discovered, such observations are currently our only window into a consistent sample of planetary atmospheres large enough to attempt a population-level study, a critical next step for our understanding of atmospheric science. The vast exoplanet population provides a laboratory for atmospheric physics, including chemistry, dynamics, cloud processes and evolution; extending these results to a larger number of targets will allow us to explore the effects of equilibrium temperature, gravity, mass and parent star type on atmospheric properties, as well as map observable trends to formation scenarios. These findings are critical for addressing STFC&#x27;s Science Vision Challenge B: how do stars and planetary systems develop and how do they support the existence of life?. Here we outline how the UK must fit within this strategic context, suggest approaches and development for the future, and outline the unique capabilities and leadership of scientists across the UK.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07088v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Dust plays a fundamental role during protostellar collapse, disk and planet formation. Recent observations suggest that efficient dust growth may begin early, in the protostellar envelopes, potentially even before the formation of the disk. Three-dimensional models of protostellar evolution, addressing multi-size dust growth, gas and dust dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics, are required to characterize the dust evolution in the embedded stages of star formation. We aim to establish a new framework for dust evolution models, following in 3D the dust size distribution both in time and space, in MHD models describing the formation and evolution of star-disk systems, at low numerical cost. We present our work coupling the COALA dust evolution module into the code RAMSES, performing the first 3D MHD simulation of protostellar collapse including simultaneously polydisperse dust growth modeled by the Smoluchowski equation as well as dust dynamics in the terminal velocity approximation. Ice-coated micron-sized grains can rapidly grow in the envelope and survive by not entering the fragmentation regime. The evolution of the dust size distribution is highly anisotropic due to the turbulent nature of the collapse and the development of favorable locations such as outflow cavity walls, which enhance locally the dust-to-gas ratio. We analyzed the first 3D non-ideal MHD simulations that self-consistently account for the dust dynamics and growth during the protostellar stage. Very early in the lifetime of a young embedded protostar, micron-sized grains can grow, and locally the dust size distribution deviates significantly from the MRN initial shape. This new numerical method opens the perspective to treat simultaneously gas/dust dynamics and dust growth in 3D simulations at a low numerical cost for several astrophysical environments.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Models the heliocentric dust ring co-orbital with Venus to estimate particle distributions and spacecraft impact risk, with only marginal relevance to origins-of-life or astrobiology beyond Solar System context.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2504.16610v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: A heliocentric dust ring on Venus orbit was discovered following observations by the Helios spacecraft, and then confirmed thanks to observations by STEREO and the Parker Solar Probe. The impact risk it poses needs to be evaluated for any spacecraft crossing the ring. This study aims to provide a first model of the dust ring, in terms of distribution of particles (including size distribution), velocity, density of the ring, and deduce a first estimation of the impact risk to spacecrafts crossing the ring. We seek to describe the orbits of dust particles in the ring. We explore a first simple model, that leads us to propose a second, more elaborate, model. This model is then populated by particles that we integrate for 2000 years. We demonstrate that the dust ring will persist over the next 2000 years, only slightly extending radially and perpendicularly to the Venus orbital plane. We show that particles tend to accumulate at Venus orbit, but that along it the differences in density is negligible. We compute the number of particles we can expect to find in the ring. Finally, as an example, we apply this model to Bepi-Colombo to obtain a first estimate of the impact flux in function of radius and mass, for radii between 2 $\mu$m and 2 cm (i.e. for masses between 10^-2 kg and 10^-14 kg). We also present the impact velocity and direction of impacts with respect to Bepi-Colombo. We are able to conclude that the ring seems to present a low risk for spacecrafts using Venus as a gravity assist.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a neural-operator framework (DyMixOp) for improved PDE forecasting via a local-global mixing transformation and dynamics-informed design, with no direct connection to origins-of-life or astrobiology topics.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2508.13490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is transforming these systems into a suitable format, especially when dealing with non-linearizable dynamics or the need for infinite-dimensional spaces for linearization. This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework for PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address this challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent space, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear interactions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in turbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details and nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in existing neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a dynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate linear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical systems. Experimental results across diverse PDE benchmarks demonstrate that DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing prediction errors, particularly in convection-dominated scenarios reaching up to 86.7\%, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2510.11707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: We study the honeycomb lattice with a single magnetic impurity modeled by adding imaginary next-nearest-neighbor hopping ih on a single hexagon. This Haldane defect gives a topological mass term to the gapless Dirac cones and generates chirality. For a small density of defects Neehus et al [arXiv:2405.19289] found that the system&#x27;s chirality reverses at a critical hc ~ 0.95 associated with an unexpected tri-critical point of Dirac fermions at zero defect density. We investigate this zero-density limit by analyzing a single defect and computing two experimentally relevant measures of chirality: (1) orbital magnetization via local Chern marker, a bulk probe of all occupied states; and (2) electronic currents of low-energy states. Both probes show a chirality reversal at a critical hc ~ 0.9--1. Motivated by this consistency we propose a defect-scale toy model whose low energy states reverse their chirality at hc&#x27; ~ 0.87. Remarkably, the same pair of zero energy bound states also generate the critical point hc in the full impurity projected T-matrix. Our results show how the chirality reversal produced by an impurity can be observed either in local probes or in the global topology and suggest a possible role of the microscopic defect structure at the critical point.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06620v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The study of global-in-time dynamics of vacuum is crucial for understanding viscous flows. However, the corresponding large-data problems for multidimensional spherically symmetric flows have remained open, due to the coordinate singularity at the origin and the strong degeneracy on the moving boundary. In this paper, we analyze the vacuum free boundary problem for the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate density-dependent viscosity coefficients (as in the shallow water equations) in two and three spatial dimensions. We prove that, for a general class of spherically symmetric initial density: $\rho_0^{\beta}\in H^3$ with $\beta\in (\frac{1}{3},\gamma-1]$ ($\gamma$: adiabatic exponent) vanishing on the moving boundary in the form of a distance function, no vacuum forms inside the fluid in finite time, and we establish the global well-posedness of classical solutions with large initial data. Particularly, when $\beta=\gamma-1$, the initial density contains a physical vacuum, but fails to satisfy the condition required for the Bresch-Desjardins (BD) entropy estimate when $\gamma\ge 2$. Our analysis is mainly based on a region-segmentation method: near the origin, we develop an interior BD entropy estimate, thereby obtaining flow-map-weighted estimates for the density; while, near the boundary, we construct $\rho_0$-weighted estimates for the effective velocity, which differ fundamentally from the classical BD entropy estimates and yield novel flow-map-weighted estimates for both the fluid and the effective velocities. These estimates enable us to obtain the uniform upper bound for the density and show that no cavitation occurs inside the fluid. The methodology developed here should also be useful for solving other related nonlinear equations involving similar difficulties.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06233v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Exoplanet atmosphere characterization has seen revolutionary advances over the last few years, providing us with unique insights into atmospheric chemistry, dynamics and planet formation mechanisms. However, true solar system analog planets remain inaccessible. A major goal for exoplanet science over the coming decades is to observe, and characterize, temperate rocky planets and cool gas giants in orbit around solar-type stars, with the prospect of detecting signs of habitability or even life. Characterization and categorization of these planets relies on direct spectroscopic observations capable of identifying molecular species in their atmospheres; however, these observations represent a substantial engineering challenge due to the extreme contrast between a temperate, Earth-sized exoplanet and its parent star. NASA&#x27;s next flagship mission, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) - planned for launch in the mid-2040s - will boast a coronagraphic instrument capable of reaching the needed 10$^{-10}$ contrast, on an ultrastable platform enabling long integration times to achieve the required signal to noise. HWO will cover near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared wavelengths, enabling detections of key biosignature molecules and habitability indicators such as ocean glint and a vegetation `red edge&#x27;. Via early involvement in this groundbreaking observatory, including a potential UK instrument contribution, the UK exoplanet community now has an important opportunity to influence the telescope&#x27;s design. To maintain our international competitiveness, we must be at the forefront of observational campaigns with HWO when it eventually launches, and this comes with the need for parallel development in laboratory astrophysics and computational modelling. Maximising our exploitation of this transformative NASA mission requires consistent financial support in these areas across the next two decades.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> JCMT sub-mm observations of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS set early upper limits on HCN and CO production and infer a steep heliocentric-distance dependence for HCN, providing indirect context for the availability of prebiotic feedstock molecules like HCN in extrasolar comet-like bodies.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.02106v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs), particularly those with cometary activity, provide unique insight into the primordial physical and chemical conditions present during the formation of the planetary system in which they originated. Observations in the sub-mm regime allow for direct measurements of several parent molecules released from the comet nucleus into the coma. Here we present observations of the third ISO, 3I/ATLAS, with the `\=U`\=u heterodyne receiver on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), which targeted emission from HCN($J = 3 - 2$) and CO($J = 2 - 1$). Our observations, taken between 16 July 2025 and 21 July 2025 (UT), when 3I/ATLAS was at a heliocentric distance between 4.01 and 3.84 au, provide the earliest sub-mm constraints on its activity. We do not detect HCN or CO in these epochs, with 3$\sigma$ upper-limits on the production rates of $Q(HCN) &lt; 1.7 \times 10^{24}$ s$^{-1}$ at $r_h = 4.01 - 3.97$ au and $Q(CO) &lt; 1.1 \times 10^{27}$ s$^{-1}$ at $r_h = 3.94 - 3.84$ au, respectively. We combine this HCN limit with later JCMT observations of HCN to constrain its temporal evolution. Fitting the HCN detections with a $Q(HCN) \propto r_h^{-n}$ model and accounting for the upper-limits yields $n = 12.7^{+6.9}_{-2.5}$. This slope is steeper than those of typical Solar System comets, but consistent with the production rate slopes measured for other species in the coma of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

We show, using Monte Carlo simulations, that taking into account how water at the protein interface changes its hydrogen bond properties and its density fluctuations is enough to predict protein stability regions with elliptic shapes in the temperature-pressure plane, consistent with previous theories. Our results clearly identify the different mechanisms with which water participates to denaturation and open the perspective to develop advanced computational design tools for protein engineering.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07719v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) is a central tool for studying the dynamical electronic structure of molecules and solids, yet aspects of its mathematical foundations remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we revisit the foundations of TDDFT within a finite-dimensional setting by developing a general geometric framework for Schr\&quot;odinger dynamics subject to prescribed expectation values of selected observables. We show that multiple natural definitions of such constrained dynamics arise from the underlying geometry of the state manifold. The conventional TDDFT formulation emerges from demanding stationarity of the action functional, while an alternative, purely geometric construction leads to a distinct form of constrained Schr\&quot;odinger evolution that has not been previously explored. This alternative dynamics may provide a more mathematically robust route to TDDFT and may suggest new strategies for constructing nonadiabatic approximations. Applying the theory to interacting fermions on finite lattices, we derive novel Kohn--Sham schemes in which the density constraint is enforced via an imaginary potential or, equivalently, a nonlocal Hermitian operator. Numerical illustrations for the Hubbard dimer demonstrate the behavior of these new approaches.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07583v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Nonequilibrium electronic forces play a central role in voltage-driven phase transitions but are notoriously expensive to evaluate in dynamical simulations. Here we develop a machine learning framework for adiabatic lattice dynamics coupled to nonequilibrium electrons, and demonstrate it for a gating induced insulator to metal transition out of a charge density wave state in the Holstein model. Although exact electronic forces can be obtained from nonequilibrium Green&#x27;s function (NEGF) calculations, their high computational cost renders long time dynamical simulations prohibitively expensive. By exploiting the locality of the electronic response, we train a neural network to directly predict instantaneous local electronic forces from the lattice configuration, thereby bypassing repeated NEGF calculations during time evolution. When combined with Brownian dynamics, the resulting machine learning force field quantitatively reproduces domain wall motion and nonequilibrium phase transition dynamics obtained from full NEGF simulations, while achieving orders of magnitude gains in computational efficiency. Our results establish direct force learning as an efficient and accurate approach for simulating nonequilibrium lattice dynamics in driven quantum materials.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> The paper introduces a modified Moran process where “replacer” mutants avoid wasted reproduction by preferentially replacing other types, showing substantially increased fixation and invasion resistance—results broadly relevant to evolutionary dynamics but only indirectly to Origins of Life.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.04417v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Evolution occurs in populations of reproducing individuals. In stochastic descriptions of evolutionary dynamics, such as the Moran process, individuals are chosen randomly for birth and for death. If the same type is chosen for both steps, then the reproductive event is wasted, because the composition of the population remains unchanged. Here we introduce a new phenotype, which we call a replacer. Replacers are efficient competitors. When a replacer is chosen for reproduction, the offspring will always replace an individual of another type (if available). We determine the selective advantage of replacers in well-mixed populations and on one-dimensional lattices. We find that being a replacer substantially boosts the fixation probability of neutral and deleterious mutants. In particular, fixation probability of a single neutral replacer who invades a well-mixed population of size $N$ is of the order of $1/\sqrt N$ rather than the standard $1/N$. Even more importantly, replacers are much better protected against invasions once they have reached fixation. Therefore, replacers dominate the mutation selection equilibrium even if the phenotype of being a replacer comes at a substantial cost: curiously, for large population size and small mutation rate the relative fitness of a successful replacer can be as low as $1/e$.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06510v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Heterogeneous nucleation is the main path to ice formation on Earth. The ice nucleating ability of a certain substrate is mainly determined by both molecular interactions and the structural mismatch between the ice and the substrate lattices. We focus on the latter factor using molecular simulations of the mW model. Quantifying the effect of structural mismatch alone is challenging due to its coupling with molecular interactions. To disentangle both factors, we use a substrate composed of water molecules in such a way that any variation on the nucleation temperature can be exclusively ascribed to the structural mismatch. We find that a one per cent increase of structural mismatch leads to a decrease of approximately 4 K in the nucleation temperature. We also analyse the effect of the orientation of the substrate with respect to the liquid. The three main ice orientations (basal, primary prism and secondary prism) have a similar ice nucleating ability. We finally asses the effect of lattice flexibility by comparing substrates where molecules are immobile with others where a certain freedom to fluctuate around the lattice positions is allowed. Interestingly, we find that the latter type of substrate is more efficient in nucleating ice because it can adapt its structure to that of ice.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07680v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Magnesium (Mg) has mechanical properties similar to bone tissue, and Mg ions take part in the metabolism. This makes Mg of interest for biocompatible degradable body implants, provided that its high corrosion rate can be inhibited. Slightly alloying Mg and adding surface coatings can slow down the corrosion processes without significantly changing the mechanical properties. Use of coating molecules that are native to the body increase the likelihood of making the surface biocompatible, for example by use of amino acids. We here present a density functional theory (DFT) study of the adsorption on Mg(0001) of the amino acids glycine, L-proline, and L-hydroxyproline (Hyp), the main amino acid content of collagen.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07719v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) is a central tool for studying the dynamical electronic structure of molecules and solids, yet aspects of its mathematical foundations remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we revisit the foundations of TDDFT within a finite-dimensional setting by developing a general geometric framework for Schr\&quot;odinger dynamics subject to prescribed expectation values of selected observables. We show that multiple natural definitions of such constrained dynamics arise from the underlying geometry of the state manifold. The conventional TDDFT formulation emerges from demanding stationarity of the action functional, while an alternative, purely geometric construction leads to a distinct form of constrained Schr\&quot;odinger evolution that has not been previously explored. This alternative dynamics may provide a more mathematically robust route to TDDFT and may suggest new strategies for constructing nonadiabatic approximations. Applying the theory to interacting fermions on finite lattices, we derive novel Kohn--Sham schemes in which the density constraint is enforced via an imaginary potential or, equivalently, a nonlocal Hermitian operator. Numerical illustrations for the Hubbard dimer demonstrate the behavior of these new approaches.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06995v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The distribution of ions and their impact on the structure of electrolyte interfaces plays an important role in many applications. Interestingly, recent experimental studies have suggested the preferential accumulation of $SO_4^{2-}$ ions at the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interface in disagreement with the generally known tendency of cations to accumulate at graphene-electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we resolve the atomistic structure of the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interfaces in the 0.1-2.0 M concentration range using machine learning interatomic potential-based simulations and simulated sum frequency generation (SFG) spectra to reveal the molecular origins of the conundrum. Our results show that Na+ ions accumulate between the outermost and second water layers whereas $SO_4^{2-}$ ions accumulate within the second interfacial water layer indicating cation dominated interfaces. We find that the interfacial region (within ~10 ${\AA}$ of the graphene sheet) is negatively charged due to sub-stoichiometric $Na^+$/$SO_4^{2-}$ ratio at the interface. Our simulated SFG spectra show enhancement and a red-shift of the spectra in the hydrogen bonded region as a function of $Na_2SO_4$ concentration similar to measurements due to $SO_4^{2-}$-induced changes in the orientational order of water molecules in the second interfacial layer. Our study demonstrates that ion stratification and ion-induced water reorganization are key elements of understanding the electrolyte-graphene interface.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07409v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Janus particles, with their intrinsic asymmetry, are attracting major interest in various applications, including emulsion stabilization, micro/nanomotors, imaging, and drug delivery. In this context, Janus polymersomes are particularly attractive for synthetic cell development and drug delivery systems. While they can be achieved by inducing a phase separation within their membrane, their fabrication method remains largely empirical. Here, we propose a rational approach, using Flory-Huggins theory, to predict the self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers into asymmetric Janus polymersomes. Our predictions are experimentally validated by forming highly stable Janus giant unilamellar vesicles (JGUVs) with a remarkable yield exceeding 90% obtained from electroformation of various biocompatible block copolymers. We also present a general phase diagram correlating mixing energy with polymersome morphology, offering a valuable tool for JGUV design. These polymersomes can be extruded to achieve quasi-monodisperse vesicles while maintaining their Janus-like morphology, paving the way for their asymmetric functionalization and use as active carriers.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06089v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Understanding how biological soft matter responds to electromagnetic fields under ambient conditions remains a central challenge, as thermal fluctuations are generally expected to suppress long-range organization. Here, we report that hydrated DNA exhibits a reproducible magnetic-field-induced transition characterized by a sharp transverse-voltage threshold (40-50 mV), followed by a regime of regular, phase-stable oscillations in the transverse polarization signal. These features emerge only beyond the threshold and display a pronounced temperature dependence, consistent with the formation of a collective mode within the hydrogen-bond network of the DNA-water interface. Motivated by recent studies of Hall-like responses carried by neutral excitations, including phonons, magnons, and excitons, we interpret the observed transverse signal in terms of coherent polarization dynamics of proton-proton-hole dipoles confined to a quasi-two-dimensional hydrated layer. Within this framework, the transverse response is attributed to a field-organized polarization mode; the measured transverse voltage arises from collective dipolar dynamics rather than steady carrier transport. These results identify hydrated DNA as a soft-matter system in which magnetic field and temperature jointly modulate collective polarization dynamics, providing a biologically relevant platform for exploring coherence and transverse responses in hydrogen-bonded media.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Excited-state molecular dynamics reveals ultrafast pathways by which UV-irradiated liquid water generates hydrated electrons (and associated ion–radical pairs), a mechanistic advance relevant to prebiotic redox chemistry though not directly focused on specific origins-of-life systems.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2508.19702v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The photophysics and photochemistry associated with irradiating UV light in liquid water is central to numerous physical, chemical and biological processes. One of the key events involved in this process is the generation of the hydrated electron. Despite long study from both experimental and theoretical fronts, a unified understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with the generation of the solvated electron have remained elusive. Here, using excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of condensed phase photoexcited liquid water, we unravel the key sequence of chemical events leading to the creation of the hydrated electron on the excited state. The process begins through the excitation localized mostly on specific topological defects in the hydrogen-bond network of water which is subsequently followed by two main reaction pathways. The first, leads to the creation of a hydrogen atom culminating in non-radiative decay back to the ground-state within 100 femtoseconds. The second involves a proton coupled electron transfer, giving rise to the formation of the hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical and the hydrated excess electron on the excited-state. This process is facilitated by ultrafast coupled rotational and translational motions of water molecules leading to the formation of water mediated ion-radical pairs in the network. These species can survive on the picosecond timescale and ultimately modulate the emission of visible photons. All in all, our findings provide fresh perspectives into the interpretation of several independent time-dependent spectroscopies measured over the last decades, paving the way for new directions on both theoretical and experimental fronts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:1505.07594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: The mechanisms of cold- and pressure-denaturation of proteins are matter of debate and are commonly understood as due to water-mediated interactions. Here we study several cases of proteins, with or without a unique native state, with or without hydrophilic residues, by means of a coarse-grain protein model in explicit solvent. We show, using Monte Carlo simulations, that taking into account how water at the protein interface changes its hydrogen bond properties and its density fluctuations is enough to predict protein stability regions with elliptic shapes in the temperature-pressure plane, consistent with previous theories. Our results clearly identify the different mechanisms with which water participates to denaturation and open the perspective to develop advanced computational design tools for protein engineering.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2509.16257v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Stress, or pressure, is a central quantity in engineering and remains vital in molecular modelling. However, the commonly used virial stress tensor is invalid for an inhomogeneous fluid, which is essential in fluid dynamics and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation. This is solved by using the method of planes (MoP), a mechanical form of pressure, simply interpreted as the force divided by area, yet is derived from the firm foundations of statistical mechanics. We present an extension of MoP stress1 to the MACE potential, a particular form of machine learning (ML) potentials allowing the incorporation of quantum mechanical (QM) physics into classical simulation. We present the derivation of this local stress for the MACE potential using the theoretical framework set out by Irving and Kirkwood 2 . For the test case of an interface between water and Zirconium Oxide, we show that the MoP measures the correct force balance while the virial form fails. Further, we demonstrate that this planar definition of stress is valid arbitrarily far from equilibrium, showing exact conservation every timestep in a control volume bounded by MoP planes. This links the stress directly to the conservation equations and demonstrates the validity in non equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) systems. All code to reproduce these validations for any MACE system, together with ASE accelerated code to calculate the MoP, is provided as open source. This work helps build the foundation to extend the ML revolution in materials to NEMD and molecular fluid dynamics modelling.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.14201v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Ultrafast charge transfer (CT) processes redistribute electronic charge within and between molecular units and play a central role in many physical, chemical, and biological phenomena. However, the microscopic pathways of multiple CT events, including the coupled structural evolution and energy redistribution, are challenging to disentangle experimentally in complex systems. To obtain controlled insight into such dynamics, well-defined properties are required. Here, we investigate the N2Ar dimer, which combines a covalent bond with a weak van der Waals interaction, using site-selective synchrotron photoionization and coincident detection of electrons and ions. Combined with ab initio calculations, this approach enables step-by-step tracking of ultrafast CT and fragmentation dynamics. We find that the dimer&#x27;s structural evolution triggers a second CT event, opening complex reaction pathways in which electrons are transferred back and forth between Ar and N2, through two nonadiabatic transitions involving conical intersections. These results demonstrate that sequential multiple CT-induced transitions, even in a simple dimer, provide controlled insight into nonadiabatic reaction mechanisms relevant to complex systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07457v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Small aromatic molecules, including functionalized derivatives of benzene, are known to be present throughout the different stages of star and planet formation. In particular, oxygen-bearing monosubstituted aromatics, likely including phenol, have been identified in the coma of comet 67P. This suggests that, earlier in the star and planet formation evolution, icy grains may act as both reservoirs and sites of functionalization for these small aromatics. We investigate the ice-phase reactivity of singlet oxygen atoms (O($^1$D)) with benzene, using ozone as a precursor that is readily photodissociated by relatively low-energy. Our experiments show that O($^1$D) efficiently reacts with benzene, forming phenol, benzene oxide, and oxepine as the main products. Phenol formation is temperature-independent, consistent with a barrierless insertion mechanism. In contrast, the formation of benzene oxide/oxepine shows a slight temperature dependence, suggesting that additional reaction pathways involving either ground-state or excited-state oxygen atoms may contribute. In H$_2$O and \COO ice matrices we find that dilution does not suppress formation of phenol. We extrapolate an experimental upper limit for the benzene-to-phenol conversion fraction of 27-44$\%$ during the lifetime of an interstellar cloud, assuming O($^1$D) production rates based on CO$_2$ ice abundances and a cosmic-ray induced UV field. We compare these estimates with a new analysis of data from the comet 67P, where the C$_6$H$_6$O/C$_6$H$_6$ ratio is 20$\pm$6$\%$. This value lies within our estimated range, suggesting that O($^1$D)-mediated chemistry is a viable pathway for producing oxygenated aromatics in cold astrophysical ices, potentially enriching icy planetesimals with phenol and other biorelevant compounds.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2505.23460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) manifests as a forward-backward asymmetry of electron emission in the direction orthogonal to the light polarization plane via one-photon ionization of chiral molecules with circularly polarized light. Multi-polar `PECD&#x27; currents, i.e., currents resolved along multiple directions, have also been predicted using two mutually-orthogonal linearly polarized light with carrier frequencies $\omega$ and $2\omega$. These currents arise from the interference between the one- and two-photon transitions. Here, we will show that photoelectron spin detection already reveals enantio-sensitive multi-polar currents in the one-photon regime since the two axes can be marked by the photoelectron momentum $\unitvec{k}$ and spin-detection axis $\unitvec{s}$. Specifically, we consider one-photon ionization of an isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules and show that the direction of the resulting photoelectron current is enantio-sensitively `locked&#x27; to the photoelectron&#x27;s spin, which is mediated by two mechanisms. First, is the Bloch pseudovector which enables a collinear locking forming either a spin-sink or source for opposite enantiomers. Second, is the spin torque pseudovector that enables orthogonal locking forming a spin vortex in the polarization plane that rotates in opposite directions for opposite enantiomers. The former effect is a spin analog of photoelectron vortex dichroism (\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.233201}{Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{129}, 233201, 2022}) wherein the detected photoelectron spin encodes molecular chirality while the latter is reminiscent of the Rashba effect in solids</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) serves as a mechanism to suppress the expression of mutant alleles containing premature termination codons, limit the expression of aberrantly spliced transcript isoforms, and control the expression of numerous regular genes. While the principles by which NMD recognizes target transcripts are well understood, much less is known about the range of mRNAs subject to NMD in tissues and specialized cell types. Here we describe the landscape of genes whose expression is controlled by NMD in cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-CM), using small read RNA sequencing in combination with a potent inhibitor of SMG1, a kinase essential for NMD. We find that NMD targets are highly conserved between iPSC-CM lines derived from two healthy individuals. Beyond gene level analysis, we identify individual exon and intron RNA sequences that strongly accumulate upon SMG1 inhibition. Using the cardiac NMD targets identified at gene, exon and intron level, we then demonstrate reduced NMD efficiency upon knockdown of two essential NMD factors, UPF1 and UPF2, in iPSC-CM. Our analysis demonstrates that quantifying the transcriptome-wide response to SMG1 inhibition represents a highly sensitive approach to assess global activity of the NMD pathway.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mitochondria possess their own mRNA translation system, mediated by specialized mitoribosomes. Dysregulation of mitochondrial translation disrupts metabolic homeostasis and is linked to various pathologies, including metabolic syndromes, neurological disorders, and cardiac diseases. Using CRISPR/Cas9 screening, we identified EOLA1 (endothelial-overexpressed lipopolysaccharide-associated factor 1) as a novel mitochondrial matrix protein essential for metabolic homeostasis. Knockout of Eola1 severely affects mitochondrial translation and consequently the oxidative phosphorylation in mammalian cells. Mechanistically, EOLA1 physically interacts with mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA (12S mt-rRNA) and the mitochondrial Tu translation elongation factor (TUFM), facilitating efficient translation elongation of mitochondrial-encoded mRNAs. Furthermore, genetic ablation of Eola1 in mice induced severe cardiac dysfunction, demonstrating its indispensable role in maintaining heart function through mitochondrial translation control. Together, our findings establish EOLA1 as a key regulator of mitochondrial translation via its interactions with 12S mt-rRNA and TUFM, highlighting its importance in cellular metabolism and a potential role in cardiac disease pathogenesis.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Circadian clocks in eukaryotes rely on precisely regulated negative feedback loops to generate daily rhythms. However, the delay mechanisms that extend this structurally simple feedback loop to ~24 hours are not yet fully understood. In the filamentous fungal model organism Neurospora crassa, the negative arm complex, centered by FREQUENCY (FRQ), must enter the nucleus to repress the White Collar Complex (WCC) and close the feedback loop, but the mechanisms and dynamics of its nuclear transport have remained unresolved. Using long-term live-cell imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we demonstrate that FRQ nuclear import is an active circadian-regulated process that is fastest early in the subjective day and progressively decreases as nuclear FRQ approaches peak levels, corresponding to altered direct binding between FRQ and Importin . We further establish that Importin is required for the spatial regulation of FRQ and WC-1 and the correct timing of Neurospora circadian clock. Analysis of the three Neurospora Importin {beta} homologs reveals that each of them contributes differently to the circadian clock through pathways beyond FRQ or WCC nuclear import. More specifically, we find a genetic interaction between Imp{beta}3 and the phosphatase PP-4. Together, these findings indicate that nuclear import is a selective, dynamic, and rate-limiting regulatory step in the fungal circadian clock and reveal both conserved and fungal-specific mechanisms by which importins tune circadian timing.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Coarse-grained molecular dynamics study of how the histone PTM H2BK108Me2 alters nucleosome DNA end closure to suppress Cebpa transcription and reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis in type 2 diabetes, with minimal relevance to origins-of-life research beyond general DNA/chromatin biophysics.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a serious metabolic disorder characterised by hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance. An increased rate of hepatic gluconeogenesis acts as one of the major contributors of the high blood glucose levels in the diseased condition. Transcriptional regulation is a main factor that controls gene expression. In this study we have elucidated how the transcriptional availability of the Cebpa gene can be modulated at the nucleosomal level through the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones using a series of coarse-grained multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations. The transcriptional status of a gene is influenced by a plethora of factors, but our work reveals that indeed histone PTMs are capable of modulating transcriptional output of genes at a structural level, independent of other regulatory factors. We have identified H2BK108Me2, a downregulated histone PTM mark found in a diet-induced obese mouse liver, to be essentially contributing in tackling gluconeogenic load by suppressing transcription of the Cebpa gene. We found that H2BK108Me2 induces the closure of the nucleosomal DNA ends through sliding and posing chromatin unavailability towards essential transcription factors of the gene.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Biophysical and structural analysis suggests phosphorylation-dependent intramolecular looping in the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein toggles compaction, self-association, and RNA/nucleic-acid binding, impacting RNP formation.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 scaffolds genomic RNA into ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNP) for assembly in the virion, but also fulfills critical intracellular functions in replication and the suppression of host defense. It contains a folded nucleic acid binding domain (NTD) and a dimerization domain, connected by a disordered linker containing a serine/arginine-rich (SR) region and a leucine-rich sequence (LRS). The switch between intracellular and assembly functions is controlled by phosphorylation of the SR region, but the molecular details are unclear. Here we describe a model in which two mutually exclusive intramolecular loops bind the NTD and dynamically control self-association and nucleic acid binding properties dependent on the SR linker phosphorylation state. The model is supported by biophysical measurements of hydrodynamic radii, reversible protein self-association, nucleic acid binding, and thermodynamic stability, as well as structural predictions and published NMR chemical shifts. We find SR linker phosphorylation compacts the protein and inhibits nucleic acid binding and RNP formation, while enhancing self-association through promotion of transient coiled-coils in the LRS of the linker. These changes shift the nucleocapsid protein to a configuration poised for multi-valent interactions that support intracellular functions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Gene duplication has played a critical role in the evolutionary history of proteins, enabling complex multimers to emerge from simpler precursors. Yet in protein engineering, current methods for directed evolution do not exploit gene duplication, hampering access to the vast array of diverse variants that are only enriched in the presence of a wild-type copy. We establish a directed evolution strategy for multimeric proteins that harnesses gene duplication to compensate for metabolic burden and self-assembly fitness, allowing previously inaccessible variants to be enriched. Starting from a homomeric 240-mer capsid, gene duplication enables selection of both extreme homomeric variants and obligate heteromers. This strategy significantly expands engineering access to diverse high-performing variants, while also supporting a plausible model for evolutionary diversification of higher-order multimers in nature.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recruitment dynamics, or the distribution of the number of offspring among individuals, is fundamental to ecology and evolution. We take sweepstakes reproduction to mean a skewed (heavy right-tailed) offspring number distribution without natural selection being involved. Sweepstakes may be generated by chance matching of reproduction with favorable environmental conditions. Gene genealogies generated by sweepstakes reproduction are in the domain of attraction of multiple-merger coalescents where a random number of lineages merges at such times. We consider population genetic models of sweepstakes reproduction for haploid panmictic populations of both constant (N), and varying population size, and evolving in a random environment. We construct our models so that we can recover the observed number of new mutations in a given sample without requiring strong assumptions regarding the population size or the mutation rate. Our main results are (i) continuous-time coalescents that are either the Kingman coalescent or specific families of Beta- or Poisson-Dirichlet coalescents; when combining the results the parameter of the Beta-coalescent ranges from 0 to 2, and the Beta-coalescents may be incomplete due to an upper bound on the number of potential offspring an arbitrary individual may produce; (ii) in large populations we measure time in units proportional to either N/log N or N generations; (iii) incorporating fluctuations in population size leads to time-changed multiple-merger coalescents where the time-change does not depend on ; (iv) using simulations we show that in some cases approximations of functionals of a given coalescent do not match the ones of the ancestral process in the domain of attraction of the given coalescent; (v) approximations of functionals obtained by conditioning on the population ancestry (the ancestral relations of all gene copies at all times) are broadly similar (for the models considered here) to the approximations obtained without conditioning on the population ancestry.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The early branching eukaryotic parasite, Trypanosoma brucei, lives extracellularly in the mammalian host, where it expresses variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). Antigenic variation of VSGs allows the parasite to evade the host immune response while in the bloodstream. Upon transition to the tsetse fly vector, the parasite remodels its surface to express procyclin protein from a limited set of EP and GPEET genes. While the environmental signals that trigger the switch from expressing VSG genes to expressing EP and GPEET genes are known, the molecular mechanism that initiates transcription of the EP and GPEET genes during parasite differentiation to the procyclic stage within the tsetse is not well understood. Previous work has shown that the chromatin interacting bromodomain protein Bdf3 is absent from the pol I promoter of the EPlocus in bloodstream parasites, but appears there shortly after initiation of differentiation from the bloodstream to the procyclic stage. Here, we show that tethering of Bdf3 to the EP promoter using a dCas9-Bdf3 fusion protein and a guide RNA is sufficient to increase transcript levels of EP1 in bloodstream parasites, where the gene is normally silenced. This result supports the model that Bdf3 appears at the EP locus during differentiation to facilitate initiation of transcription, which is consistent with the role for Bdf3 as a transcriptional activator in other systems. Understanding gene regulatory mechanisms in this early branching eukaryote may help build a more complete picture for the conserved and unique features of gene regulatory proteins across diverse biological systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are key regulators of gene expression and often contain intrinsically disordered regions that drive biomolecular condensation. Yet, how condensation affects RBP specificity and function remains poorly defined. Here, we use strategically designed point mutations to selectively impair canonical RNA-binding and condensation of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked RBP Fused in Sarcoma (FUS). Using automated high-content imaging, we show that both properties shape nuclear ribonucleoprotein condensates and govern distinct aspects of FUS function in the DNA damage response. Transcriptome-wide mapping of FUS-RNA interactions reveals that the canonical RNA-binding domains recognise G-rich and C-rich motifs, whereas condensation selectively enhances binding to G-rich and structured sequences, often acting in concert with canonical RNA-binding to control transcriptional programs and splicing decisions. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for how FUS integrates condensation with sequence-specific RNA recognition to orchestrate nuclear organisation, genome stability and RNA metabolism. Furthermore, our rigorously validated mutants offer a platform for future mechanistic dissection of ALS pathogenesis and the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Using high-coverage family genomics, this preprint maps sex-specific crossover and non-crossover recombination hotspots in coppery titi monkeys, informing primate molecular evolution but offering minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Along with germline mutations, meiotic recombination plays a fundamental role in shaping genetic diversity and thus directly influences a species&#x27; potential adaptive response to environmental change, amongst other features. Despite the recombination landscape being of central importance for a variety of questions in molecular evolution, the genome-wide distribution and frequency of recombination remains to be elucidated in many non-human primate species. Utilizing novel high-coverage genomic data from three multi-sibling families, we here provide the first estimates of the rates and patterns of crossover and non-crossover recombination in coppery titi monkeys (Plecturocebus cupreus) - a socially monogamous, pair-bonded primate that serves as an important model in behavioral research. Consistent with haplorrhines, crossover and non-crossover recombination in this platyrrhine are frequently localized at PRDM9-mediated hotspots, characterized by a 15-mer binding motif with substantial similarities to the degenerate 13-mer motif found in humans. The sex-averaged crossover rate in coppery titi monkeys is comparable with those of other primates; however, no significant difference in recombination rates was observed between the sexes, despite a pronounced maternal age effect in the species. Similarities also exist with regards to the sex-specific genomic distribution of non-crossover events, though the minimal conversion tract lengths of extended events was observed to be considerably longer in maternally-inherited non-crossovers. Taken together, these similarities and differences in the recombination landscape relative to other primates highlight the importance of incorporating species-specific rates and patterns in evolutionary models, and the resources provided here will thus serve to aid future studies in this important primate model system.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids have shown great promise as delivery vectors for gene therapy. However, the natural properties of AAV capsids impose significant limitations on their efficacy. While capsid library screening and directed evolution have facilitated the development of improved vectors, current methods for generating AAV libraries frequently yield nonviable variants that fail to assemble or package DNA. Here, we propose a viability-guided diffusion model AAVDiffusion for de novo viable AAV capsid design. AAVDiffusion iteratively denoises Gaussian vectors into vectors of AAV capsid protein sequences, yielding intermediate latent variables. By leveraging the continuous nature of these latent variables, AAVDiffusion integrates an additional viability classifier that applies gradient updates to enhance the generation of viable AAV sequences. Through extensive computational tests, AAVDiffusion exhibits superior performance in generating viable AAV sequences. Furthermore, 196 AAV candidates were identified through a selection workflow, with the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier, thereby offering safer and more effective gene therapies for brain diseases. AAVDiffusion offers a powerful and efficient computational method for designing viable AAV capsids, advancing the development of AAV vectors for gene therapy.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Using inbreeding-derived autozygous segments, this study estimates an elevated germline DNA mutation rate in the tiny, isolated Devils Hole pupfish, lending support (at an extreme) to the drift-barrier hypothesis for mutation-rate evolution.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mutation rates vary by three orders of magnitude across eukaryotes. The drift-barrier hypothesis proposes that drift overwhelms selection for lower mutation rates in small populations, leading to higher mutation rates over time due to gradual accumulation of mutator alleles. Here, we test this hypothesis in the smallest long-term isolated population in the world, the critically endangered Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis). We estimated germline mutation rates in embryonic lethal and adult populations using autozygous segments caused by recent inbreeding events. Our estimate, 8.09 x 10^(-9) per base pair per generation, is significantly higher than the average rate for actinopterygian fishes of 5.97 x 10^(-9) (95% CI = 4.39 x 10^(-9)- 7.55 x 10^(-9)) and is lower than expected but still consistent with predictions from the drift-barrier hypothesis of 1.23 x 10^(-8) (95% CI = 7.81 x 10^(-9)- 1.93 x 10^(-8)), based on a recent meta-analysis of vertebrate mutation rates by Bergeron et al. (2023). We find that embryonic lethal individuals have a higher mutation rate than mature adults, potentially reflecting a segregating lethal mutator allele or damage to the cellular environment during embryo death. We also analyzed the mutational spectra of germline mutations and find that spectra between embryonic lethal and mature adults were similar, as is the spectra in Devils Hole pupfish and other fishes, despite differences in environmental temperature and oxygen stresses. Mutation rates in this critically endangered species provide new insights at one extreme into the mechanisms driving mutation rate variation across vertebrates.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Coarse-grained simulations extend Helical Coherence Theory to flexible, confined dsDNA and show that confinement and ionic conditions can promote protein-independent homologous DNA pairing with microsecond kinetics and distinct fraying/bubble formation modes.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> How can protein-independent, side-by-side alignment of homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) arise as an early step in genome repair and genetic exchange, and what determines their kinetics under confinement? Although recombination proteins are known to facilitate this process, experiments indicate that an initial side-by-side arrangement of homologs can occur even in their absence. Helical Coherence Theory (HCT) proposes that sequence-dependent distortions of the double helix lead to commensurate charge patterns between interacting dsDNAs, favouring homologous over non-homologous alignment. However, HCT has largely been developed for straight, rigid dsDNA rods, an approximation limited to roughly one persistence length (lB {approx} 50 nm), leaving the question open as to how recognition manifests in longer, fluctuating chains. Moreover, the dynamics and timescales of homolog searching under confinement, and the internal dynamics of the paired state, such as transient formation of local unpaired regions (&quot;bubbles&#x27;&#x27;) and end fraying, remain unexplored. Here we extend HCT to dsDNA chains of multiple persistence lengths under confinement using coarse-grained simulations with a custom HCT-based force field, in order to come closer to understanding how homologous genes pair in vivo. We simulate two homologous chains within spherical cavities of radii 0.3-1 times their free-space gyration radius under two limiting ionic conditions. We found that confinement warrants homologous pairing; it occurs on microsecond timescales and depends non-monotonically on confinement size, with an optimal confinement that accelerates pairing while avoiding tangled states and metastable trapping in an ion-dependent manner. To resolve pairing dynamics, we develop a kinetic theory and fit it to simulation trajectories, distinguishing rates of independent pairing modes underlying bubble formation and fraying. Together, these results support a physical mechanism for homologous pairing beyond the rigid-rod limit and suggest how confinement can promote both encounter and stabilisation within the HCT framework.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Demonstrates fully programmable, reversible control of macroscopic helicity in dopant-free inorganic self-assembly via airflow shear, offering a useful physical model for studying how chiral organization could emerge without biological templating.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We report the controlled synthesis of fully programmable macroscopic chirality in hierarchical inorganic assemblies through the introduction of directional spiral airflow during evaporation-induced self-assembly of sub-1 nm gadolinium oxyhydroxide (GdOOH) nanowires. Extending previous observation of spontaneous centimeter-scale macroscopic helical assemblies (MHAs) without chiral dopants and with random handedness, we demonstrated 100% deterministic control over helicity, with left- or right-handed structures formation depending on the direction of airflow. This effect is independent of gas composition, confirming a purely mechanical shear-driven mechanism. Moreover, the resulting MHAs can be readily dissolved to regenerate the homogenous nanowire dispersion, allowing repeated cycles of assembly with inverted handedness and creating true dynamic programmability in a dopant-free inorganic system. This simple yet strong approach overcomes the random nature of macroscopic inorganic chirality, revealing supramolecular-like reversibility. These findings open new pathways for engineerable chiroptical materials with potential applications in photonics, catalysis, and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Zebrafish and medaka are powerful cardiovascular models, yet cellular and molecular investigations of adult heart cells have been constrained by suboptimal dissociation and characterization methods. To overcome these barriers, we developed a physiological-temperature workflow that generates high-yield, viable single-cell suspensions for FACS, imaging, and low-input molecular profiling. Using transgenic fluorescent reporters, we consistently isolate ~6,000 cardiomyocytes per adult zebrafish ventricle and ~12,000 from medaka, preserving cellular, structural, and molecular integrity. Single-cell morphometrics revealed cardiomyocyte heterogeneity and demonstrated that swimming exercise induces both hypertrophy and hyperplasia, while ventricular injury triggers expansion of regenerative gata4 cardiomyocytes. We integrated proteomics and RNA-seq from FACS-purified cells to construct cell-type-specific proteo-transcriptomic atlases. Functional enrichment, transcription factor, and network analyses identified protein hubs and regulatory circuits defining cardiomyocyte and endothelial cell identity. Our platform delivers cell-type-resolved molecular datasets of adult teleost cardiac cells, establishing a systems-level resource for heart regeneration research, cardiovascular disease modeling, and drug discovery.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas and ozone-destroying substance, and lakes contribute variably to its atmospheric budget. We investigated the seasonal variability of N2O cycling in two contrasting basins of Lake Lugano, Switzerland: the meromictic North Basin (NB) and the holomictic South Basin (SB). Over one full seasonal cycle, we measured N2O concentration and site-specific isotopomer compositions to assess spatio-temporal dynamics. Both basins showed near-neutral N2O exchange with the atmosphere, without clear seasonal patterns of N2O emission versus uptake (average air-water exchange flux of 0.04 ± 0.3 µmol m-2 d-1). Keeling-plot analysis indicated a nitrification-driven N2O source in the oxic water column in both basins, as inferred from its position-specific isotopic nitrogen composition. In the anoxic water column in the North Basin, N2O was persistently depleted, whereas in the deep South Basin N2O consumption was observed only during late-stage stratification. Net N2O consumption in the hypolimnia of both basins was accompanied by isotopic shifts toward lighter δ15Nbulk and δ15Nβ values, contrary to trends observed in pure cultures. These inverse apparent isotope effects suggest concurrent N2O production during net consumption. Using a simplified box-model (i.e., isotope mass balance) approach, we estimated that 5-17% of the consumed N2O needed to be replaced by simultaneous N2O production in order to match the observed in situ δ15Nbulk-N2O data. Our findings highlight the complexity of N2O cycling in lake systems and reveal that isotopic overprinting from simultaneous N2O production and consumption can obscure traditional isotope-based interpretations. At the same time, they underscore the value of stable isotopes in disentangling N2O production and consumption mechanisms.</p>

Although a widespread system is characterized by the deposition of multilayer thin-film in the extracellular matrix (ECM), enabling light interference, to date such lamellae have only been described in the cuticle of red algae belonging to the Gigartinaceae family within macroalgae. Here, we determine the composition of the multilayered cuticle components in the model species Chondrus crispus (Rhodophyta), using genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and analytical profiling of carbohydrates. The complex structural assembly revealed common features with the ECM of animals. The carbohydrate fraction consists of a complex mixture of ECM carrageenans and glycosaminoglycan-like structures. A major von Willerbrand factor A domain (VWA) protein plays a critical role for the adhesion of macromolecules, including protein-protein interactions and to sulfated polysaccharides. We propose the name of Lamellae Cohesive Protein (LCP) regarding the alternate distribution of chemically distinct constituents within the cuticle. For the first time, we identified major proteins of the algal cuticle, providing a framework for addressing the evolutionary origins of the algal cuticle biosynthesis and raise important questions regarding its role, particularly across the life cycle marked by major structural ECM modifications.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This preprint reports that extracellular vesicles from BCG-infected macrophages can epigenetically reprogram naive monocytes (via altered DNA methylation) and may modestly enhance in vitro control of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but it has minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a leading cause of death from infectious disease. Infected cells secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs), nanosized membrane-bound particles containing bioactive molecules known to mediate intercellular communication and influence immune regulation during infection. We hypothesized that EVs secreted from Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG)-infected macrophages could epigenetically reprogram naive monocytes and enhance their mycobactericidal activity against Mtb. A transwell co-culture system was used to enable communication via EVs and soluble factors, between BCG-infected macrophages and naive monocytes (recipient macrophages). To assess the impact of these factors, we examined epigenetic reprogramming and the ability to control Mtb growth. BCG-infected macrophages released EVs with a distinct proteomic profile mapping to multiple tuberculosis-related pathways. Recipient macrophages exhibited altered DNA methylation patterns compared to those co-cultured with untreated, Staphylococcus aureus-infected or hydrogen peroxide-exposed macrophages. The proteomic cargo of EVs and differentially methylated genes in recipient cells showed significant interactions with TNF as a central hub enriched in both the phagosome and tuberculosis pathway. The epigenetic reprogramming was accompanied by a trend towards improved control of Mtb in vitro. BCG infection induces release of EVs that, together with soluble factors, induce targeted epigenetic remodeling in recipient macrophages.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Centrosomes are complex organelles that comprise multiple copies of hundreds of different proteins, yet they can precisely duplicate every cell cycle. Here we reconstitute centrosome duplication on synthetic beads programmed to recruit core centrosome assembly proteins when injected into Drosophila embryos. These beads generate structures that are functionally indistinguishable from centrosomes: they recruit centriole/centrosome proteins, organise microtubules (MTs) and proceed through multiple rounds of high-fidelity duplication, all in synchrony with the endogenous centrosomes. The beads function as seeds that recruit biogenesis-promoting proteins to stimulate the assembly of relatively simple scaffolds that direct centrosome self-assembly. This &#x27;&#x27;Seed-Scaffold-Self-Assemble&#x27;&#x27; mechanism may represent a general principle of organelle biogenesis, explaining how simple molecular inputs can generate complex structures without the need to copy a pre-existing template.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> GenCore introduces an efficient Locally Consistent Parsing–based sketching method to estimate genomic distances and reconstruct phylogenies from assemblies or reads, which is broadly relevant to evolutionary genomics but not directly to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In the era of exponential data generation, a fast, consistent, and efficient string processing technique is necessary to represent extensive genomic data. One of the earliest string processing techniques, predating MinHash and minimizer-based sketching, is Locally Consistent Parsing (LCP). This technique partitions an input string and identifies short, exactly occurring substrings called cores, which collectively cover the input string while maintaining Partition and Labeling Consistency. The iterative application of LCP yields progressively longer cores in a compressed format, thereby substantially enhancing the efficiency of genomic sequence representation and subsequent downstream analysis. We have previously developed LCPtools as the first iterative implementation of LCP for the DNA alphabet and demonstrated its effectiveness in identifying cores with minimal collisions. Here, we introduce GenCore, a computational method that leverages LCP cores for the first time to sketch and estimate genomic distances for closely related large genomes, and successfully reconstruct simulated progression trees. GenCore also successfully recapitulates primate phylogeny using both telomere-to-telomere (T2T) assemblies and the PacBio HiFi reads for assembly-free comparisons.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces SCALPEL, a computational pipeline to improve processing and atlas-scale analysis of spatial transcriptomics datasets (e.g., whole mouse brain) via better segmentation, filtering, registration, and imputation, with minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spatial transcriptomics enables the precise mapping of gene expression patterns within tissue architecture, offering unprecedented insights into cellular interactions, tissue heterogeneity, and disease pathology that are unattainable with traditional transcriptomic approaches. We present a tool for processing spatial transcriptomics data, SCALPEL (Spatial Cell Analysis, Labeling, Processing, and Expression Linking). SCALPEL is specifically designed to support the analysis of large, atlas-level datasets. Our new workflow features advanced 3D segmentation optimized for dense and heterogeneous tissues, refined filtering criteria, and transcriptome-based doublet detection to remove low-quality or artifactual cells. Cell type label transfer from existing taxonomies is further improved through updated filtering thresholds. Spatial domain detection is incorporated to capture local transcriptomic organization, and tissue sections are registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework version 3 (CCFv3) for precise anatomical alignment. Genome-wide expression imputation from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) further enriches the dataset. Crucially, we benchmark the performance of this updated pipeline against a previously published version of our whole-mouse-brain (WMB) dataset (Yao et al., 2023b), demonstrating substantial improvements in cell number, expression profile clarity, and spatial registration. These advances provide a robust foundation for downstream spatial analyses and set a new standard for large-scale spatial transcriptomics studies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent advancements in the chemical and biological sciences have revealed admirable success in understanding the phenomenon of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), resulting in coacervation.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> A cell biology/virology study showing specific host potassium ion channels (KCNJ2, KCNJ13, KCNMA1) regulate late-endosomal escape of Bunyamwera virus, with limited direct relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Orthobunyavirus genus within the Peribunyaviridae family of enveloped arthropod-borne negative-sense RNA viruses includes species associated with serious or fatal disease in both animals and humans such as Schmallenberg, La Crosse and Oropouche viruses. Orthobunyaviruses (OBVs) are internalised into cells by endocytosis and release their genomes following fusion with late endosomal (LE) membranes, triggered by low pH of the luminal milieu. There is mounting evidence to suggest OBV endosomal escape is also influenced by potassium ions (K+), which increase in concentration as endosomes mature. Endosomal K+ flux is controlled by cellular K+ channels, and we previously showed that K+ channel blockade using broad spectrum pharmacological inhibition abrogates OBV infection, with virions trapped within the endosomes. However, the K+ channels regulating this process are unknown. Herein, to identify the K+ channels involved, we studied Bunyamwera virus (BUNV), the prototypical OBV, and screened a siRNA library targeting 342 human ion channels. We identified 19 K+ channels whose knockdown inhibited BUNV gene expression by over 50%, with at least seven channels affecting BUNV at the entry stage, suggesting they exert a combinatorial influence. Of these seven channels, we used both pharmacological inhibition and genetic channel manipulation to show that OBV escape from CD63- and Rab7-positive LEs is controlled by KCNJ2 (KIR 2.1), KCNJ13 (KIR7.1) and KCNMA1 (BKCa). These studies add to the understanding of host factors influencing OBV entry, regulation of endosomal ion flux, and could aid in the design or repurposing of therapeutics for the treatment of OBV-associated disease.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study maps how the splicing regulator RBM20 binds long neuronal pre-mRNAs and prevents nonproductive splicing to maintain cytoplasmic mRNA levels, but it is largely unrelated to origins-of-life questions beyond a very general connection to RNA biology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Precise coordination of molecular programs and neuronal growth governs the formation, maintenance, and adaptation of neuronal circuits. RNA metabolism has emerged as a key regulatory node of neural development and nervous system pathologies. To uncover cell-type-specific RNA regulators, we systematically investigated expression of RNA recognition motif-containing proteins in the mouse neocortex. Surprisingly, we found RNA-binding motif protein 20 (RBM20), an alternative splicing regulator associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, to be expressed in cortical parvalbumin interneurons and mitral cells of the olfactory bulb. Genome-wide mapping of RBM20 target mRNAs revealed that neuronal RBM20 binds pre-mRNAs in distal intronic regions. Loss of neuronal RBM20 has only modest impact on alternative splice isoforms but results in a significant reduction in an array of mature mRNAs in the neuronal cytoplasm. This phenotype is particularly pronounced for genes with long introns that encode synaptic proteins. We hypothesize that RBM20 ensures fidelity of pre-mRNA splicing by suppressing nonproductive splicing events in long neuronal genes. This work highlights a common requirement for RBM20-dependent transcriptome regulation in cardiomyocytes and neurons and demonstrates that a major genetic risk factor of heart disease impacts neuronal gene expression.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Histamine receptors (HRH1--HRH4) are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate essential physiological functions, including neurotransmission, gastric acid secretion, immune regulation, and presynaptic autoregulation. Despite their importance, systematic comparative analyses across mammalian histamine receptor sequences remain scarce. In this study, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of HRH1--HRH4 across multiple mammalian species, integrating sequence homology, invariant residue mapping, amino acid substitutions, compositional frequencies, Shannon entropy, polystring distributions, intrinsic disorder profiling, and phylogenetic clustering. HRH2 and HRH1 were highly conserved among primates, HRH3 showed strong cohesion within rodents, while HRH4 exhibited pronounced divergence consistent with immune-related specialization. Invariant residues localized to transmembrane helices and activation motifs (D107, W428/Y431, NPxxY), underscoring strict evolutionary constraints on ligand binding, receptor stability, and G-protein coupling. Substitutions were confined to non-essential lipid-facing and loop regions, predominantly conservative in nature, enabling diversification without disrupting the GPCR fold. Amino acid frequency and entropy analyses revealed hydrophobic dominance with subtype-specific enrichment of polar residues, while disorder profiling identified HRH1 as the most dynamic and HRH2 as the most structurally constrained. Polystring analysis highlighted conserved motifs (WWW, PP) alongside subtype- and species-specific repeats, reflecting evolutionary strategies balancing receptor stability with adaptive flexibility. Phylogenetic clustering confirmed subtype-specific cohesion, with HRH3 and HRH4 forming compact clades, HRH1 showing moderate dispersion, and HRH2 forming the most isolated cluster. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that mammalian histamine receptor evolution is governed by conserved biophysical cores and selective variability, offering insights into structural conservation, functional diversification, and translational relevance for drug design and model selection.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Multiscale simulations offer a way to understand how polymer transformations proceed under realistic conditions, however existing workflows rely on empirically tuned parameters. The MUltiscale SImulation frameworK (MUSIK) integrates conformer analysis, density functional theory and high-level coupled-cluster energetics, and graph-based lattice kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) to generate chemically accurate, spatially and temporally resolved kinetic models for polymer transformations without parameter fitting. The present work introduces MUSIK as a reproducible workflow and provides a step-by-step tutorial that shows how to construct, run, and analyze a lattice kMC model for base-assisted dehydrochlorination of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), supported by post-processing scripts that automate kMC trajectory analysis and polymer-structure reconstruction. Tutorial results demonstrate how MUSIK links atomic energetics and local structure to macroscopic kinetics and structural evolution and reproduces key experimental observations for PVC dehydrochlorination. MUSIK is generalizable to arbitrary polymer chemistries and can provide practical recommendations for polymer recycling, upcycling, and materials design to address plastic-waste challenge.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a reusable ATR‑FTIR immuno‑infrared biosensor with reversible protein capture that can detect single‑amino‑acid substitutions, offering broadly relevant analytical capability but little direct connection to origins‑of‑life chemistry or early life processes.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Infrared spectroscopy provides label-free access to protein structure information with high sensitivity. Challenges in infrared spectroscopy include artifacts arising from temperature changes, baseline drifts and the strong water absorption, especially in difference spectroscopy, where signals are orders of magnitude smaller than the total absorbance. Previously, we introduced an ATR-based immuno-infrared sensor (iRS) based on sophisticated surface chemistry. This provides a stable platform for covalent protein immobilization and allows its application with body fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid or blood without unspecific background. It detects misfolding of small amounts of antigen (Abeta or alpha-synuclein) by binding to an antibody or antibody fragment, which allows for the diagnosis of various neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we extend this platform by introducing reversible binding via the NColE7/Im7 pair. Im7-tagged proteins are captured with sub-picomolar affinity and quantitatively released under mild conditions (high salt or low pH), allowing repeated capture-regeneration cycles with continuous spectral monitoring of the Im7 fusion protein. Using an Im7-antibody Fab fusion protein, we present a reusable immune-IR sensor that enables multiple measurements on the same surface. For example, different antibodies can be used for differential screening. Using alternating Im7 protein attachments to the internal reflection element, we further compare Im7 single point mutants to wild-type Im7 to resolve infrared signatures of specific amino acid substitutions. Difference spectra reveal the distinct tyrosine absorption associated with either the introduction or removal of a single tyrosine residue, providing the first proof-of-concept for difference spectroscopy with single-residue sensitivity based on complete protein exchange.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Reports synthesis, structures, and visible-light bandgaps of quaternary Cu(I)–rare-earth molybdates, advancing semiconductor crystal chemistry but with little direct relevance to origins-of-life or astrobiology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cuprous-oxide semiconductors have been growing in research interest because of their promising optical and catalytic properties for solar energy conversion. While much recent research has focused on binary and ternary cuprous oxides, the more structurally complex quaternary and higher systems remain significantly less explored. Crystal growth in the cuprous rare-earth (RE) molybdate system has been investigated using high temperature and arc-melting synthesis techniques. Prior studies show the formation of two closely related compounds in these systems, occurring as either Cu6RE4(MoO4)9 (Space group: R3c, No. 161; exclusive for RE = La) or CuRE(MoO4)2 (Space group: Pbca, No. 61; for RE = Nd and heavier REs). By contrast, our new synthetic investigations for RE = Ce and La demonstrate the crystallization of both structure types, i.e., as red-colored crystals of Cu6RE4(MoO4)9 (RE = La(1) or Ce(2)) and as yellow-colored crystals of CuRE(MoO4)2 (RE = La(3) or Ce(4)), as obtained by slow cooling from 950 oC and from arc-melting techniques, respectively. Both structures similarly consist of [MoO4]2- tetrahedra bridged either by highly-distorted CuO4 tetrahedra and CeO9 tricapped trigonal prisms in 1 and 2 or by T-shaped CuO3 and CeO8 square antiprisms in 3 and 4. Optical UV-Vis diffuse reflectance measurements on powders of CuRE(MoO4)2 for RE = La, Ce, Sm, Eu, and Yb show relatively larger direct bandgaps in the range of 2.36 to 2.47 eV, while the crystals of Cu6RE4(MoO4)9 for RE = La and Ce yield smaller indirect bandgaps of about 1.89 to 2.05 eV. Electronic structure calculations show bandgaps which stem predominantly from electronic transitions between the filled 3d10-based orbitals of the Cu(I) cations and the empty d-based orbitals of the Mo(VI) cations. Thus, the RE cations are found to have an indirect effect on the optical bandgaps via changes in the local coordination environments of each of these cations. The change in crystal structure, such as from Cu6Ce4(MoO4)9 to CuCe(MoO4)2, has a dramatically larger effect of decreasing the bandgap by ~0.4 to 0.5 eV as compared to only changing the RE cation within the same structure type. In summary, new synthetic investigation of the quaternary cuprous molybdates has elucidated the impact of RE cations on their crystal structures, compositions, and visible-light bandgaps, with the underlying relationships revealed via electronic structure calculations.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Revises Eyring absolute rate theory using a residual (intermolecular-interaction) framework and links activation parameters to excess-entropy scaling to better predict viscosity and self-diffusion in liquids including water, with indirect relevance to prebiotic transport environments.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Eyring&#x27;s absolute rate theory relates fluid flow with the activation energy necessary for a molecule to go from one equilibrium position to another. Developed nearly a century ago, it remains a powerful approach for understanding transport processes in liquids. This work presents a revision of Eyring&#x27;s theory by replacing the vaporization-based parts of the theory with a residual approach that conceptualizes transport as local (re)movement of molecules within the system rather than removal from it. In this new approach, the energy barrier corresponds to the difference between a molecule with and without intermolecular interactions, effectively treating it as the residual property related to an ideal gas reference state. Furthermore, we explore the physical connections between Eyring&#x27;s absolute rate theory and Rosenfeld excess entropy scaling, revealing that both approaches describe complementary aspects of the same transport phenomena. It is tempting to link both theories. The activation parameters in Eyring&#x27;s theory, particularly the energy of activation, are shown to relate to the residual entropy used in entropy scaling. This provides a pathway to establish entropy scaling on a more rigorous physical foundation while offering deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms governing viscous flow. In comparison to experimental data, the revised theory demonstrated significant predictive power for viscosity across a wide range of thermodynamic conditions and species, including associating liquids. Moreover, parameters are transferable to other properties, such as self-diffusion.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The emergence of polar nematic phases, such as the ferroelectric (N F ) and antiferroelectric (N X ) phases, has opened new frontiers in soft matter science. However, the relationship between molecular structure, intermolecular interactions, and the resulting macroscopic order remains poorly understood. This work investigates the molecular organization in the polar nematic phases of the nJK (n=1-5) homologous series using a combined approach of polarized Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, and Atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations. A central finding is the inadequacy of single-molecule DFT models to describe the system. While DFT accurately predicts vibrational band positions, it fails to replicate their experimental intensities, suggesting that intermolecular interactions are dominant. This is further corroborated by the anomalous temperature dependence of the average absorbance for parallel and perpendicular vibrations, which deviates significantly from simple density effects. Atomistic MD simulations of a multi-molecule system provide insight into this behavior, revealing the formation of locally ordered nanodomains driven by strong short- range correlations. Experimentally, we quantified the primary nematic order parameter (S), which follows a typical progression in the N phase but shows anomalous changes at the N-N X and N X -N F transitions, ultimately saturating at a high value of S ≈ 0.7 in the ferroelectric state. The difference between orthogonal absorbance components for perpendicular vibrations reveals a significant biaxiality order parameter (C) that increases upon cooling and exceeds 1 in the N F phase. This study demonstrates that the unique properties of polar nematics are governed by specific molecular self-assembly and establishes phase biaxiality as a key feature of these systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chain dynamics govern the intricate behaviors of proteins, underpinning functions such as catalysis, recognition and stimulus response, and are an increasingly appreciated aspect of structure-function relationships. Analogously, manipulating chain dynamics and structure in abiotic polymers via sequence control is an exciting, yet underexplored, strategy for improving material functions. Here, we report a systematic study relating the sequence, structure, and dynamics of polymeric sequestrants to their binding affinity and selectivity for rare earth elements (REEs). A series of sequence-controlled polymers with metal chelating, solubilizing, and structure forming monomers was synthesized via multiblock polymerization, yielding compositionally identical polymers with spectroscopically resolved domains and distinct morphologies. Using a combination of small angle X-ray scattering and 19F NMR relaxometry measurements, we connected differences in polymer structure and dynamics to polymer sequence variables such as the patchiness (density) of the structure forming monomer and the location of the chelating monomer. Furthermore, we found that while all polymers in the series collapse more and have slower dynamics when binding REEs (lanthanum and lutetium) than calcium, these changes were sequence-dependent and localized to specific domains within the polymer. Notably, sequence-controlled polymers that exhibited the largest conformational and dynamic changes upon binding REEs also bound REEs with the greatest affinity and moderate selectivity. Collectively, these results establish a mechanistic link between monomer patterning, dynamics, morphology, and REE binding performance en route to the development of efficient and selective macromolecular chelators.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> A theoretical Marcus-type model proposes that partially solvated interfacial OH− can undergo concerted electron transfer to diverse acceptors in microdroplets, making redox reactions thermodynamically favorable and near-barrierless at the air–water interface—mechanistically relevant to prebiotic/interface chemistry but not directly focused on abiogenesis.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Microdroplet chemistry has emerged as a fascinating field. In particular, a plethora of unexpected oxidation and reduction reactions are observed at air–water interface with wide implications to chemical science and beyond. However, the explanation of microdroplet redox chemistry is challenging and controversial. Mechanistically, thermodynamic reversal over the bulk reaction, surprisingly fast kinetics (often less than milliseconds) and generality of a broad scope of substrates defy textbook understanding. Herein, we lay out a theoretical model of concerted interfacial electron transfer of OH- (partially solvated) + A^n → OH· (partially solvated) + A^{n-1}, rather than the conventional stepwise ionization-capture picture. Four different electron acceptors A^n (including a transition metal, an organic molecule, oxygen, ozone) are chosen to cover a wide range of experimental scenarios and chemical diversity. When A^n in the system is reduced upon receiving an electron, the accompanied product of OH· further serves as the oxidizing agent, capturing the intrinsic oxidative capacity of microdroplet. We then introduce a general energetic treatment to account for the partial solvation of OH- at heterogeneous water interface and develop a Marcus-theory-based reaction rate formalism that integrates the energetic distribution. We quantitatively analyze both the thermodynamic and the kinetic consequences of this model. For all four cases analyzed, the otherwise unfavorable thermodynamic penalty (ΔG° &gt; 0) for the bulk reaction is reversed at water interface (ΔG° &lt; 0) after a certain dehydration level. Remarkably, for all these cases, interfacial electron transfer becomes near-barrierless (ΔG° ≈ -λ, ΔG‡ ≤ 3 kcal/mol) for a substantial sub-population of partially solvated OH-. Thus, the water interface can prepare and gate a substantial donor population whose electrons are nearly ready to tunnel into a broad range of acceptors across the interface, which explains the surprisingly fast reaction rate observed in experiments. This model further predicts absolute rate constants that are in agreement with kinetic measurement on microdroplets. Finally, a phase diagram is constructed to depict the vast thermodynamic and kinetic (barrierless reaction) zones that are newly opened by the water interface, thus accounting for reaction generality.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study shows how ligand choice and copper nuclearity in discrete Mo–Cu sulfide clusters tune sulfur-centered hydrogen evolution thermochemistry and stability, offering a mineral-inspired catalyst framework potentially relevant to early Earth redox/energy chemistry but not directly addressing abiogenesis.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Heterobimetallic clusters comprising Group 6 thiometallates and earth-abundant transition metals are of significant interest for applications in laser technology, telecommunications, sensing, and catalysis. An advantage of clusters relative to the bulk-state materials is their tunable architecture, which enables precise modulation of physicochemical properties and reactivity through ligand and core structure manipulation. Recently, we reported the Mo–Cu cluster [Tp*MoS3(CuSPh)2]– ([1•(CuSPh)2]–; Tp* = tris(3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl)borate) as a discrete model of layered Cu2MoS4 and functional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) via a sulfur-centered pathway. While the Tp* ligand was found to be essential for stabilizing the clusters and precluding the formation of reactive Mo-hydrides, the impact of copper ligation and nuclearity remained uncertain. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterization of a series of derivatives, [1•(CuX)n]– and [1•(CuL)n]1–n, systematically varying the ancillary X- and L-type copper ligands. Single crystal XRD and 1H DOSY NMR analyses reveal that while nuclearities of n = 2-4 are accessible in the solid state, the higher-order clusters (n = 3, 4) exhibit significant solution-state lability. Electrocatalytic evaluations show that the new clusters are markedly less active for the HER than the thiophenolate parent. DFT calculations attribute this difference to the attenuated sulfur basicity and (in some cases) weaker S–H bonds that result from increased copper nuclearity, ancillary ligand donicity, or overall charge. Collectively, this work reveals that while copper ligation and nuclearity offer a modular approach to tuning HER thermochemistry, these changes also impact the cluster’s ability to maintain structural integrity under catalytic conditions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Presents ACCEL, an ML-guided self-driving lab that co-optimizes photoluminescence and XRD feedback to autonomously identify and stabilize phase-pure quasi-2D formamidinium halide perovskites.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) are poised to transform materials discovery by integrating automation with machine learning (ML) to accelerate data-driven experimentation. However, most SDL frameworks remain limited by single-feedback optimization and lack the multi-modal diagnostics needed to resolve both optical and structural evolution in complex hybrid systems. Here, we introduce ACCEL, an automated, ML-guided closed-loop platform for identifying and synthesizing target pure phases within quasi-2D halide perovskite systems. Using a ternary 3D:2D compositional space comprising 3D FAPbI3 and two Dion–Jacobson (DJ) spacer–based components, ACCEL optimizes the 3D:2D ratios to identify compositions that converge toward a structurally and optically stable α-FAPbI3-like phase within a quasi-2D design space. Automated in-situ photoluminescence (PL) is used to monitor crystallization kinetics in real time, revealing how the relative fraction of co-spacers governs nucleation rate and phase evolution during film formation. These kinetic insights are integrated with high-throughput synthesis, automated PL analysis, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) similarity metrics within a Gaussian Process–Bayesian Optimization framework to suppress phase heterogeneity and stabilize the target phase. Rather than targeting a predefined DJ layer number, ACCEL enables optimization based on user-defined optical and structural signatures, providing a generalizable route for autonomous phase discovery in complex hybrid materials.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Quantifying and differentiating the structural characteristics of clathrate hydrates at the molecular level is crucial for understanding the properties that underpin hydrate-based technologies. While useful, current approaches lack sufficient resolution to discern, e.g., interfacial and dynamical structures. In this study, we present an algorithm based on Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) that accurately identifies different water states coexisting within clathrate hydrates. A key novel component is an effective cavity-finder algorithm, which provides input to the clustering framework. The new algorithm detects hydrate cavities by analyzing the number and type of constituent molecular rings around voids. Integrating the new algorithm with widely used order parameters (e.g., F3, F4, and F4t) provides a powerful and accurate tool for analyzing hydrate structures at interfaces and phase transitions. The performance of the new algorithm is assessed for structure I (sI) CO2 hydrates and for structure II (sII) mixed CH4/Dioxane hydrates, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability across different clathrates. Crucially, the proposed algorithm enables us to identify partially ordered structures characteristic of the quasi-liquid layer, thereby capturing interfacial dynamics and molecular-scale details essential for understanding hydrates under realistic conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05514v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: As remarked by Boltzmann, the Second Law of Thermodynamics is notable for the fact that it is readily proved using elementary statistical arguments, but becomes harder and harder to verify the more precise the microscopic description of a system. In this article, we investigate one particular realization of the 2nd Law, namely Joule heating in a wire under electrical bias. We analyze the production of entropy in an exactly solvable model of a quantum wire wherein the conserved flow of entropy under unitary quantum evolution is taken into account using an exact formula for the entropy current of a system of independent quantum particles. In this exact microscopic description of the quantum dynamics, the entropy production due to Joule heating does not arise automatically. Instead, we show that the expected entropy production is realized in the limit of a large number of local measurements by a series of floating thermoelectric probes along the length of the wire, which inject entropy into the system as a result of the information obtained via their continuous measurements of the system. The decoherence resulting from inelastic processes introduced by the local measurements is essential to the phenomenon of entropy production due to Joule heating, and would be expected to arise due to inelastic scattering in real systems of interacting particles.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05925v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The distribution of entanglement between the nodes of a quantum network plays a fundamental role in quantum information applications. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of a network of qubits where each edge corresponds to an independent two-qubit interaction. By applying tools from percolation theory, we study how entanglement dynamically spreads across the network. We show that the interplay between unitary evolution and spatially correlated disorder leads to a non-standard percolation phenomenology, significantly richer than uniform bond percolation and featuring hysteresis. A two-colour correlated bond percolation model, whose phase diagram is determined via numerical simulations and a mean-field theory, fully elucidates the physics behind this phenomenon.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05277v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: This article proposes a research and development direction that would lead to the creation of next-generation intelligent technical systems. A distinctive feature of these systems is their ability to undergo evolutionary change. Cognitive architectures are now one of the most promising ways to create Artificial General Intelligence systems. One of the main problems of modern cognitive architectures is an excessively schematic approach to modeling the processes of cognitive activity. It does not allow the creation of a universal architecture that would be capable of reproducing higher nervous functions without using a predetermined set of perception patterns. Our paper proposes an evolutionary approach to creating a cognitive architecture. The basis of this approach is the use of a functional core, which consistently generates the intellectual functions of an autonomous agent. We are considering a cognitive architecture that includes components, the interaction of which ensures the evolution of the agent. The discussion of the development of intelligence is carried out using the conceptual apparatus of semiotics. This allows us to consider the task of developing cognitive functions as a problem of establishing a connection between the Merkwelt and the Werkwelt through the creation of the Innenwelt. The problem of early postnatal ontogenesis is investigated on the basis of the theory of constructivism: we discuss the requirements for the functional core and its composition, as well as the mechanism that initiates the process of cognition.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05994v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Resilience is a property of social, ecological, social-ecological and biophysical systems. It describes the capacity of a system to cope with, adapt to and innovate in response to a changing surrounding. Given the current climate change crisis, ensuring conditions for a sustainable future for the habitability on the planet is fundamentally dependent on Earth System (ES) resilience. It is thus particularly relevant to establish a model that captures and frames resilience of the ES, most particularly in physical terms that can be influenced by human policy\footnote{See page 4 for examples of strategies}. In this work we propose that resilience can serve as a theoretical foundation when unpacking and describing metastable states of equilibrium and energy dissipation in any dynamic description of the variables that characterise the ES. Since the impact of the human activities can be suitably gauged by the planetary boundaries (PBs) and the planet&#x27;s temperature is the net result of the multiple PB variables, such as $\text{CO}_2$ concentration and radiative forcing, atmospheric aerosol loading, atmospheric ozone depletion, etc, then resilience features arise once conditions to avoid an ES runaway to a state where the average temperature is much higher than the current one. Our model shows that this runaway can be prevented by the presence of metastable states and dynamic friction built out of the interaction among the PB variables once suitable conditions are satisfied. In this work these conditions are specified. As humanity moves away from Holocene conditions, we argue that resilience features arising from metastable states might be crucial for the ES to follow sustainable trajectories in the Anthropocene that prevent it run into a much hotter potential equilibrium state.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05387v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: One of the key goals of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is to directly image about 25 potentially habitable exoplanets and determine their properties. This challenge will require a large survey of nearby, bright stars -- ~100 according to the Astro2020 Decadel Survey. To ensure the success of the mission and to help guide design decisions, the stellar multiplicity of the target stars must be well-understood. To this end, we present optical speckle imaging of stars in the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) provisional HWO star list, which is currently the Tier 1 target list for the HWO Target Stars and Systems Sub-Working Group. We obtained new observations using `Alopeke and Zorro at Gemini Observatory and queried the Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program Archive for archival observations, resulting in speckle imaging data for 80 of the 164 stars. We confirmed one candidate companion detected previously by Gaia (HD 90089) and obtained an ambiguous detection of a known companion (HD 212330). To examine our sensitivity to companions, we simulated stellar companions down to ~0.1 $M_{\odot}$ for each target and found that 75%-85% would be detected in our speckle images; the remaining simulated companions are either too faint or too close-in, and will require follow-up using other methods such as long-term spectroscopic measurements and space-based techniques. This work represents a first step towards surveying potential HWO targets for close-in stellar companions and helping to inform the target selection process for the HWO direct-imaging survey, bringing us closer towards the discovery of potential habitable worlds.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05480v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The abundances of atmospheric carbon species--carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4)--exert fundamental controls on the climate, redox state, and prebiotic environment of terrestrial planets. As exoplanet atmospheric characterization advances, it is essential to understand how these species are regulated on habitable terrestrial planets across a wide range of stellar and planetary conditions. Here, we develop an integrated numerical model that couples atmospheric chemistry, climate, and the long-term carbon cycle to investigate the atmospheric compositions of lifeless, Earth-like planets orbiting Sun-like (F-, G-, and K-type) stars. Our simulations demonstrate that CO2, CO, and CH4 generally increase with orbital distance, and that planets near the outer edge of the habitable zone may undergo CO runaway--a photochemical instability driven by severe depletion of OH radicals. The threshold for CO runaway depends strongly on stellar spectral type and is most easily triggered around cooler, lower-mass stars. In contrast, the atmospheric production of formaldehyde (H2CO)--a key precursor for prebiotic organic chemistry--peaks around planets orbiting more massive, UV-luminous stars and is maximized at orbital distances just interior to the CO-runaway threshold. These results establish a quantitative framework linking observable system properties--stellar type and orbital distance--and the atmospheric carbon chemistry of lifeless Earth-like planets, providing new context for interpreting future spectroscopic observations and for evaluating the potential of such planets to sustain prebiotic chemistry.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Shows that standard pressure-broadening assumptions overpredict FeH and distort near-IR continua in TRAPPIST-1–like M dwarfs, implying improved stellar spectral models are needed for reliable characterization of TRAPPIST-1 planets’ atmospheres and potential biosignature inferences.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05313v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Available one-dimensional stellar models fail to reproduce the observed spectrum of the ultracool M dwarf TRAPPIST-1. In particular, current models predict strong iron hydride (FeH) absorption due to the Wing-Ford bands at 0.99$\mu$m, yet this spectral feature is only weakly present in TRAPPIST-1 and other mid-to-late M dwarf stars. Additionally, the shape of the continuum between the water bands in the near-infrared does not match between models and observations. Here, we show that assumptions about pressure broadening, specifically van der Waals broadening, have a dramatic effect on modeled broadband spectral features. We use Merged Parallelized Simplified-ATLAS to generate synthetic spectra over a range of van der Waals broadening strengths, adopting 1D PHOENIX temperature-pressure structures. We find that minimal broadening best matches the observed FeH profile at 0.99$\mu$m and in the pseudocontinuum between the large water bands. These results suggest that broadening prescriptions derived for Sun-like stars are not valid for lower-mass stars and that pressure broadening for molecular lines in cool stellar atmospheres must be reevaluated. Refining pressure broadening treatments will improve the accuracy of M dwarf spectral models, enabling more reliable determinations of stellar properties and atmospheric compositions of planets orbiting M dwarfs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.10060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant shift in astrochemistry with a renewed focus on the role of non-thermal processes on the molecular interstellar medium, in particular energetic particles (such as cosmic ray particles and fast electrons) and X-ray radiation. This has been brought about in large part due to new observations of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMS) in environments that would inhibit their formation, such as cold, dense gas in prestellar cores or in the highly energetic environments in galactic centers. In parallel, there has been a plethora of new laboratory investigations on the role of high-energy radiation and electrons on the chemistry of astrophysical ices, demonstrating the ability of this radiation to induce complex chemistry. In recent years, theoretical models have also begun to include newer cosmic-ray-driven processes in both the gas and ice phases. In this review, we unify aspects of the chemistry driven by X-ray radiation and energetic particles into a ``high-energy astrochemistry&#x27;&#x27;, defining this term and reviewing the underlying chemical processes. We conclude by examining various laboratories where high-energy astrochemistry is at play and identify future issues to be tackled.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05389v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We examine the differences between the driven turbulence described by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation and the second law of thermodynamics. A general velocity and entropy density system is analyzed with the unified thermodynamic algorithm of metriplectic dynamics, and we show that the positive spectra of the KS equation due to an external energy source prevent its metriplectic description. A variant of the KS equation is produced that monotonically generates an entropy, but the only equilibria of this variant system are spatially constant. Numerical experiments are performed comparing the evolution of the KS equation and its thermodynamic variant. The entropy of this thermodynamic system is increased further by the driving effects of the KS equation, reconciling the generation of entropy with the energy source of the KS equation. Further numerical experiments restrict the positive spectra in the KS equation to determine the effect on the system time evolution. While rescaling the growth rates of instabilities reproduces similar behavior on a slower time scale, introduction of individual positive spectra reproduces the formation of equilibria, relative equilibria, and a transition to chaos.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05932v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Binaries occur in many astrophysical systems, from young protostellar binaries in star forming regions to supermassive black hole binaries in galaxy centers. In many cases, a circumbinary disk of gas forms around the binary with an orbit that may be misaligned to the binary plane. Misaligned disks around nearly circular binaries evolve into disks that are either aligned or counteraligned with the binary orbit. However, if the binary is sufficiently eccentric, then it can be more likely that the disk ends up in a polar-aligned configuration in which the disk angular momentum vector aligns with the binary eccentricity vector. We use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations, evolved to an approximate steady state under mass injection, to determine the orbital evolution of a binary with a polar-aligned disk for a range of binary-disk parameters. We find that, in all of the cases we have simulated, the binary shrinks with time. The decay rate is larger than for binaries surrounded by aligned or retrograde disks with matched disk parameters. The rate of shrinkage is largely unaltered by the size of the sink radii employed for the binary stars, but for small enough sink radii some of the models exhibit long-lived polar circumprimary disks, which are continually fed mass from the circumbinary disk. We discuss our results in the contexts of planet formation in young polar-aligned disks and merging supermassive black holes in galaxy centers.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05423v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Standard fractional calculus has successfully modeled systems with power-law memory. However, complex phenomena in heterogeneous media often exhibit multi-scale memory effects and aging properties that classical operators cannot capture. In this work, we construct a unified framework by defining the \textit{Weighted Weyl-Sonine Operators}. This formalism offers a fundamental generalization of fractional calculus, freeing the theory from the constraints of power-law memory (via Sonine kernels), time-translation invariance (via scale and weight functions), and artificial history truncation (via Weyl integration). The main result is a Generalized Spectral Mapping Theorem, proving that the Weighted Fourier Transform acts as a universal diagonalization map for these operators. We rigorously characterize the admissible memory kernels through the class of \textit{Complete Bernstein Functions}, ensuring that the resulting operators preserve the fundamental properties of positivity and monotonicity. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical bridge between the algebraic Sonine definition and the analytical Marchaud representation involving L\&#x27;evy measures. Finally, we apply this theory to solve generalized relaxation equations and \textit{Weighted Distributed Order} evolution problems, demonstrating that phenomena of ultra-slow diffusion and retarded aging can be treated explicitly within this unified spectral framework.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> G-rich repetitive nucleic acid sequences can fold into G-quadruplexes (G4s) upon coordination with potassium ions (K+). Small natural and synthetic molecules (G4 ligands) can bind to and stabilize G4 structures in vitro, thereby interfering with biological processes involving G4-containing genes. Therefore, G4 ligands represent highly valuable tools for unveiling G4 biological functions. Together with non-covalent reversible G4 ligands, reactive compounds capable of forming covalent bonds with G4s upon thermal and photochemical activation represent a new class of promising G4 ligands with the potential to be harnessed for the identification and isolation of G4s from a biological environment. In particular, photoaffinity labelling (PAL) encompasses the potential to obtain spatial and temporal control over the alkylation event. However, to date, only a few examples of covalent G4 ligands for PAL approaches have been described, and very low alkylation yields plague all of them. Herein, the synthesis of new families of photoactivatable G4 ligands functionalized with different warheads (e.g., benzophenones and diazirines) is described, as well as their photoreactivity in the presence of three different G4s: 22AG, cMyc, and 25CEBwt. Among the different compounds, diazirine derivatives displayed the highest G4 selectivity and unprecedented high alkylation yields (up to 70%) together with a remarkable selective N- and O-alkylation reaction only on thymine and guanine nucleobases as identified by using a prototype ligand. These new compounds pave the way for the development of new methodologies, allowing for functional investigation and druggability of G4 in cells.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05976v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We present a rotational velocity (vsini) survey of 32 stellar/substellar objects and giant planets using Keck/KPIC high-resolution spectroscopy, including 6 giant planets (2-7 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) and 25 substellar/stellar companions (12-88 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$). Adding companions with spin measurements from the literature, we construct a curated spin sample for 43 benchmark stellar/substellar companions and giant planets and 54 free-floating brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects. We compare their spins, parameterized as fractional breakup velocities at 10 Myr, assuming constant angular momentum evolution. We find the first clear evidence that giant planets exhibit distinct spins versus low-mass brown dwarf companions (10 to 40 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) at 4-4.5 $\sigma$ significance assuming inclinations aligned with their orbits, while under randomly oriented inclinations the significance is at 1.6-2.1 $\sigma$. Our findings hold when considering various assumptions about planets, and the mass ratio below 0.8% gives a clean cut for rotation between giant planets and brown dwarf companions. The higher fractional breakup velocities of planets can be interpreted as less angular momentum loss through circumplanetary disk braking during the planet formation phase. Brown dwarf companions exhibit evidence of slower rotation compared to isolated brown dwarfs, while planets and planetary mass objects show similar spins. Finally, our analysis of specific angular momentum versus age of 221 stellar/substellar objects below 0.1 MSun with spin measurements in the literature indicates that the substellar objects of 5-40 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ retain much higher angular momenta compared to stellar and substellar objects of 40-100 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ after 10 Myr, when their initial angular momenta were set.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2407.13154v4 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Planetary systems with multiple transiting planets are beneficial for understanding planet occurrence rates and system architectures. Although we have yet to find a solar system analogue, future surveys may detect multiple terrestrial planets transiting a Sun-like star. In this work, we simulate transit timing observations of our system based on the actual orbital motions of Venus and the Earth+Moon (EM) -- influenced by the other solar system objects -- and retrieve the system&#x27;s dynamical parameters for varying noise levels and observing durations. Using an approximate coplanar N-body model for transit-time variations, we consider test configurations with 2, 3, and 4 planets. For various observing baselines, we can robustly retrieve the masses and orbits of Venus and EM; detect Jupiter at high significance (for &lt; 90-second timing error and baseline $\leq$ 15 yrs); and detect Mars at 5 $\sigma$ confidence (with &lt; 20-second timing error and baseline $\geq$ 27 yrs) using TTVFaster. We also find that the 3-planet model is generally preferred, and provide equations to estimate the mass precision of Venus/Earth/Jupiter-analogues. The addition of Mars -- which is near a 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Earth -- improves our retrieval of Jupiter&#x27;s parameters, suggesting that unseen terrestrials could interfere in the characterization of multi-planetary systems. Our findings are comparable to theoretical limits based upon stellar variability and may eventually be possible.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05758v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Ice nucleation is greatly important in areas as diverse as climate change, cryobiology, geology or food industry. Predicting the ability of a substrate to induce the nucleation of ice from supercooled water is a difficult problem. Here, we use molecular simulations to analyse how the ice nucleating ability is affected by the substrate lattice structure and orientation. We focus on different model lattices: simple cubic, body centred cubic and face centred cubic, and assess their ability to induce ice nucleation by calculating nucleation rates. Several orientations are studied for the case of the face centred cubic lattice. Curiously, a hexagonal symmetry does not guarantee a better ice nucleating ability. By comparing the body centred cubic and the cubic lattices we determined that there is a significant role of the underlying crystal plane(s) on ice nucleation. The structure of the liquid layer adjacent to the substrate reveals that more efficient nucleants induce a more structured liquid. The most efficient substrates present a strong sensitivity of their ice nucleating ability to the lattice parameters. Introducing a novel methodological approach, we use Classical Nucleation Theory to estimate the contact angle of the ice nucleus on the studied substrates from the calculated nucleation rates. The method also provides the nucleation free energy barrier height, the kinetic pre-factor and the critical cluster size. The latter is in agreement with the nucleus size obtained through a microscopic analysis of the nucleation trajectories, which supports the validity of Classical Nucleation Theory down to small critical clusters.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2507.11300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) chalcogenides are stable, non-toxic candidates for optoelectronic or thermoelectric applications. The structural diversity of RP oxides is already exploited to tune properties or achieve more advanced functionalities like multiferroicity, however, little is known about the structural evolution of RP chalcogenides. In this work, we develop a high-accuracy machine-learned interatomic potential to run large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on $Ba_{n+1}Zr_nS_{3n+1}$ for $n=1$ to $n=6$. We predict new polymorphs for each $n$-value, calculate their corresponding phase transition temperatures, and validate our approach through comparison to published experimental results. We find that the $n=1$ phase exhibits negative thermal expansion, that $n=1$ and $n=3$ undergo unusual ascending symmetry breaking, and that phases with $n\geq4$ form layer-dependent tilt patterns previously unreported for inorganic RP materials. This unique behaviour results from competition between octahedral rotations and rumpling at the rocksalt interface, and suggests new strategies for accessing advanced functionalities.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2508.08012v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Complex physical simulations often require trade-offs between model fidelity and computational feasibility. We introduce Adaptive Online Emulation (AOE), which dynamically learns neural network surrogates during simulation execution to accelerate expensive components. Unlike existing methods requiring extensive offline training, AOE uses Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machines (OS-ELMs) to continuously adapt emulators along the actual simulation trajectory. We employ a numerically stable variant of the OS-ELM using cumulative sufficient statistics to avoid matrix inversion instabilities. AOE integrates with time-stepping frameworks through a three-phase strategy balancing data collection, updates, and surrogate usage, while requiring orders of magnitude less training data than conventional surrogate approaches. Demonstrated on a 1D atmospheric model of exoplanet GJ1214b, AOE achieves 11.1 times speedup (91% time reduction) across 200,000 timesteps while maintaining accuracy, potentially making previously intractable high-fidelity time-stepping simulations computationally feasible.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05792v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Accurate drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is essential for computational drug discovery, yet existing models often rely on single-modality predefined molecular descriptors or sequence-based embeddings with limited representativeness. We propose Tensor-DTI, a contrastive learning framework that integrates multimodal embeddings from molecular graphs, protein language models, and binding-site predictions to improve interaction modeling. Tensor-DTI employs a siamese dual-encoder architecture, enabling it to capture both chemical and structural interaction features while distinguishing interacting from non-interacting pairs. Evaluations on multiple DTI benchmarks demonstrate that Tensor-DTI outperforms existing sequence-based and graph-based models. We also conduct large-scale inference experiments on CDK2 across billion-scale chemical libraries, where Tensor-DTI produces chemically plausible hit distributions even when CDK2 is withheld from training. In enrichment studies against Glide docking and Boltz-2 co-folder, Tensor-DTI remains competitive on CDK2 and improves the screening budget required to recover moderate fractions of high-affinity ligands on out-of-family targets under strict family-holdout splits. Additionally, we explore its applicability to protein-RNA and peptide-protein interactions. Our findings highlight the benefits of integrating multimodal information with contrastive objectives to enhance interaction-prediction accuracy and to provide more interpretable and reliability-aware models for virtual screening.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05891v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The splitting of the principal peak in the structure factor of liquid water is commonly interpreted as evidence of a competition between two distinct local environments. Here, we show that this peak splitting arises from medium-range topological features of the hydrogen-bond network. Using atomistic simulations, we systematically decompose the structure factor into contributions from hydrogen-bonded rings of different sizes. We find that 5-8-membered rings, which dominate the network topology of liquid water at low temperatures, can directly explain the experimentally observed bimodal scattering signal. Among these, 5-membered rings are particularly persistent, maintaining distinct structural signatures even above room temperature. Our findings establish a direct link between the network topology of liquid water and experimentally accessible diffraction features, clarifying the microscopic basis of water&#x27;s behaviour and suggesting a broader conceptual framework for interpreting the anomalies in tetrahedral network liquids and glasses.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> G-rich repetitive nucleic acid sequences can fold into G-quadruplexes (G4s) upon coordination with potassium ions (K+). Small natural and synthetic molecules (G4 ligands) can bind to and stabilize G4 structures in vitro, thereby interfering with biological processes involving G4-containing genes. Therefore, G4 ligands represent highly valuable tools for unveiling G4 biological functions. Together with non-covalent reversible G4 ligands, reactive compounds capable of forming covalent bonds with G4s upon thermal and photochemical activation represent a new class of promising G4 ligands with the potential to be harnessed for the identification and isolation of G4s from a biological environment. In particular, photoaffinity labelling (PAL) encompasses the potential to obtain spatial and temporal control over the alkylation event. However, to date, only a few examples of covalent G4 ligands for PAL approaches have been described, and very low alkylation yields plague all of them. Herein, the synthesis of new families of photoactivatable G4 ligands functionalized with different warheads (e.g., benzophenones and diazirines) is described, as well as their photoreactivity in the presence of three different G4s: 22AG, cMyc, and 25CEBwt. Among the different compounds, diazirine derivatives displayed the highest G4 selectivity and unprecedented high alkylation yields (up to 70%) together with a remarkable selective N- and O-alkylation reaction only on thymine and guanine nucleobases as identified by using a prototype ligand. These new compounds pave the way for the development of new methodologies, allowing for functional investigation and druggability of G4 in cells.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Immune cells play essential roles in maintaining tissue homeostasis and responding to abnormal growth, but how innate immune cells adapt to chronic apoptotic signaling remains poorly understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, hemocytes, particularly plasmatocytes, are recruited to tumor-like overgrowths, yet their transcriptional diversity and lineage dynamics under these conditions remain undefined. Here, we apply single-cell RNA sequencing to nearly 50,000 circulating and sessile hemocytes from larvae bearing undead overgrown eye discs, a model of regenerative overgrowth driven by sustained caspase activity. We resolve 17 transcriptionally distinct hemocyte clusters, including known lineages and 13 previously unrecognized plasmatocyte subtypes. Interestingly, specific plasmatocyte populations are differentially expanded or depleted under overgrowth conditions. Notably, we identify a matrix-remodeling plasmatocyte population marked by high expression of Jonah-family serine proteases. Pseudotime analysis reveals unexpected plasmatocyte plasticity and two novel terminally differentiated effector states. These findings define the immune landscape of tumor-like overgrowth and establish Drosophila as a platform for dissecting innate immune responses to tissue stress and dysregulated growth in vivo.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In eukaryotes, transcription elongation factors (TEFs) associate with RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) to facilitate gene expression and couple transcription to co-transcriptional processes, including chromatin regulation and RNA processing. To further our understanding of TEF biology, we developed a domain-centric analysis pipeline to perform a broad survey of ten TEF orthologs -- Paf1, Ctr9, Cdc73, Rtf1, Leo1, Spt4, Spt5, Spt6, Spn1, and Elf1 -- across the Tree of Life and analyze their evolutionary patterns in a structural context. We report evidence for all ten TEFs being present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor, indicating that mechanisms of TEF-mediated transcription regulation are both ancient and conserved. However, some early-diverging eukaryotic clades exhibit signs of altered TEF domain composition. A comparative phylogenetic analysis highlighted conserved regions of TEFs that are detected in both metazoans and fungi and other regions that appear clade-specific, detected only in metazoans. These observations, together with additional insights generated from evolutionary rate covariation analysis, shed light on under-characterized aspects of TEFs, including domains for which functions have yet to be dissected.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study dissects how K606 acetylation in the PABPC1 PABC domain selectively strengthens binding to the eukaryotic translation termination factor eRF3a, reshaping PAM2-mediated partner competition and mRNA fate—highly relevant to modern eukaryotic regulation but only tangential to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In eukaryotic cells, almost all mRNA transcripts are polyadenylated in the nucleus, with the poly(A)-tail being critical for their export, translation and stability. PABPC1 is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein (RBP) that binds poly(A)-tails and is a key driver of mRNA post-transcriptional regulation. It achieves this in part by interacting with a broad range of PAM2-motif containing proteins that bind the same common site within PABPC1&#x27;s PABC domain but result in diverse regulatory outcomes. Regulation of this intricate network of interactions remains poorly understood but our previous studies revealed the regulatory potential of mutually-exclusive acetylation or dimethylation of a key lysine sidechain (K606). To address this, we undertook a systematic study of PAM2-motifs, identifying translation termination factor eRF3a and translation repressor PAIP2 as having a &gt;ten-fold higher affinity for PABPC1 relative to eleven other PAM2-motif partner proteins. Acetylation of PABPC1 at K606 specifically enhances its affinity for eRF3a in vitro, and we present the crystal structure of the specifically K606 acetylated C-terminal domain of PABPC1 in complex with the PAM2 motif of eRF3a, providing structural and functional insights into how acetylation facilitates competitive eRF3a recruitment to PABPC1 and mRNA. We further demonstrate that K606 acetylation promotes PABPC1-eRF3a interaction in cells, thereby antagonising other PAM2-dependent RNA effectors. Taken together, our results show that acetylation of lysine 606 in the PABC domain can specifically modulate PABPC1 partner selectivity, providing crucial insight into how PABPC1 multifunctionality can be regulated to coordinate mRNA usage and fate in the cytoplasm.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This preprint dissects how chronic stress alters eukaryotic RNA stress granule/P-body dynamics via myosin and nucleator proteins, a modern cell-biology finding with only indirect relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic RNA granules that rapidly form in response to various stresses concurrent with mRNA translation shutdown, contributing to cellular adaptation and disease pathogenesis. While SG assembly and disassembly under acute stress have been extensively characterized, how SGs behave under chronic stress remains poorly understood. We previously reported that chronic stress preconditioning inhibits the earliest steps of SG assembly via translation-dependent mechanisms. In contrast, the regulation of SG maturation under chronic stress has not yet been investigated. Here, we show that chronic stress decreases SG size by disrupting the MYH9-dependent myosin crosstalk with core SG nucleator G3BP1. This defect leads to impaired SG and processing body (PB) docking as well, limiting the biogenesis of early SGs. Furthermore, chronic stress reduces expression of the SG nucleator UBAP2L, required for SG-PB docking, thus exacerbating these deficiences. In summary, chronic stress disrupts the myosin-SG-PB network and inhibits SG maturation in a translation-independent manner.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Compares direct prebiotic chemical synthesis versus prolonged chemical evolution models for the emergence of RNA (and other biopolymers), outlining distinct predictions and experimental implications for abiogenesis on early Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Direct chemical synthesis and chemical evolution are conceptually different models for the prebiotic origin of RNA and other biopolymers. These models generate distinct predictions and motivate different experimental approaches. Here, we compare these two models. In the direct chemical synthesis model, the inherent chemical reactivities of prebiotic compounds on the ancient Earth led to RNA, which subsequently initiated Darwinian evolution. The direct synthesis model depends upon the prebiotic availability of sugars, nucleic acid bases, amino acids, and other chemical species. In this model stepwise chemical reactions directed by inherent reactivities of small molecule feedstocks combine in serial and parallel reactions to produce RNA. The basis of selection is generally limited to inherent chemical reactivities in systems with low chemical heterogeneity. In a fundamentally different and more recent model, it is assumed that RNA emerged along with other biopolymers during a prolonged period of chemical evolution occurring in complex ensembles of organic compounds under dynamic, continually shifting selective pressures. The evolutionary model presages a deep biological entanglement between various types of biomolecules. If chemical evolution produced molecules such as RNA and protein and glycan, then humankind will gain advantage by understanding and redirecting these processes. It is not currently known whether direct chemical synthesis or chemical evolution or some combination of these processes provides a viable prebiotic path to RNA.</p>

The creature seems to defy well-understood rules of biology by combining physical traits in a bizarre way. They&#x27;re egg-laying mammals with duck bills and beaver-like tails, and the males have venomous spurs on their hind feet. In that regard, it&#x27;s only fitting that astronomers describe some newly discovered oddball objects as &quot;Astronomy&#x27;s Platypus.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Structural and mechanistic study of the human tRNA m5C methyltransferase NSUN2 showing structure-driven, sequence-tolerant tRNA remodeling for cytosine methylation, with a reported small-molecule inhibitor, but only tangential relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The human RNA m5C methyltransferase NSUN2 catalyzes site-specific cytosine methylation across diverse RNA substrates and thereby regulates a wide range of biological and physiological processes. However, the molecular basis by which NSUN2 achieves broad substrate recognition while maintaining catalytic specificity has remained unclear. Here we determine structures of human NSUN2 in both substrate-free and substrate-bound states using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. Structures of NSUN2 in complex with multiple tRNA substrates reveal a structure-first, sequence-tolerant strategy in which NSUN2 actively remodels tRNA architecture, exposing the buried target cytosine and positioning it within the catalytic pocket for methyl transfer. This recognition strategy enables NSUN2 to accommodate diverse tRNA substrates through a largely conserved interaction interface. Guided by these structural insights, we identify a small-molecule inhibitor that suppresses NSUN2 activity and cancer cell proliferation. Together, our findings define the molecular principles underlying NSUN2-mediated RNA m5C modification and provide a structural foundation for targeting NSUN2 in cancers.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Inferring the fitness effect of mutations is a basic problem in understanding the evolution of populations over time. When multiple mutations are present in a population simultaneously, genetic linkage comes into play, and the fate of an individual mutation depends on both its fitness as well as the background on which it occurs. Accurate inference of fitness effects for evolutionary systems with multiple competing mutations is therefore contingent on resolving the confounding effects of genetic linkage, captured by the covariance between allele-pairs. Increasingly, evolutionary studies are using short-read sequencing technologies to produce detailed snapshots of evolving populations. This presents a problem as the frequencies of allele-pairs are not known beyond the read-length, hampering any attempt to resolve the effects of genetic linkage between pairs of loci residing on different reads. Here we present a computationally efficient pipeline for inferring selection from short-read time-series data with partial allele-pair frequency information, while accounting for linkage. Simulation results show that the method has good performance and is scalable to systems with several thousand variants. Additionally, we demonstrate the pipelines utility on real datasets of within-host HIV and SARS-CoV-2 evolution, showcasing its applicability in resolving linkage effects from complex evolutionary histories.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces OKR-CELL, a large-scale cross-modal single-cell RNA-seq foundation model that uses LLM/RAG-enriched cell descriptions and a robust alignment objective to improve performance across multi-omics and cell-text retrieval tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent advancements in single-cell multi-omics, particularly RNA-seq, have provided profound insights into cellular heterogeneity and gene regulation. While pre-trained language model (PLM) paradigm based single-cell foundation models have shown promise, they remain constrained by insufficient integration of in-depth individual profiles and neglecting the influence of noise within multi-modal data. To address both issues, we propose an Open-world Language Knowledge-Aided Robust Single-Cell Foundation Model (OKR-CELL). It is built based on a cross-modal Cell-Language pre-training framework, which comprises two key innovations: (1) leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) based workflow with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches cell textual descriptions using open-world knowledge; (2) devising a Cross-modal Robust Alignment (CRA) objective that incorporates sample reliability assessment, curriculum learning, and coupled momentum contrastive learning to strengthen the model&#x27;s resistance to noisy data. After pretraining on 32M cell-text pairs, OKR-CELL obtains cutting-edge results across 6 evaluation tasks. Beyond standard benchmarks such as cell clustering, cell-type annotation, batch-effect correction, and few-shot annotation, the model also demonstrates superior performance in broader multi-modal applications, including zero-shot cell-type annotation and bidirectional cell-text retrieval.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Methodological study on how single-cell RNA-seq reference choice affects deconvolution accuracy in breast cancer spatial transcriptomics, with no direct relevance to origins-of-life questions beyond incidental RNA mention.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Background Spot-based Spatial transcriptomics (ST) allows for unbiased gene expression analysis within tissue architecture, overcoming the limitations of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) by preserving spatial context. However, the high spatial resolution in ST leads to cellular heterogeneity within spots, requiring computational deconvolution to infer cellular compositions. While scRNA-seq serves as a key reference for deconvolution, the impact of reference composition on its accuracy is still unclear. In this study, we systematically evaluate the impact of reference selection for cellular deconvolution and give helpful guide-lines to researchers to address this task. Methods We systematically evaluate the impact of single-cell reference selection for global and cell type-specific deconvolution performances in primary and metastatic breast cancer ST datasets. Focusing on state-of-the-art deconvolution tools Cell2location and Robust Cell Type Decomposition (RCTD), we assess the influence of varying reference sizes, cell-type distributions, reference-ST pairings,as well as the usage of large breast cancer and cross-cancer atlases. Results Our findings demonstrate that even small reference datasets can yield accurate deconvolution results, with RCTD and Cell2location exhibiting similar performances across cell-types. Heterogeneous entities, such as myeloids, presented greater challenges for accurate deconvolution compared to more distinct ones, such as epithelial cells. Spatial domains associated with prominent cell types like cancer and stromal cells were detected, although their contributions were systematically under- or over-estimated Additionally, we found that perfect reference-ST matching enhances deconvolution accuracy compared to the usage of cross-patient references. Finally, large breast cancer single-cell atlases composed of a diverse set of patients were also able to provide reliable deconvolution results. Conclusion This study provides important insights into optimizing reference selection for ST deconvolution, highlighting the strengths and limitations of current computational tools in addressing cellular heterogeneity within spatial transcriptomics datasets.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A fundamental question in biology is whether cellular aging is inevitable. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) challenge this paradigm as rare normal cells capable of indefinite in vitro passage. However, the mechanisms underlying ESC lineage immortality remain unresolved. Using long-term live-cell imaging to follow fates of single ESCs, we show here that ESC lineage renewal is achieved through sporadic entry into a state characterized by the expression of two-cell embryo-specific markers. During this state, cells undergo asymmetric divisions, segregating accumulated DNA damage into one daughter lineage destined for elimination, while producing a second lineage that reverts to the pluripotent state. Importantly, the latter lineage exhibits signs of rejuvenation, including reduced DNA damage and enhanced chimeric efficiency. These findings underscore the crucial role of asymmetric cell division in maintaining the long-term health of the ESC lineage against mounting damage within individual cells, a potential model for studying cellular aging and rejuvenation in mammalian cells.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The combination of pooled genetic perturbation screening with single-cell RNA-sequencing has allowed for large-scale profiling of single-cell transcriptional responses, providing valuable insights into gene function and cellular behavior. There is a need for computational methods capable of predicting single-cell responses to novel genetic perturbations, thereby allowing for the efficient exploration of the vast combinatorial space of potential multi-gene perturbations. Optimal transport (OT) presents a compelling framework to model this type of data given the lack of true control-perturbed cell pairings. However, existing neural OT models are generally constrained to the perturbations already seen in training, while the use of OT theory in methods capable of modeling novel genetic perturbations remains limited. To bridge this gap, we present an OT-based method to predict single-cell transcriptional responses to novel genetic perturbations. Leveraging a flexible attention-based aggregation approach, our method integrates gene representations from multiple sources of prior knowledge, spanning from functional descriptions of genes to gene-gene relationships, producing a biologically informed representation of the perturbation. Moreover, we utilize an OT-based loss to align predicted and observed perturbed cell populations, avoiding the need to assign random control-perturbed cell pairings. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the highly competitive performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art methods. Further evaluations on differential expression analysis and genetic interaction modeling demonstrate the biological relevance and potential utility of our model across diverse applications.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study dissects how the short N-terminus of Giardia’s annexin orthologue alpha-1 giardin controls oligomerization and lipid binding, clarifying a mechanism for unconventional protein secretion in a parasitic eukaryote.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Annexins are Ca2+ and membrane-binding proteins conserved across eukaryotes and involved in diverse membrane-associated processes, including unconventional protein secretion (UPS). In the intestinal parasite Giardia lamblia, annexins are represented by a family of 21 proteins termed alpha-giardins, all of which lack classical signal peptides yet are detected at the parasite surface and in the secretome. Here, we present a comprehensive functional analysis of alphaGs, with a particular focus on alpha 1-giardin, a leading vaccine candidate against giardiasis and a putative virulence-associated UPS substrate. We show that alphaGs localize to peripheral endocytic compartments (PECs), specialized endo-lysosomal organelles implicated in protein release, and engage in multiprotein complexes enriched in UPS substrates. Using lipid-binding assays, cross-linking mass spectrometry, and structural modelling, we define conserved and divergent features of G membrane interactions. Focusing on 1G, we combine site-directed mutagenesis, confocal microscopy, and mass photometry to demonstrate a critical role for its short N-terminal region in oligomerization and membrane association. Integration of these data with molecular dynamics simulations reveals how alpha1G&#x27;s oligomeric state and membrane occupancy are regulated at PEC membranes. Together, our findings establish a mechanistic framework for annexin-mediated UPS in Giardia and provide structural insights relevant to parasite virulence and vaccine development.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Abnormal nuclear blebbing occurs in many human diseases and causes nuclear rupture and dysfunction. Nuclear blebbing is caused by chromatin motion via RNA Pol II transcriptional activity and nuclear mechanical weakening. Camptothecin, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, rapidly suppresses nuclear blebbing within hours. We find that camptothecin does not decrease RNA Pol II phosphorylation, but does decrease newly synthesized RNA, likely by stalling RNA Pol II. However, camptothecin treatment suppresses nuclear blebbing more drastically than inhibition of transcription activity by alpha amanitin, suggesting a second mechanism of nuclear blebbing suppression. Dual micromanipulation nuclear force measures revealed camptothecin treatment increased chromatin-based nuclear stiffness but not lamin-based strain stiffening. Thus, inhibition of topoisomerase I via camptothecin drastically suppresses nuclear blebbing by both stalling RNA Pol II and increasing chromatin-based nuclear stiffness.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> RNA velocity enables inference of cell state transitions from single-cell transcriptomics by modeling transcriptional dynamics from spliced and unspliced mRNA. However, existing methods overlook spatial context and struggle to scale to large datasets, limiting insights into tissue organization and dynamic processes. We introduce veloAgent, a deep generative and agent-based framework that estimates gene- and cell-specific transcriptional kinetics while integrating spatial information through agent-based simulations of local microenvironments. By leveraging both molecular and spatial cues, veloAgent improves velocity accuracy and achieves sublinear memory scaling, enabling efficient analysis of large and multi-batch spatial datasets. A distinctive feature of veloAgent is its in silico perturbation module, which allows targeted manipulation of spatial velocity vectors to simulate regulatory interventions and predict their impact on cell fate dynamics.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Cryo-EM and simulations reveal how the eukaryotic bridge-like lipid transporter VPS13A docks to the plasma-membrane scramblase XKR1 to deliver bulk lipids to one leaflet for subsequent scrambling and membrane growth, offering broad mechanistic context for lipid-handling in cells rather than direct origins-of-life chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In eukaryotes, bridge-like lipid-transfer proteins (BLTPs) are central in mediating vesicle-independent lipid transfer between organelles. BLTPs span the cytosolic space between organelles at contact sites, featuring hydrophobic channels for lipids to travel between membranes. How BLTPs cooperate with partner proteins to orchestrate lipid delivery remains mysterious. Here we used cryo-electron microscopy to visualize a complex comprising the prototypical BLTP VPS13A and the plasma membrane localized scramblase XKR1 at near-atomic resolution. VPS13A interacts with XKR1 via its PH-domain, priming VPS13As bridge-like lipid-transfer domain to deliver lipids directly to the cytosolic leaflet of the acceptor membrane. In molecular dynamics simulations, such arrangement allows for robust lipid transfer, accelerated by membrane properties. Newly delivered lipids can then be equilibrated between leaflets of the membrane bilayer by the scramblase, allowing for membrane growth. Mechanistic insights regarding lipid delivery by VPS13A are directly applicable to all VPS13 proteins and all BLTP family members more broadly.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This preprint identifies mitochondrial double-stranded RNA as a major endogenous immunogenic dsRNA source in ADAR1-deficient cells via a proposed mtROS-driven “Draw-and-Release” mechanism, offering RNA/mitochondrial biology insights but only tangential relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) triggers immune responses during viral infections, but self-derived dsRNA can activate similar pathways. To prevent this, the body relies on mechanisms like ADAR1, an RNA-editing enzyme essential for immune regulation. Dysfunction of ADAR1 is linked to various diseases, yet the nature and role of dsRNAs accumulating in its absence remain unclear. Here, we identify mitochondrial dsRNA (mt-dsRNA), transcribed from the mitochondrial genome, as a major contributor to the endogenous dsRNA pool in ADAR1-deficient human and murine cells. We propose a &quot;Draw-and-Release&quot; model, where ADAR1 loss increases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), causing mt-dsRNA accumulation in the mitochondrial matrix (&quot;Draw&quot; phase) and its immune-activating release into the cytosol upon mitochondrial protein dysfunction (&quot;Release&quot; phase). This study highlights the importance of mitochondrial integrity in mitigating ADAR1-related pathologies.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Presents resolveS, a fast reference-free bioinformatics tool to infer RNA-seq library strandedness using conserved rRNA sequences, offering minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Public sequencing data repositories, such as the European Nucleotide Archive and Sequence Read Archive are vital resources for biological discovery, however their associated metadata often lacks essential experimental details, specifically the strand specificity (strandedness) of RNA-sequencing data. Accurate determination of strandedness is critical for downstream analysis, yet existing tools are often limited by computational inefficiency, complex workflows, or a reliance on high-quality, species-specific reference genomes and gene annotations. To address these limitations, we developed resolveS, a rapid, resource-efficient and user-friendly tool designed to detect RNA-sequencing strandedness without requiring organism-specific genomic resources. By leveraging the evolutionary conservation of ribosomal RNA combined with a robust statistical framework, resolveS eliminates the dependency on reference genomes. Benchmarking demonstrates that resolveS outperforms existing methods in both speed and efficiency, processing samples in under 10 seconds with a minimal memory footprint (&lt;0.5 GB). Furthermore, to enhance reproducibility and facilitate seamless integration into bioinformatics pipelines, we provide ready-to-use Singularity and Apptainer images alongside a portable executable version. Availability and ImplementationresolveS is available under the MIT license at (https://github.com/yudalang3/resolveS).

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> A large-scale mass-spectrometry atlas mapping ~18k lysine acetylation sites across 15 mouse tissues, highlighting tissue-shared acetylation and functional examples (ribosome stability and Crat active-site acetylation) mainly relevant to mammalian metabolism/disease rather than origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Lysine acetylation has widespread ramifications from genetic regulatory effects to modulation of enzymatic function. With improved acetyl-lysine enrichment technologies and advances in mass spectrometer speed and sensitivity, we present a comprehensive atlas of the mouse acetylome comprising 17,952 unique lysine acetylation sites across 4,340 proteins and 15 tissues. This resource, which nearly doubles the known mouse acetyl-lysine catalog, shows at least 14% of the acetylome is shared across tissues. We focus our investigation on several acetylated proteins, including ribosomal acetylation and its potential to extend ribosomal half-life in the liver and pancreas. Additionally, we identify a novel acetylation event in the active site of carnitine O-acetyltransferase (Crat) that also mirrors tissue-specific Crat activity. By integrating these data with human pathogenic variants, we identify acetyl-lysine residues on cardiac troponin and homogentisate dioxygenase that likely mimic disease-causing mutations. This resource provides a foundational framework for investigating protein acetylation in metabolic health and disease.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Bioinformatics survey of intrinsically disordered regions in human spliceosome proteins highlights conserved, charged/RS-rich RNA–protein interaction motifs and disease-linked modification/mutation hotspots, with only indirect relevance to Origins-of-Life questions about early RNA–protein assemblies.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Introns are removed from messenger RNAs by the spliceosome, a protein-RNA machinery enriched with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Lacking stable 3D structures, IDRs can adopt diverse conformations interlacing proteins and RNAs components of the spliceosome and regulating splicing. Here we performed a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the human spliceosome proteome revealing that many proteins contain over 40% of disordered residues. Spliceosome IDRs are mainly driven by compositional bias due to an excess of charged and RS-like sequences, with both the nature and extent of this disorder being broadly conserved evolutionarily. Additionally, these IDRs are frequent targets of post-translational modifications, especially phosphorylation, and are hotspots for cancer-associated mutations, implicated in different cancer types. Our results collectively underscore central role of IDRs in splicing regulation and disease.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This preprint demonstrates a mechanics-aware, topology-constrained design framework to engineer de novo exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs that form ring-like folds and robustly stall XRN1 despite minimal sequence similarity to natural xrRNAs, informing how RNA structure alone can encode functional stability.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mechanically active RNAs represent an emerging class of biomolecules whose function derives from resisting molecular forces. Among them, exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs (xr-RNAs) achieve this by folding into a ring-like topology that physically blocks 5 [-&gt;] 3 degra-dation. However, despite years of structural insight, the rational design of such mechanically functional RNA devices has remained elusive. Here, we describe a mechanics-aware RNA design approach that enables de novo engineering of functional xrRNAs. We first identify structural determinants of force resistance by perturbing pseudoknot architecture in a model xrRNA and quantifying resulting efficiencies in the stalling of exoribonuclease XRN1. We then implement these rules in a design framework that integrates explicit topological constraints with molecular dynamics-guided optimization. The resulting synthetic xrRNAs reproduce the ring-like architecture and stall exoribonuclease XRN1 with wild-type-like efficiency. Our top-performing constructs exhibit minimal sequence similarity to known xrRNAs and evade detection by covariance models, yet remain fully functional in vitro. Together, our results show that mechanical function can be rationally designed independent of evolutionary ancestry, laying the groundwork for the design of RNA elements that modulate decay and fine-tune the mechanical stability of engineered transcripts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Propolis, a resinous substance produced by Apis mellifera, is rich in polyphenols and flavonoids and exhibits diverse biological activities, including antioxidant and antimicrobial effects. This study aimed to characterize the chemical composition of Thai propolis and evaluate its free radical scavenging activity. Ethanolic (EEP) and aqueous (WEP) extracts were prepared and analyzed. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) identified major constituents of EEP, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, and sugars. Antioxidant activities were assessed using DPPH and hydrogen peroxide scavenging assays. EEP exhibited significantly higher radical scavenging activity than WEP, with maximum DPPH inhibition of 87.46% at 5 mg/mL. CAPE effectively scavenged superoxide and hydroxyl radicals and protected plasmid DNA from oxidative damage. These results highlight CAPE as bioactive compound contributing to the antioxidant properties of Thai propolis. Thai propolis, particularly its ethanolic extract, represents a promising natural source of antioxidants for potential applications in nutraceuticals, functional foods, and oxidative stress-related disease prevention.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) mediates the formation of biomolecular condensates, which organize cellular processes such as synaptic plasticity and stress response. The neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau undergoes LLPS under specific conditions, regulating synaptic vesicle clustering and microtubule dynamics. In vitro, tau LLPS is induced by cofactors such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or RNA, mainly via weak multivalent electrostatic interactions. However, the molecular mechanisms governing the formation of tau LLPS, including domain specific contribution, remain unclear. In this study, we used eight single-domain antibodies (VHHs), targeting six distinct short sequences of tau, to explore the mechanisms of tau LLPS in vitro. By combining several biophysical methods, we evaluated the effect of each anti-tau VHH on tau LLPS with two main LLPS inducers, PEG (molecular crowding) and RNA (complex coacervation). With PEG as an inducer, all VHHs targeting tau enhanced tau LLPS formation, regardless of their affinity for tau. With RNA as an inducer, the effect of the VHHs was mixed: VHHs targeting the C-terminal domain promoted condensation, while VHH B1-1, which binds the proline-rich domain (PRD; including residues (221REPKKVAVVRTP232), abolished droplet formation. NMR and surface plasmon resonance confirmed 1 to 1 binding of VHH B1-1 to the PRD, and competition assays with a PRD peptide restored LLPS, demonstrating mechanistic specificity. This result underscores the importance of this region in tau LLPS formation. Our findings provide domain-resolved insights into the regulation of tau LLPS and demonstrate the potential of VHHs as tools to selectively modulate biomolecular condensates in physiological and pathological contexts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> TnpB is a compact RNA-guided endonuclease and evolutionary ancestor of CRISPR-Cas12 that offers a promising platform for genome engineering. However, the genome-editing activity of TnpBs remains limited and its underlying determinants are poorly understood. Here, we used biochemical and single-molecule assays to examine the DNA-unwinding mechanism of Youngiibacter multivorans TnpB (Ymu1 TnpB). DNA unwinding proceeds through formation of a partially unwound intermediate state to a fully unwound open state. The open state forms inefficiently and collapses readily in the absence of negative supercoiling. An optimized variant, Ymu1-WFR, stabilizes formation of both the intermediate and open states, resulting in enhanced DNA cleavage in vitro and increased genome editing in vivo. These findings identify the physical basis for the observed minimal activities of natural TnpBs, revealing how stabilizing specific unwinding states enables efficient DNA targeting.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) is a nucleic acid-like heterogeneous polymer in nature. Recently, it was found to engage in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), generating condensates as an emerging class of subcellular structures with pivotal functions in response to stimuli. As a post-translational modification catalyzed by PAR polymerases (PARPs), PAR is known to modulate many key events in cells. However, its involvement in biomolecular condensation remains elusive. Through an imaging-based screening of small molecules with diverse biological activities, we here discovered that PAR undergoes LLPS upon inhibiting proteasome in different types of cells, resulting in co-condensation of PAR with proteasome and ubiquitin chains in nucleus. This unprecedented co-condensation is dependent on PARP2 not PARP1 and requires K6-linked ubiquitylation. PAR is shown for the first time to directly interact with ubiquitin chains. Notably, stalled DNA replication forks arose from proteasome inhibition are co-localized with PAR-proteasome-ubiquitin chain condensates. By attenuating replication and stabilizing stalled replication forks, PAR-proteasome-ubiquitin chain condensates sustain genomic integrity under proteasomal stress.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Background Myogenic differentiation of muscle stem cells required for skeletal muscle growth and regeneration relies on the precise spatiotemporal coordination of multiple gene-expression programs. Over the past decades, considerable progress has been made in defining the transcriptional networks that govern myogenesis. In particular, myogenic transcription factors integrate extrinsic and intrinsic cues to drive skeletal muscle development and regeneration. In contrast, post-transcriptional layers of regulation have remained comparatively underexplored. Among these, the epitranscriptome -- comprising more than 170 chemical RNA modifications -- has recently emerged as a major regulatory axis in cellular differentiation. N-methyladenosine (mA), the most abundant internal modification of mRNA, is now recognized as a key regulator of stem-cell fate decisions across multiple biological systems. By dynamically modulating RNA stability, translation, and other processing steps, mA enables precise fine-tuning of gene-expression programs in response to physiological cues. These effects are mediated through mA-binding RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), also referred to as readers, which selectively recognize methylated transcripts and translate the modification into functional cellular outcomes. Despite its central role in other tissue contexts, the contribution of mA to skeletal muscle physiology -- and particularly to human muscle stem cell biology -- remains poorly characterized. This gap represents a critical and largely unexplored frontier in muscle biology. Methods To define the epitranscriptome landscape during the myogenic differentiation of human skeletal muscle cells, we performed GLORI on proliferating and differentiated human primary myoblasts. This recently developed approach enables detection of mA at single-nucleotide resolution together with quantitative measurement of methylation stoichiometry at individual sites. mA-modified positions were mapped across the transcriptome in both cellular states and integrated with matched RNA-seq datasets data to contextualise mA features relative to transcript abundance. To place these findings in a broader context, we compared our human mA maps with previously published mouse muscle cell datasets and overlaid them with available CLIP-seq datasets of mA RNA-binding proteins. Results We identified tens of thousands of high-confidence mA sites in proliferating and differentiated human myogenic cells. While many sites were shared between states, myogenic differentiation was accompanied by epitranscriptomic remodeling, affecting both the distribution and stoichiometry of mA marks. Transcripts exhibiting differential mA regulation were enriched for pathways related to myogenic development, cytoskeletal remodeling, signalling, nucleic-acid-associated processes and energy metabolism. Joint analysis of mA site number, methylation stoichiometry, and expression levels indicated the presence of distinct mA regulatory frameworks at the transcript level. Genes associated with myogenesis and regulatory pathways were distributed across these categories, consistent with the coexistence of multiple regulatory programs during myogenic differentiation. In addition, cross-species comparisons revealed the presence of human-specific methylation patterns. Integration with published mA RNA-binding protein datasets uncovered distinct subsets of mA sites with varying binding profiles, suggesting state-dependent interpretation of mA marks. Together, these data constitute, to our knowledge, the first single-nucleotide-resolution atlas of mA methylation in human skeletal muscle, revealing a previously uncharacterized epitranscriptomic landscape and providing a foundational resource for studies of human myogenesis.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> DNA replication in multicellular organisms follows a tightly regulated spatio-temporal program. Although the mechanisms underlying this replication program remain only partially understood, studies in model systems such as Xenopus laevis have highlighted the importance of titrating low-abundance replication factors. Whole-genome duplications as a consequence of polyploidization introduce additional layers of complexity, yet comparative analyses of replication programs across closely related polyploid species are scarce. Here, we developed an interspecies in vitro replication system using X. laevis egg extracts and sperm nuclei from three Xenopus species with varying ploidy: diploid (X. tropicalis), tetraploid (X. laevis), and dodecaploid (X. eysoole). Replication in diploid X. tropicalis was faster than in tetraploid X. laevis nuclei, due to higher fork density and speed. Surprisingly, dodecaploid X. eysoole replication was also accelerated compared to tetraploid nuclei, suggesting that higher ploidy does not necessarily extend S phase. Since replication genes are highly conserved between these species, these results imply dynamic tuning of replication programs across polyploid species and shed light on the evolutionary adaptability of DNA replication in response to genome duplication.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The regulation of gene expression requires precise control of chromatin-associated complexes that respond to diverse structural and epigenetic cues. The Rpd3 Large (Rpd3L) complex is a Sin3 histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex that dynamically adapt to chromatin states to reinforce transcriptional silencing, yet the mechanisms governing the catalytic activation in chromatin context-dependent manner remain unclear. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of Rpd3L bound to both mono- and di-nucleosome substrate at near-atomic resolution, uncovering a substrate-guided allosteric activation mechanism. Rpd3L adopts an asymmetric architecture, in which the proximal catalytic module anchors the first nucleosome, while the Sin3 PAH domains engage linker DNA to reposition a second nucleosome. This spatial configuration brings the distal catalytic module into proximity with chromatin and unlocks its latent deacetylase activity. Biochemical and mass spectrometry analyses confirm that dual nucleosome engagement selectively enhances Rpd3L activity and broadens substrate specificity. Together, these findings establish a hierarchical mechanism by which Rpd3L interprets histone modifications and nucleosome organization to modulate its enzymatic output at promoter regions. Our study provides a framework for understanding higher-order chromatin repression mechanisms by chromatin-regulation complexes and co-repressors.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are toxic DNA lesions formed by the covalent attachment of proteins to DNA. Failure to resolve DPCs leads to genomic instability, premature aging, and cancer predisposition. Although multiple proteases and the 26S proteasome degrade DPCs, how these lesions are detected and marked for proteolysis remains unclear. Here, we show that poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP1/2) sense DPCs and modify them with poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) to promote repair via a SPRTN-Tdp1 axis. We discovered a Nudix homology domain (NHD) in SPRTN that mediates direct non-covalent PAR binding and is important for DPC repair. Loss of PARP1/2 activity or mutation of the SPRTN NHD leads to sustained DPCs. Single-molecule analysis revealed that SPRTN does not bind efficiently to the DPC, however after the addition of PARP1 in the presence of NAD+, SPRTN binding to the DPC was significantly increased. Our findings establish PARP1/2 enzymes as immediate DPC sensors, reveal PARylation as a signal marking DPCs for SPRTN-dependent degradation, and identify SPRTN as the first PARP-directed protease.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are transcriptional regulators that orchestrate the canonical response to low-oxygen tension in animal cells. Vertebrates possess three HIF-a isoforms, which arose from two gene duplication events of the ancestral HIF-1a gene. Here, we examined whether the HIF gene family (HIF-1a, HIF-2a, HIF-3a, and HIF-1aN inhibitor) shows evidence of positive selection in hypoxia-tolerant reptiles (Testudines), compared evolutionary patterns within the family, and assessed the transcriptional response to hypoxia in primary cells derived from a hypoxia-tolerant (Caretta caretta) and a non-tolerant (Sceloporus occidentalis) reptile. We found that HIF-1a, HIF-2a, and HIF-1aN are highly conserved across reptiles, whereas HIF-3a is under positive selection in Testudines. We also identified multiple novel regulatory motifs unique to Testudines. Transcriptional signatures of hypoxia exposure indicated stark differences between lizards and turtles. Whereas lizard cells exhibited a canonical response to hypoxia, characterized by enriched cell-survival pathways, sea turtle cells exhibit a robust, distinctive transcriptional response involving enriched pathways related to protein synthesis, quality maintenance, and mitochondrial integrity. Surprisingly, cis-regulatory element analysis did not show HIFs as key regulators of the transcriptional response in either species. Instead, TFDP1 in lizard cells and E2F1 in sea turtle cells emerged as potential key regulators. TFDP1 regulates the cell cycle, specifically DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression, while E2F regulates DNA-damage response, apoptosis, metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis. These results suggest that the reptilian response to hypoxia is shaped by transcriptional plasticity, while highlighting key regulatory mechanisms driving hypoxic adaptation in sea turtle cells. However, positive selection of HIF-3a and novel HIF motifs suggest a combined, but yet to be uncovered, contribution of regulatory and coding sequence evolutionary mechanisms shaping hypoxia tolerance in Testudines.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single-molecule tracking (SMT) in live cells reveals how biomolecules explore crowded intracellular environments, yet most tracking software assumes Brownian motion, an approximation that fails when anomalous diffusion dominates. This leads to biased trajectory reconstruction and loss of biophysical information, particularly for the short trajectories typical of intracellular experiments. We present FreeTrace, an SMT framework that reconstructs trajectories under fractional Brownian motion (fBm), incorporating temporal correlations directly into linking with minimal input parameters. A deep neural network estimates diffusion properties (Hurst exponent H and generalised diffusion coefficient K) for individual trajectories, while an analytical ensemble estimator accurately recovers H from trajectories as short as three frames, conditions where mean-squared displacement methods fail. Benchmarking on simulated data demonstrates superior performance across motion types and densities. Applications to chromatin-bound histones, DNA repair proteins in S.c. yeast and human cells reveal biologically meaningful diffusion subpopulations, with H values consistent with polymer models and confined motion. FreeTrace bridges theoretical anomalous diffusion models and routine biological experiments.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Faithful chromosome segregation requires the coordinated assembly and maintenance of kinetochore complexes. However, the homeostatic mechanisms that maintain these multi-subunit assemblies remain unclear. CENP-T is a chromatin-bound linker that recruits the outer kinetochore modules via the CENP-T-W-S-X complex to form a functional kinetochore. Although CENP-T must be continuously replenished, how its steady-state levels are maintained is unknown. Here we demonstrate that CENP-T homeostasis is actively sustained by two spatially distinct pathways. Using covalent pulse-labeling, we find that CENP-T undergoes cell-cycle-coupled turnover rather than being stably inherited. In situ proximity labeling of chromatin-bound and soluble pools identifies regulators of CENP-T stability, including an unexpected role for the CENP-O complex in stabilizing soluble CENP-T. Mechanistically, CENP-S-X stabilizes chromatin-bound CENP-T through DNA-binding, whereas the CENP-O complex buffers a replenishment-competent CENP-T pool. Together, these conserved, spatially compartmentalized pathways establish an actively maintained homeostatic system that ensures robust kinetochore assembly and faithful chromosome segregation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Approximately 60% of the tumour suppressor protein BRCA1 is encoded by a single exon. Many tumours carry mutations in this exon, often resulting in exon skipping and thus a protein of a severely reduced size. Although none of the well-described protein domains of BRCA1 are encoded by this exon 11, the isoform lacking this part shows a hypomorphic activity in homologous recombination. To better understand the function of this large exon, we performed proteomic analyses to identify interaction partners via this part of the protein. Here, we report a DNA damage- and phospho-dependent interaction of TOPBP1 to the protein region of BRCA1 encoded by exon 11. Mechanistically, this interaction is required for the role of BRCA1 in end-resection during homologous recombination. In contrast, the interaction is not required for the role of TOPBP1 in ATR activation. Our data provide novel mechanistic insight into the function of this poorly characterized part of the BRCA1 protein.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Telomeres, repetitive DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes, are increasingly studied as biomarkers of physiological stress as well as ageing processes. In ichthyology, fish scales provide valuable information regarding life history and ageing and are thus often preserved in substantial collections. This study aims to adapt a quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) method to estimate relative telomere length (RTL) from fish scales archived in such collections. Using the brown trout (Salmo trutta) as a model species, we show that archived scales contain enough DNA to perform qPCR-based RTL measurement. RTLs in scales are on average higher than in fins, however we found no significant correlation between RTL values of both tissues at the individual level. Analysing archived scales originating from the subantarctic Kerguelen Islands introduced brown trout populations, we find substantial variation in RTL between rivers, age classes and body size.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> While cap-dependent translation is the eukaryotic norm, alternative pathways enable selective protein synthesis during stress. We describe a cap-independent mechanism regulating NbRabGAP1, a host factor essential for bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) movement in Nicotiana benthamiana. The 5&#x27; untranslated region (5&#x27; UTR, 553-nt) of NbRabGAP1 contains three upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that typically hinder ribosome scanning. Using bicistronic reporter assays, we identified a functional internal ribosome entry site (IRES) within nucleotides 61-150. This IRES features a predicted stable Y-shaped RNA structure and a purine-rich R-motif. We demonstrate that NbPAB8, a poly(A)-binding protein, specifically binds this R-motif to enhance IRES-mediated translation over 2.5-fold. During BaMV infection, NbPAB8 expression is transiently upregulated, coinciding with maintained NbRabGAP1 levels despite potential repression of global cap-dependent translation. This represents a regulatory switch where viral infection triggers a PAB8-dependent IRES mechanism to sustain the vesicle trafficking machinery required for viral movement. Our findings reveal how viral stress rewires host translational control through specific RNA-protein interactions, ensuring the synthesis of critical host factors via IRES-mediated pathways. HighlightDuring bamboo mosaic virus infection, NbPAB8 binds a purine-rich IRES in the NbRabGAP1 5&#x27; UTR, bypassing global translation repression to maintain vesicle trafficking essential for viral movement.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding why some traits are maintained whereas others are repeatedly lost is a central question in evolutionary biology. Here, we address this problem through an analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of autoregulation of the prfB gene, which encodes peptide-chain release factor 2 (RF2), a key factor in bacterial translation termination. RF2 recognizes UGA and UAA stop codons and catalyzes the release of the completed polypeptide. In many species, prfB contains an internal UGA stop codon, triggering premature translation termination by RF2 itself. Complete RF2 translation depends on a +1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) event on the internal stop codon, which occurs more frequently when RF2 levels are low, resulting in autoregulation of prfB expression. While widespread, this autoregulatory mechanism has been lost in multiple bacterial lineages. We combined phylogenetics, experimental evolution and molecular genetics to investigate the evolutionary forces behind this loss. We found no significant correlation between PRF loss and stop codon usage using phylogenetically informed analyses, and PRF disruption in Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 had no detectable fitness effect. However, engineered mutations that reduced frameshifting caused fitness defects, which were compensated by two classes of mutation: (i) mutations that impair specific ribosomal proteins, and (ii) single-nucleotide deletions in prfB that adjust the reading frame and bypass the internal stop codon. These results suggest that compensatory mutations facilitate the loss of prfB autoregulation under RF2-limiting conditions. We discuss three potential scenarios that could account for this process.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Computational framework (TRAEV) predicts how microbial metabolic traits erode or persist under adaptive evolution in specific environments, validated in engineered yeast and applied to wine-aroma traits.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In industrial applications, microbial strains undergo notable biomass expansion subjecting them to Darwinian selection. The consequent adaptive evolution may threaten the often tediously developed desired traits of the strains, such as flavor or platform chemical production. Yet, it remains unresolved how to predict the evolutionary trait robustness. Here, we propose TRAEV (Trait Robustness Against EVolution), a computational framework for in silico prediction of evolutionary trajectories and robustness of desired metabolic traits in application environments. TRAEV uses constraint-based metabolic model simulations to predict environment-dependent trait-fitness dependencies and Monte Carlo-based perturbation analysis to account for the stochasticity of adaptive evolution. First, TRAEV predicts the immediate phenotypic adaptation to the new environment, and then, the evolutionary trajectories of fitness and desired trait by sampling enzyme usage changes. From the predicted trajectories, trait robustness is quantified as two scores: Robustness Score (RS) and Trade-off Score (TS). RS and TS are the mean of a normalized desired trait and the mean of the product of normalized changes in the desired trait and in fitness, respectively, over intermediate metabolic states along the evolutionary trajectory. We validated TRAEV by demonstrating that it predicted the relative robustness of heterologous pigmentation of genetically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains in synthetic defined chemical environments aligned with experimental observations. We then further applied TRAEV to predictively assess the robustness of desired aroma generation trait in a wine must environment by multiple S. cerevisiae strains if they were developed via a laboratory selection process. Thus, we showed how TRAEV predictions could guide such strain development. TRAEV can be integrated into computational strain design workflows across microbial strains, metabolic traits, and application environments. Ultimately, model-predicted evolutionary robustness of desired traits can guide both strain and process development and help avoiding production losses and enhancing the economic attractiveness of industrial applications using microbial cells.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Population genomics of Atlantic hydrothermal-vent Rimicaris shrimp reveals high ridge-wide gene flow and recent divergence/secondary contact among ecotypes with contrasting symbioses, informing vent ecosystem connectivity rather than directly addressing origins-of-life mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Conservation concerns regarding potential mineral extraction near deep-sea hydrothermal vents have emphasised the need for a better understanding of the contemporary connectivity of various vent-endemic species, accounting for the specifics of their life-history traits and habitat requirements. Rimicaris shrimps are a major component of vent communities in the Atlantic Ocean, both along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) and at the Mid-Cayman Spreading Center (MCSC). Using ddRAD sequencing, we examined the genetic differentiation of three Atlantic Rimicaris species to better understand their past and present migration pathways and the possible demographic history that led to their current distribution and ecology. Rimicaris exoculata and R. chacei inhabit the MAR and exhibit widespread gene flow along the ridge with no areas of restricted connectivity. R. hybisae occurs at the MCSC and exhibits almost no genetic difference with its congeneric from the MAR, R. chacei, despite the geographic distance between them and their contrasting ecologies and morphologies. Demographic inferences support a scenario of a very recent (less than 2000 generations) separation between MCSC and MAR shrimp populations, followed by a rapid expansion in both regions, possibly triggered by symbiotic development. Analyses further suggest recent or ongoing secondary contacts involving two-way migration, which is more pronounced from the MCSC towards the MAR. All together these results suggest that R. chacei and R. hybisae represent distinct forms of the same species, which we hereby synonymise as R. chacei, highlighting their morphological plasticity in relation to symbiosis.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Experimental evolution and genomic scans in a tiny-genome eukaryotic pest show generalism under fluctuating environments is likely polygenic and linked to stress/detox pathways, offering only indirect context for astrobiology via adaptation rather than origins-of-life mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In agricultural systems, spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments are expected to favour the evolution of generalist pests and pathogens, yet the genomic mechanisms underlying niche-breadth expansion remain poorly understood. Here, we address this gap by assembling one of the smallest known eukaryotic genomes--from the global cereal pest Aceria tosichella--and by resequencing generalist and specialist populations which evolved in the lab on constant versus fluctuating hosts. A previous study demonstrated that generalist populations retained a wider niche, including the ability to exploit a refuge host, compared to specialist populations that showed a narrowing of the ecological niche. Genomic scans identified 640 SNPs that significantly differed in frequency between treatments, including a single highly differentiated 120-kbp region containing 13 genes. Allele-frequency shifts across many SNPs in this region paralleled phenotypic divergence in the ability to utilise refuge hosts, and gene annotations suggested their roles in starvation resistance and nutrient signalling. However, experimental validation of the top candidate gene did not support its strong direct effect on survival on the refuge host, implying a more complex, likely polygenic basis for adaptation. Consistent with this interpretation, numerous significant SNPs occurred outside the focal region, with enrichment for genes involved in xenobiotic transport, detoxification pathways, and ABC transporters. Together, these results indicate that generalism in A. tosichella relies on complex molecular mechanisms that enable survival on suboptimal or refuge hosts, relying to a considerable extent on the ability to deal with stress arising, for example, from toxic compounds present in suboptimal hosts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> During early embryogenesis, the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) undergoes a dramatic form of genome reprogramming wherein specific chromosomes are selectively eliminated from somatic progenitor cells. These programmatic elimination events effectively silence all genes on these chromosomes in all somatic cells. Previous studies in lamprey and other eliminating species have shown that epigenetic silencing marks are enriched on germline-specific chromosomes during programmed elimination. These silencing marks include the histone marks H3K9me3 and H4K20me3, which are respectively deposited by KMT1A/SUV39 and KMT5/SUV420 methyltransferases. To test whether lamprey homologs of these methyltransferases contribute to deposition of silencing marks on eliminated (micronucleated) chromatin and whether these marks contribute to the highly coordinated process of DNA elimination in sea lamprey, we used Cas9 gene editing, lightsheet imaging and RNA sequencing to investigate their potential roles in DNA elimination and more generally during early development. Analysis of knockout embryos for four histone methyltransferases show that these genes contribute to the deposition of repressive histone marks on elimination micronuclei, but are not essential for programmed DNA elimination per se. Analysis of later embryogenic stages suggests that these marks may contribute to interim silencing of germline-specific chromosomes, and reveals major impacts on post-blastula survival and development.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding how reproductive isolation (RI) evolves in the context of gene flow is central to explaining how new species arise. Theory predicts that the accumulation of barrier loci is shaped by the interplay between divergent selection, recombination, and genomic architecture, yet empirical tests spanning multiple stages of divergence at the intraspecific level remain rare. The pea aphid complex, comprising multiple sympatric biotypes specialised on different legume hosts and spanning a continuum of RI, provides an exceptional opportunity to examine how ecological adaptation drives reproductive isolation under ongoing gene flow. Using whole-genome sequencing data from 13 sympatric European biotypes, we constructed a dense, reference-genome anchored picture of the divergence continuum that controls for genetic background and recombination landscape. Joint patterns of genetic differentiation, absolute divergence and genetic diversity, as well as recombination and introgression rates, reveal a consistent signature of divergence with gene flow and allow robust identification of barrier loci. Across the divergence gradient, RI is highly polygenic, yet barrier loci are clustered and enriched in low-recombination regions and large chromosomal rearrangements, which promote strong linkage disequilibrium and coupling among barrier effects. While genome-wide FST and the number of barrier loci gradually accumulate as divergence increases, the dynamics of differentiation within barrier loci show stepwise increases consistent with theoretical &quot;tipping points&quot; in the accumulation of RI. Barrier loci are enriched in salivary effector, detoxification and chemosensory genes, highlighting their central role in host plant specialisation and RI. These candidate genes are dynamically recruited at different stages of divergence, and some of them are shared among independent biotype comparisons, suggesting generic functional determinants of host plant specialisation and reproductive isolation acquired via parallel evolution or introgression. Our study provides a comprehensive view of the genomic architecture and evolutionary dynamics underlying speciation with gene flow, illustrating how tightly linked, polygenic architectures can facilitate adaptation and diversification in natural populations.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Reports a newly evolved toxin–antidote selfish genetic module in nematodes, suggesting sequential evolution (antidote first, then domesticated microbial-derived toxin) driven by host–pathogen conflict, informing how genetic conflict and reproductive barriers can arise.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Toxin-antidote (TA) systems are selfish genetic elements that promote their own inheritance by selectively eliminating offspring lacking the module, thereby establishing post-zygotic genetic incompatibilities between individuals and populations. Although these systems are widespread across species, their evolutionary origins remain poorly understood. Here, we report the discovery of a novel TA gene pair in the nematode Caenorhabditis nigoni. The antidote gene, Cni-shls-2, is a species-specific F-box gene that arose through recent tandem duplications. Its absence results in embryonic lethality in both C. nigoni and its hybrids with the sister species C. briggsae. This lethality is caused by a maternally deposited toxin, Cni-hlix-1, a chimeric gene formed through the fusion of host and bacterial sequences. Phylogenetic and genomic analyses reveal a sequential evolution of the TA system, in which the antidote evolved prior to the toxin. The stepwise evolution of TA and the potential microbial origin of the toxin support the hypothesis that the antidote initially evolved in response to pathogen exposure, followed by the domestication of the toxin, thereby elucidating the origins of TA formation. These findings highlight the central role of host-pathogen conflict as a driving force in the emergence of genetic incompatibilities and the evolution of reproductive barriers.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many RNA molecules function within confined environments, but the effect of confinement on RNA folding remains poorly understood. Proximity ligation experiments reveal altered long-range contacts in confined versus unconfined states, yet they do not explain how spatial constraints give rise to these differences. Here, we develop a physical modeling approach that incorporates proximity ligation data into coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to reconstruct RNA 3D structures under confinement. We test our model on the ~11 kb genome of the Zika virus, comparing the folding in virions (confined) and in cells (unconfined). We observe that the probability of contact between two regions of the genome vs. linear distance follows different scaling laws in the confined and unconfined cases, in agreement with proximity ligation experiments. We find that genome circularization -- an interaction that regulates replication in Zika -- occurs more frequently under confinement in both experiments and simulations. Our model reveals that the formation of long double-stranded stems through stacking confers local nematic liquid crystalline order to the RNA, and predicts pseudoknot topologies consistent with those seen in crystallographic structures of shorter RNAs. These results provide insight into the mechanism through which confinement alters the ensemble of 3D structures accessible to a long RNA molecule.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The photoprotective efficacy of natural skin-active complexes is well recognized, yet their application is often hindered by the challenge of deciphering their complex, multi-component, and multi-target mechanisms. To bridge the gap between established phenotypes and molecular mechanisms, we developed an AI-driven integrated platform that combines phytochemical profiling, network pharmacology, and deep learning-based target prediction with rigorous biophysical validation. We applied this platform to investigate RRBE, a bioactive complex refined from red rice bran extract. In vivo clinical studies confirmed that RRBE significantly accelerates the resolution of UV-induced erythema, while cellular and 3D tissue models demonstrated robust suppression of oxidative stress and DNA damage responses. To decode its material basis, the platform deconstructed RRBE into 10 distinct chemical modules. Leveraging our SCOPE-DTI deep learning model for global target prediction, we identified flavonoids (Module 1) and phenolic acids (Module 10) as the primary bioactive drivers relevant to photoprotection. These computational predictions were structurally supported by molecular docking and definitively validated in a physiological environment via Cellular Thermal Shift Assay-Mass Spectrometry (CETSA-MS). Mechanistically, RRBE functions through a synergistic polypharmacology: (1) Module 1 components, represented by procyanidin B2, target NDUFA7 to stabilize mitochondrial function and mitigate ROS; (2) Module 10 components, exemplified by caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid, engage FKBP11 and HSP90AA1 to regulate protein homeostasis and stress responses. This work not only deciphers the polypharmacological basis of RRBEs photoprotective action but also validates a scalable &quot;AI-guided, cell-validated&quot; discovery pipeline, offering a rational paradigm for uncovering the protective benefits of complex natural extracts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cytomotive filaments, a prominent class of cytoskeletal polymers comprising the actin and tubulin families, combine directional growth with monomer turnover to perform essential cellular functions. While the functional role of turnover is becoming increasingly clear, how these filaments dynamically self-assemble using a single monomer type remains an open question. Here we exploit physical modelling in combination with genetic algorithms to elucidate the design principles that drive monomer self-assembly into treadmilling filaments - polar filaments that grow on one end and shrink on the other. We first show that directional polymer growth is only possible when a structurally polar monomer changes conformation upon polymerisation, and identify three different mechanisms through which the structural polarity of a monomer can induce kinetic polarity. We then prove that to prevent filament fragmentation and promote end depolymerisation upon nucleotide hydrolysis, the conformation change of a polar monomer must involve both its interface-forming sites. Combining these results, we identify the principles required to design treadmilling monomers, and showcase the emergence of treadmilling dynamics from the bottom-up. Our work sheds light on the physical mechanisms underlying cytomotive self-assembly of biological polymers, and lays the base for the realization of essential cytoskeletal features in synthetic systems with programmable building blocks.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> In replicated selection experiments, fatty-acid vesicle populations show an increased turbidity phenotype consistent with emergent cooperative, inheritance-like dynamics during growth/division—supporting the plausibility of pre-genetic (protocell) evolution in prebiotic chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Adaptive evolution has long been hypothesized to be possible in the absence of genetic molecules, but experimental evidence remains lacking. Fatty acid vesicles represent an intriguing model to study the emergence of prebiotic evolution, since they can spontaneously grow and divide and have been hypothesized to be capable of non-genetic inheritance. In this study we conducted multiple experiments to test whether vesicle populations can respond to artificial selection for greater turbidity and, if so, whether that response can be tied to an inheritance-like mechanism. We prepared 96 independent vesicle populations, incubated them for 24 hours and then selected half the populations to propagate into the next generation. The populations to propagate were picked either randomly ,representing drift controls, or were the populations with the greatest turbidity, representing selection. Population propagation involved resuspension, transfer into fresh buffer, feeding with an amphiphile stock, and then incubating for the next 24 hours. In three replicate experiments run for at least 10 generations, we observed consistently greater turbidity in selection lineages compared to drift, as well as a reduction in the heritability (i.e., the correlation between parent and offspring turbidities). We conducted additional experiments to evaluate whether this response to selection is caused by a simple carryover effect or reflects cooperative dynamics, where vesicles from the parental generation affect newly formed vesicles in the offspring generation. The response to selection is much lower if we omitted the resuspension step and/or if we did not feed transfers with amphiphiles but instead mixed them we pre-formed vesicles. Combined with imaging and other analyses of the resuspension and feeding process, these results suggest that cooperative vesicle dynamics occur, where a small number of intact vesicles from a parental generation alters the dynamics of new vesicle formation following food addition. Overall, this study represents the first experimental finding of a response to artificial selection in prebiotic chemistry.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Rising energy needs, the threat of climate change, and the diminishing reserves of non-renewable energy underscore the urgency for advancing alternative, sustainable, clean energy sources. Hydrogen is currently appraised as a logical, sustainable power source, with electrochemical water splitting emerging as a critical method for its production. Water oxidation, a key step in artificial photosynthesis, remains a significant challenge in the development of sustainable energy systems. Transition metal complexes have emerged as promising catalysts for this reaction due to their tunable structures and remarkable catalytic properties. Among the various factors influencing their performance, hydrogen bonding has gained increasing attention as a critical element in shaping catalytic efficiency and reaction pathways. The review explores the multifaceted role of hydrogen bonding in transition metal-based water oxidation catalysts, highlighting its impact on structural stability, proton transfer dynamics, and electronic modulation of active sites. We discuss recent advancements in understanding how hydrogen-bonding interactions influence catalytic activity and selectivity, drawing on both experimental findings and computational insights. By shedding light on the pivotal role of hydrogen bonding, this review aims to inspire innovative approaches for designing next-generation catalysts for sustainable water-splitting technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) is a promising valorisation route to upgrade the biodiesel by-product while co-producing green hydrogen at the cathode in electrolysers. However, the working mechanism of transition-metal-based catalysts such as Ni(OH)₂ remains poorly understood. Here, we employed a multi-operando spectroelectrochemical approach combining UV–Vis optical spectroscopy, soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and time-resolved stepped-potential spectroscopy to investigate the active oxidising species and charge-transfer dynamics under OER and GOR conditions. We identified the NiOOH (Ni3+) as the active species for GOR, whereas the formation of higher valent NiOO (Ni4+) species is completely suppressed in the presence of glycerol. The accumulation of surface adsorbed glycerol molecules is rate-determining, (τ ~ 27.9 s at 1.47 VRHE), occuring slower than the intrinsic catalytic step of glycerol reaction ( τ ~ 3.2 s at 1.47 VRHE), which involves oxidation and bond cleavage. In contrast, OER has significantly slower kinetics (τ ~167 s at 1.47 VRHE), resulting in the dominance of GOR and suppresion of oxygen evolution in the presence of glycerol. The potential-independent production of formic acid during GOR follows an apparent first-order dependence on NiOOH concentration, suggesting continuous C-C bond cleavage activated by reactive *O species. These findings link oxidising species with charge-transfer dynamics, providing insight for the rational design of Ni-based catalysts for glycerol and other biomass-derived molecule oxidations.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> In-situ TEM reveals multistep humidity-driven swelling, deliquescence, and drying-induced salt formation in mixed phthalic acid/NaCl aerosols, improving mechanistic understanding of aerosol water uptake with only indirect relevance to origins-of-life via planetary climate/chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Atmospheric aerosol water uptake properties influence cloud formation and precipitation, atmospheric chemistry, and global climate. Atmospheric aerosols often contain organic acids and inorganic hygroscopic salts, and their internal mixing influences water uptake properties in complex and non-intuitive ways. The heterogeneous nature of aerosol ensembles necessitates nanoscale visualization of aerosol mixing state and water uptake dynamics to uncover mechanistic details. Here we demonstrate that water uptake in phthalic acid (PTA)/sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosols proceeds by PTA swelling, NaCl deliquescence, and droplet growth, while subsequent drying creates core-shell particles containing newly formed sodium phthalate salts. Lab-made individual PTA/NaCl aerosols consisted of cuboidal crystalline NaCl domains phase separated from amorphous PTA domains. Sodium ions were observed in both NaCl and PTA domains, which were separated by a ~10 nm thick interphase with distinct composition and structure. Humidity controlled in-situ TEM imaging revealed PTA/NaCl aerosols initially uptake water by adsorption and swelling of the PTA. Further increases in humidity cause NaCl deliquescence, hygroscopic droplet growth, and partial dissolution and morphology changes in the PTA. Dehumidification initially causes precipitation of an organic-rich shell followed by a polycrystalline NaCl core, yielding a distinctly different core-shell morphology compared to the as-made particles. Diffraction and elemental mapping confirm crystalline sodium acid phthalate forms following dehumidification. This work solidifies our understanding of water uptake and chemical reactions in mixed organic-inorganic atmospheric aerosols by uncovering multistep water uptake dynamics and new phase formation.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Engineering study proposing a zeolite adsorption/desorption thermal energy storage system to convert industrial low-grade waste heat into data center cooling, reducing electricity use substantially while modestly increasing net water consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Data centers (DCs) represent a rapidly growing segment of electricity demand, with a substantial share of their consumption attributed to cooling needs. We propose a zeolite-based thermal energy storage (TES) system that harnesses low-grade waste heat (&lt;200 °C) from nearby industrial facilities to provide cooling for DCs. The system operates through spatially and temporally decoupled adsorption (discharging) and desorption (charging) steps: (a) industrial waste heat drives zeolite desorption, and (b) DC heat rejection facilitates water evaporation, enabling zeolite adsorption. Computational modeling of the thermodynamic cycle quantifies the electricity and water implications of the concept, showing (a) electricity savings exceeding 75% for the combined DC + industrial facility (~86% for the DC alone) relative to a benchmark configuration using a compression chiller and cooling tower, and (b) a modest increase in water consumption for the combined facility (14.8 – 23.9%), despite a reduction of 76.5 – 90.1% % in the industrial facility’s standalone water use. Geospatial analysis of existing DC and industrial facility locations shows that the two are typically in close proximity (median distance of 57 km). As a result, even when transportation energy requirements are considered, via an electrified truck, system-wide electricity savings could be notable in many scenarios (as high +45%). We discuss engineering design considerations, alternative deployment configurations, as well as geographic and coordination requirements for their widespread adoption.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Demonstrates native charge detection mass spectrometry for accurate intact mass/charge profiling of kilobase-scale mRNAs and their impurities, advancing analytical capabilities for large RNA molecules but with only indirect relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) enables direct measurement of mass and charge for individual ions and overcomes fundamental limitations of conventional electrospray mass spectrometry for large, heterogeneous biomolecules. Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) represent a particularly challenging analytical target, as transcripts often span thousands of nucleotides, exhibit substantial heterogeneity, and form higher-order oligomers that are difficult to assess using existing workflows. Here, we optimize and evaluate native CDMS for intact analysis of long mRNAs and conduct systematic comparison of positive and negative analysis polarities. Using a panel of commercially available mRNAs ranging from approximately 1,000 to 4,500 nucleotides, we demonstrate that native CDMS enables direct, and accurate mass measurement of intact mRNAs alongside various process-related impurities (truncations, dimers etc.). Collisional activation improves mass accuracy by reducing adduct heterogeneity while preserving the ability to resolve impurity populations. Across all constructs, CDMS provides quantitative access to charge distributions that scale with transcript length and respond predictably to activation, denaturation, and polarity, offering insight into ion charging behavior and charge accommodation for large RNAs. Negative polarity measurements generally access higher charge states than positive polarity, particularly for the largest transcripts, improving sensitivity and relative size discrimination, while intact mass accuracy remains comparable between polarities when appropriate ion transmission strategies are employed. Together, these results establish native CDMS as a versatile and information-rich platform for intact mRNA characterization, providing simultaneous access to mass, charge, and impurity information that complements existing analytical methods and supports emerging needs in RNA biotherapeutic development.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Germline development relies on perinuclear membraneless germ granules, yet the mechanisms underlying their assembly remain poorly understood. Here we uncover a conserved and central role for LOTUS-domain proteins in driving germ granule assembly. In C. elegans, the LOTUS-domain protein EGGD-1/MIP-1 at sub-stoichiometric levels recruits Vasa protein GLH-1 to the nuclear periphery. Acting as a catalyst, EGGD-1 modulates the ATPase cycle of GLH-1 by preferentially binding to its open conformation, enhancing its RNA binding activities, and facilitating its transition to the closed conformation. In this closed state, GLH-1 enriches mRNAs at the nuclear periphery, which enables the accumulation of RNA-binding proteins including PGL-1 and PGL-3. Using human cells, we demonstrate the LOTUS-domain protein TDRD5 similarly recruits DDX4, the human Vasa homolog, and stimulates the formation of intermitochondrial cement. Collectively, our findings reveal an evolutionarily conserved role of LOTUS-domain proteins in enhancing Vasa activity and provide a unified model for germ granule assembly across species.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Evolution over deep time is often slow relative to neutral or directional expectations. A striking example is provided by Drosophila wing shape, which shows substantial genetic variance yet comparatively little macroevolutionary change. Using a large-scale fitness assay, we find pervasive stabilizing selection across dimensions of D. melanogaster wing shape that is proportional to standing variation, driven by variance in male fitness, and likely generated by pleiotropy. Parameterizing a macroevolutionary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model using our selection estimate recapitulates observed among species variance under reasonable effective population sizes, suggesting a role for apparent stabilizing selection in constraining wing shape evolution over deep time.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Machine-learning architecture for predicting Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction yields with uncertainty calibration and attention-based interpretability, but it has no direct connection to origins-of-life chemistry or astrobiology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Accurate prediction of chemical reaction yields remains essential for accelerating synthesis optimization, yet current machine learning models face critical limitations in capturing temporal dynamics, providing calibrated uncertainty estimates, and explicitly modeling reactant-to-product transformations. Here we introduce ReactionForge, a novel Temporal Graph Network architecture specifically designed for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling yield prediction that addresses these challenges through five key innovations. First, we implement persistent temporal memory mechanisms using Gated Recurrent Units to track catalyst evolution and reagent dynamics across reaction sequences. Second, we develop cross-attention layers that explicitly compare reactant and product molecular graphs, learning which structural changes most influence reaction outcomes. Third, we incorporate hierarchical graph pooling via Self-Attention Graph Pooling to automatically discover functional group patterns. Fourth, we employ evidential deep learning to provide calibrated epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in a single forward pass. Fifth, we use multi-task learning with yield, selectivity, and reaction time as joint objectives to improve generalization. Evaluated on 5,760 Suzuki-Miyaura reactions spanning five metal catalysts and diverse substrates, ReactionForge achieves R² = 0.968 ± 0.004 (RMSE = 5.12 ± 0.18%, MAE = 3.89 ± 0.12%), representing statistically significant improvements over YieldGNN (R² = 0.957 ± 0.005, paired t-test p = 0.002) and YieldBERT (R² = 0.810 ± 0.010, p &lt; 0.001). The model provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates (Expected Calibration Error = 0.031) that enable uncertainty-guided active learning, achieving 37% improved data efficiency over random sampling. Systematic ablation studies reveal that each architectural component contributes measurably to performance, with cross-attention and temporal memory each adding approximately ΔR² = 0.005. Interpretability analysis shows that learned attention weights successfully recover known structure-reactivity relationships, including chloride activation challenges and ligand-substrate compatibility patterns. Despite architectural complexity, ReactionForge trains 28% faster than YieldGNN. This work demonstrates that chemically motivated architectural innovations in graph neural networks can meaningfully advance reaction prediction when properly grounded in mechanistic understanding.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Hydrogen is a primordial energy carrier and industrial raw material that will play a crucial role in future energy transition and de-fossilization ambitions. Silane hydrolysis represents an underexplored approach to hydrogen generation, yet most known systems have thus far focused on noble-metal catalysis. Herein we report a highly active transition metal-free method for the production of hydrogen from (sea)water and hydrosilanes, relying on the unique combination of simple bases as catalyst, and dimethyl sulfoxide as promoting solvent, assisted by mechanistic and computational studies. Remarkably, the hydrolysis of phenylsilane achieved a turnover frequency (TOF) of 5116 min–1, far superior to existing metal-free systems (TOF ≤ 8 min–1), and even surpassing noble-metal catalysts (TOF ≤ 170 min–1). The developed method rapidly generates hydrogen directly from seawater, applying polymethylhydrosilane (PMHS), a silicon industry waste, with rates up to 70.2 molH2/gcat/h. Notably, we have demonstrated the recyclability of the solvent, and re-use of the by-products formed during PMHS hydrolysis. Thus, the polysiloxane by-products were efficiently depolymerized into functional chlorosilane monomers, which are suitable for the design of new high-value silicon polymers. These findings highlight the broader applicability and circularity of our integrated approach.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a tunable bioorthogonal proximity-labeling method on live cell surfaces via photocatalytic/enzatic tetrazine activation and s-TCO quenching control, primarily advancing chemical biology rather than origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Described is the use of photocatalytic and enzymatic activation of rapid bioorthogonal chemistry for cell surface proximity labeling. Current approaches to proximity labeling rely on the activation of reactive intermediates (e.g. carbenes, nitrenes, radicals, electrophiles) whose half-life is regulated by uncontrollable quenching by water and native biomolecules in the cell or media. Here, we describe an alternative proximity labeling approach based on the fastest variant of the bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation (k2 107 M–1s–1), where reaction half-life can be tuned by simply controlling the concentration of a strained trans-cyclooctene (s-TCO) quencher. An electrophilic s-TCO-NHS ester is initially used to pan-label the proteome prior to activation, providing a bioorthogonal handle for tagging proteins. Subsequently, antibody-photocatalyst or antibody-enzyme conjugates are targeted to CD45 on the surface of live cells and used to locally catalyze the conversion of dihydrotetrazine molecules to reactive tetrazines. Photocatalysis is achieved through brief, 20-second irradiation at 470 nm with a commercially available antibody-fluorescein conjugate, and enzymatic catalysis is achieved using a commercially available HRP-antibody conjugate. Freely diffusing s-TCO-CO2H serves as a quencher during the proximity labeling reaction, and adjusting the quencher concentration can attenuate labeling as demonstrated in vitro on a model protein. Tuning the half-life of the proximity labeling reaction was also studied in live cells and found to produce proteomic data sets with high overlap. Labeling reactions with shorter half-lives enriched fewer total proteins but maintained enrichment of known interactors. We anticipate that the use of bioorthogonal reactions to facilitate protein proximity labeling will find broad use for studying protein-protein interactions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> RNA molecules fold into complex three-dimensional structures that determine their function. A wide range of mathematical frameworks, such as chord diagrams, fatgraphs, and context-free grammars, have been used to represent these structures; however, these models have largely been developed from mathematical motivations rather than from considerations of the physical principles that govern the folding, organization, and interactions of RNA molecules. In this perspective review, we reinterpret these mathematical models through the lens of circuit topology (CT), a physics-inspired approach originally developed to characterize interaction patterns in linear polymers, relate them to folding kinetics, and enable molecular design and engineering. Using CT, RNA secondary structures, including pseudoknots, can be represented compactly, revealing direct mapping between traditional RNA models and the underlying topological arrangement of interactions. This unified view highlights shared structural principles between RNA and other polymer systems and provides a common basis for exchanging methods across different areas of molecular science. Finally, we outline how the CT framework can be extended to analyze higher-order motifs such as RNA-RNA interactions, base triples, and aspects of folding kinetics. By providing a common language for analyzing the organization and function of folded biomolecular chains, CT bridges mathematical abstraction and molecular reality.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Although our synthetic efforts were directed toward cordysinin A, the reported natural product, the route ultimately delivered its diastereomer, (5S)-hydroxy-cyclo (L-Pro-L-Leu), whose total synthesis is described herein. The cyclo (L-proline-L-leucine) 2,5-diketopiperazine scaffold was prepared through standard solution-phase peptide coupling, followed by deprotection and intramolecular cyclization. Electrochemical oxidation at the proline C5 position generated an N-acyl iminium intermediate that was efficiently trapped by water to afford the corresponding 5-hydroxyproline derivative. However, detailed spectroscopic characterization of the synthetic product, together with comparison to the reported data for the natural isolate, revealed notable discrepancies, suggesting that the structure originally assigned to cordysinin A was likely incorrect. Our findings instead support a structural revision of cordysinin A to a regioisomer featuring hydroxylation at the proline C4 position rather than C5.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a photonic–electro–ionic “optical fiber membrane electrode” catalytic platform that co-localizes photons, electrons, and ions to boost multi-field catalysis (including water-splitting), with potential indirect relevance for prebiotic/Origins-of-Life reaction engineering but no direct OoL focus.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper introduces Optical Fiber Chemistry (OFC) as a fourth-generation catalytic paradigm, distinguished not by incremental improvements in catalyst materials but by a fundamental reconfiguration of the catalytic reaction platform. By employing optical fibers as active photonic control elements, OFC achieves gen- uine coplanar coupling of photons, electrons, and ions within a single membrane electrode, thereby overcoming the intrinsic spatial separation that limits conven- tional thermal catalysis, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and photoelectrochemical systems. This architecture establishes an essential physical foundation for pro- grammable chemistry and artificial intelligence–driven chemical systems. Optical Fiber Chemical Catalysis (OFC) represents the most substantial ad- vance in photo–electro and multi-field synergistic catalysis since the seminal demon- stration of photoelectrochemical water splitting by Fujishima and Honda in 1972. Here, we define the concepts of optical fiber chemistry and optical fiber chemi- cal catalysis, delineate their fundamental elements, and formulate the underlying catalytic laws. The OFC framework enables economical, safe, efficient, and high– energy-density scale-up or distributed deployment of optical fiber chemical reaction units, forming modular optical fiber chemical stacks. Moreover, the OFC platform allows chemical reaction processes to be programmably regulated and serves as a core chemical platform for artificial intelligence laboratories and intelligent chemical manufacturing. Catalytic principle: The central feature of OFC is a sandwich-structured optical-fiber membrane electrode, in which rational structural design enables the synergistic coupling of optical fields, electric fields, and proton/ion transport path- ways at a single reaction interface. Within this architecture, photons, electrons, protons, ions, catalysts, reactants, and products coexist at the same interface, allowing photonic excitation and charge separation to occur synchronously and thereby markedly enhancing catalytic efficiency. On the basis of these principles, optical fiber chemical catalysis is expected to enable key reactions—including am- monia synthesis, noble-metal-free fuel cells, organic synthesis, and pharmaceutical manufacturing—under ambient temperature and pressure. Over the next decade, OFC is anticipated to emerge as a major technological route in chemical engineering and catalysis.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding the role of intrinsic magnetic order on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires careful consideration of the magnetic properties of both the catalytic surface and bulk under operating conditions. Because these often diverge from those of the pristine material, operando characterization that directly links magnetic behaviour to catalytic activity is essential. Here, we investigate the magnetic properties of La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 thin‐film OER catalysts using a combination of temperature‐dependent operando ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy (FMR), ambient‐pressure X‐ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), and operando X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). A direct correlation between changes in long‐range magnetic order and OER activity, with minimal changes in the catalyst’s electronic state was observed. Non‐interacting ferromagnetic regions were found to enhance activity at temperatures just above the Curie temperature. The enhancement is further amplified when the thin film undergoes the bulk paramagnetic‐to‐ferromagnetic transition below the Curie temperature. Our results indicate that interatomic spin‐exchange interactions, occurring within ferromagnetic regions and across the ferromagnetic bulk, and between these atoms and adsorbates, dominate the observed OER enhancements, potentially augmented by short‐range spin‐polarized conduction effects. These findings highlight that local ferromagnetic order, governed by exchange interactions over a few unit cells, plays a crucial role in modulating surface reaction dynamics, offering mechanistic insight into spin‐dependent catalysis.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Described is the use of photocatalytic and enzymatic activation of rapid bioorthogonal chemistry for cell surface proximity labeling. Current approaches to proximity labeling rely on the activation of reactive intermediates (e.g. carbenes, nitrenes, radicals, electrophiles) whose half-life is regulated by uncontrollable quenching by water and native biomolecules in the cell or media.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Develops an individual-based evolutionary model showing how vector-mediated transmission and forest management thresholds can maintain or suppress high virulence in pine wilt disease, but it is not directly related to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pathogen virulence is a central trait shaping disease dynamics and management outcomes. Classical evolutionary theory predicts that virulence should be constrained by trade-offs between transmission and host survival, often favoring intermediate optima. However, many vector-borne forest diseases exhibit persistently high virulence despite severe host mortality, challenging this expectation. Increasing evidence suggests that ecological context, particularly transmission mode, vector abundance, and spatial structure, can fundamentally reshape virulence-transmission trade-offs, biasing selection toward elevated virulence rather than attenuation. Pine wilt disease, caused by the pine wood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and transmitted by Monochamus beetles, exemplifies this paradox. Infection leads to rapid host death, yet highly virulent nematode lineages persist and spread across forest landscapes. In this system, host death directly facilitates vector reproduction by creating suitable breeding substrates, potentially reversing the classical trade-off in which host mortality constrains transmission. Why such systems remain evolutionarily trapped in high-virulence states, despite widespread host depletion, remains unresolved. Using pine wilt disease as a motivating and representative vector-borne forest pathosystem, we develop an individual-based evolutionary framework to investigate how transmission conditions and management interventions shape long-term virulence evolution. By integrating stochastic population dynamics with selection-gradient analysis, we identify the mechanisms sustaining high virulence and determine quantitative management thresholds capable of reversing selection pressures and driving durable virulence suppression.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Single-molecule tracking in living cells shows that short transcription-factor activation domains (not just DNA-binding domains) largely determine chromatin-bound fraction and residence time via coactivator interactions (e.g., p300), informing how eukaryotic gene-regulatory machinery can evolve modular control over DNA occupancy.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Transcription factors regulate gene expression with DNA-binding domains (DBDs) and activation domains. Despite evidence to the contrary, DBDs are often assumed to be the primary mediators of transcription factor (TF) interactions with DNA and chromatin. Here, we used fast single-molecule tracking of transcription factors in living cells to show that short activation domains can control the fraction of molecules bound to chromatin. Stronger activation domains have higher bound fractions and longer residence times on chromatin. Furthermore, mutations that increase activation domain strength also increase chromatin binding. This trend was consistent in four different activation domains and their mutants. This effect further held for activation domains appended to three different structural classes of DBDs. Stronger activation domains with high chromatin-bound fractions also exhibited increased binding to the p300 coactivator in proximity-assisted photoactivation experiments. Genome-wide measurements indicate these activation domains primarily control the occupancy of binding rather than the genomic location. Taken together, these results demonstrate that very short activation domains play a major role in tethering transcription factors to chromatin.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Bonobos (Pan paniscus), an endangered species, have for decades been genetically understudied, partly due to difficulties in obtaining high-quality samples. The study of their genome is important not only for understanding their evolution, but also for improving conservation efforts, including population management, diversity and inbreeding assessment, and tracking rescued individuals to combat illegal wildlife trafficking. Here, we use chromosome 21 target capture data from 156 non-invasively collected faecal samples from wild bonobos to perform a comprehensive analysis of their population structure. We confirm the existence of three previously suggested subpopulations identified here as Western, Central and Eastern bonobos which are defined by natural barriers of gene flow such as the Lomami River. By estimating levels of inbreeding, diversity and differentiation, we find support for isolation of mainly Western and Eastern populations and add information on the dispersal routes of their ancestors. We infer split times and separation of these populations and apply a genetic framework to geolocalize samples of unknown origin, showing that locations of their potential origin can be estimated with a precision of up to a median of ~50 km. Our study provides valuable insight into the evolution and population structure of bonobos and reveals how rivers act as strong barriers between populations. It also offers resources for conservation efforts and highlights the need to monitor bonobo populations more closely, in particular isolated ones.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> DNA-functionalized nanoparticles noncovalently recruit diverse enzymes and boost activity in a sequence-dependent, programmable manner, offering a nucleic-acid–based interface conceptually relevant to how biopolymer surfaces can modulate catalysis but not directly addressing prebiotic origins.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Enhancing enzyme performance without protein engineering remains a central challenge in biocatalysis. Here, we report the unusual discovery that nanoparticles densely functionalized with DNA can bind enzymes without chemical conjugation, affinity tags, or engineered recognition motifs, and substantially increase catalytic activity. This effect generalizes across multiple enzyme classes: cytochrome c and catalase exhibit ~9.4-fold and ~3.0-fold higher peroxidase activity, while carbonic anhydrase shows a ~1.6-fold increased esterase activity, underscoring the versatility of this system. Mechanistic studies indicate that enhancement is an emergent property of the three-dimensional, high-density DNA shell, with the core functioning primarily as a scaffold. Activity modulation is governed not only by DNA density and length, but also, critically, by DNA sequence, establishing sequence design as a programmable handle for tuning enzyme output. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations reveal that base-specific interactions reshape enzyme conformational flexibility and increase active-site accessibility. We further show sequence-encoded control in multienzyme systems through a DNA-programmed cascade where DNA-functionalized glucose oxidase recruits cytochrome c at the DNA interface, yielding &gt;4.8-fold higher cascade efficiency than free-enzyme mixtures. Together, these findings position DNA-functionalized nanoparticles as adaptable, sequence-programmable platforms for improving and coordinating biocatalysis, opening new routes for enzyme control in synthesis, diagnostics, and therapeutic design.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Amino acids and peptides are essential molecules that play pivotal roles in biology, medicine, and chemistry, particularly in drug design and discovery. Peptide-based drugs are increasingly favored due to their high solubility in aqueous biological systems, ease of structural modification, and the non-toxic nature of their metabolites. For most peptide drugs, the chirality of their higher structures determines both their functionality and biological activities. To date, nearly all amino acid residues in peptide structures exhibit central chirality, although axial chirality has occasionally been observed in peptides. In this study, we report the discovery of a new form of chirality, termed turbo chirality, which consists of two propeller blades and coexists alongside central chirality in amino acids and peptides. Specifically, we found that di-propeller structures in amino acids and peptides can exist in either M,M- or P,P-configurations, depending on the orientation of their chiral centers, which are controlled by (S)- and (R)-configurations, respectively. Computational studies were conducted to explore the relative energies of rotational barriers for conversion between M,M- and P,P-configurations, as well as the transition pathways between the two enantiomers, yielding results that align with our expectations. This discovery is expected to have broad implications for amino acid and peptide research, particularly in structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of peptides and peptidomimetics. As a result, our findings are anticipated to make a significant impact across multiple disciplines, including chemistry, biomedicine, and materials science.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a machine-learning/physics hybrid method to efficiently simulate environment-influenced optical spectra of solvated chromophores (demonstrated in water and methanol), with limited direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Simulations of optical spectra can provide key insights to aid experimental interpretation of electronic excitation phenomena. For chromophores in the condensed phase, these spectra, which incorporate the coupling between electronic excitation and molecular and solvent nuclear motions, can be simulated using excitation energies obtained from molecular dynamics simulations of the chromophore and solvent. Here, we present a hybrid scheme that exploits machine learning and physically informed spectral densities to show that as few as 25 ground and excited state energetic gradient calculations can be used to construct models that accurately predict environment-influenced vibronic coupling in optical spectra. We demonstrate our approach for the green fluorescent protein chromophore in water and the cresyl violet chromophore in methanol. We show that our hybrid approach, employing a machine learning model for the high-frequency spectral density and an ab initio parameterized Debye spectral density for the low-frequency, results in systematic improvement of the optical absorption lineshape, leading to a simple machine learning scheme that can be used for simulation of spectral densities and optical spectra.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> DNA is under constant attack by exogenous and endogenous agents that result in alkylation damage, which can lead to mutagenesis and cell death. 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II (AlkA) initiates the repair of many alkylated nucleotides in bacterial cells by cleaving the glycosidic bond connecting the damaged nucleobase to deoxyribose. However, due to the lack of a crystal structure for the enzyme with a substrate nucleotide bound in the active site, it is poorly understood how AlkA accommodates such a wide variety of substrates and there is controversy regarding the AlkA catalytic mechanism. The present study uses MD simulations to investigate AlkA interactions with DNA containing a major substrate, 3-methyladenine (3mA), and QM/MM calculations to map multiple potential pathways for 3mA excision. MD simulations reveal eight residues comprise the AlkA active site, binding the substrate through several non-specific, hydrophobic contacts. Substrate promiscuity is uncovered as likely to be further promoted by Y273, which can change conformation to modulate the binding pocket size. Despite a previous proposal that AlkA actvitity involves DNA−protein crosslink formation, QM/MM calculations suggest that catalysis proceeds through a direct hydrolysis mechanism in which D238 activates a water nucleophile that attacks at C1′ of the damaged nucleotide. Our combined MD and QM/MM approach highlights that proper D238 positioning with respect to the substrate is supported by a network of D238 interactions with the substrate, W218, and W272. The proposed mechanism is consistent with experimental kinetic, mutagenic, and structural data for AlkA, and aligns with the preferred pathway of many other monofunctional glycosylases. The insights into AlkA substrate binding and catalysis gained from this study can push forward the design of small molecule inhibitors as antibacterial agents and broaden our general understanding of DNA repair pathways, which can aid in the development of cancer therapeutics.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05095v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, affects over 50 million people worldwide, and poses significant risks, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Conventional unimodal approaches, primarily reliant on electroencephalography (EEG), face several key challenges, including low SNR, nonstationarity, inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity, portability, and real-time applicability in clinical settings. To address these issues, a comprehensive survey highlights the concept of advanced multimodal learning for epileptic seizure detection and prediction (AMLSDP). The survey presents the evolution of epileptic seizure detection (ESD) and prediction (ESP) technologies across different eras. The survey also explores the core challenges of multimodal and non-EEG-based ESD and ESP. To overcome the key challenges of the multimodal system, the survey introduces the advanced processing strategies for efficient AMLSDP. Furthermore, this survey highlights future directions for researchers and practitioners. We believe this work will advance neurotechnology toward wearable and imaging-based solutions for epilepsy monitoring, serving as a valuable resource for future innovations in this domain.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05177v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We explore the limitations of using imbalance dynamics as a diagnostic tool for many-body localization (MBL) and show that spatial averaging can mask important microscopic features. Focusing on the strongly disordered regime of the random-field XXZ chain, we use state-of-the-art numerical techniques (Krylov time evolution and full diagonalization) to demonstrate that site-resolved spin autocorrelators reveal a rich and complex dynamical behavior that is obscured by the imbalance observable. By analyzing the time evolution and infinite-time limits of these local probes, we reveal resonant structures and rare local instabilities within the MBL phase. These numerical findings are supported by an analytical, few-site toy model that captures the emergence of a multiple-peak structure in local magnetization histograms, which is a hallmark of local resonances. These few-body local effects provide a more detailed understanding of ergodicity-breaking dynamics, and also allow us to explain the finite-size effects of long-time imbalance, and its sensitivity to the initial conditions in quench protocols. Overall, our experimentally testable predictions highlight the necessity of a refined, site-resolved approach to fully understand the complexities of MBL and its connection to rare-region effects.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2510.06154v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The formation of gullies on Mars has often been attributed to the melting of (sub)surface water ice. However, melting-based hypotheses generally overlook key processes: (1) sublimation cooling by latent heat absorption, (2) the non-stability of ice where melting conditions can be reached, and (3) the particular microclimates of gullied slopes. Using state-of-the-art climate simulations, we reassess ice melting scenarios over the past four million years (obliquity &lt;= 35{\deg}), beyond the estimated period of gully formation. We find that the melting of opaque water snow or ice at the surface of Mars is unlikely anywhere due to sublimation cooling, while (quasi-) stable subsurface ice is typically too deep to reach melting temperatures. We propose an alternative mechanism in which seasonal CO2 frost sublimation destabilizes the regolith and brings the underlying water ice close to the surface, allowing rapid heating. Even under these optimal conditions, melting requires unrealistic assumptions. Ice containing a small amount of dust could melt via a solid-state greenhouse effect, but both its possibility and frequency in Mars&#x27; recent past remain uncertain.</p>

This mapping, which holds at all times, allows us to recast transitions in the population genome distribution as dynamical phase transitions, which can then be studied using the toolbox of large-deviation theory.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Tests whether CO2-rich Martian-like atmospheres can replace argon as shielding gas for selective laser melting of 316L steel, supporting in-situ manufacturing on Mars but offering only tangential relevance to origins-of-life astrobiology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04232v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: In-space manufacturing is essential for achieving long-term planetary colonization, particularly on Mars, where material transport from Earth is both costly and logistically restrictive. Traditional subtractive manufacturing methods are highly equipment-, energy-, and material-intensive, making additive manufacturing (AM) a more practical and sustainable alternative for extraterrestrial production. Among various AM technologies, selective laser melting (SLM) stands out due to its exceptional versatility, precision, and capability to produce dense metallic parts with complex geometries. However, conventional SLM processes rely heavily on inert argon environments to prevent oxidation and ensure high-quality part formation, conditions that are difficult to reproduce on Mars. This study investigates the feasibility of using carbon dioxide (CO2), which makes up over 95% of the Martian atmosphere, as a potential substitute for argon in SLM. Single-track and two-dimensional 316L stainless steel specimens were fabricated under argon, CO2, and ambient air environments with a wide range of laser parameters to evaluate the influence of atmospheric composition on surface morphology, microstructural cohesion, and oxidation behavior. The results reveal that no single parameter controls the overall part quality; rather, a balance of parameters is essential to maintain thermal equilibrium during fabrication. Although parts produced in CO2 exhibited slightly inferior surface finish, cohesion, and oxidation resistance compared to argon, they performed significantly better than those fabricated in ambient air. These findings suggest that CO2-assisted SLM could enable sustainable in situ manufacturing on Mars and may also serve as a cost-effective alternative shielding gas for terrestrial applications.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04593v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation is a driving source of photochemistry in planetary atmospheres. Proper interpretation of atmospheric observations requires a full understanding of the radiation environment that a planet is exposed to. Using the Suborbital Imaging Spectrograph for Transition-region Irradiance from Nearby Exoplanet host stars (SISTINE) rocket-borne spectrograph, we observed the Sun-like binary system $\alpha$ Centauri AB and captured the FUV spectrum of both stars simultaneously. Our spectra cover 980--1570 {\AA}, providing the broadest FUV wavelength coverage taken in a single exposure and spanning several key stellar emission features which are important photochemical drivers. Combining the SISTINE spectrum with archival observations, model spectra, and a novel stellar activity model, we have created spectral energy distributions (SEDs) spanning 5 {\AA}--1 mm for both $\alpha$ Centauri A and B. We use the SEDs to estimate the total high-energy flux (X-ray--UV) incident on a hypothetical exoplanet orbiting $\alpha$ Centauri A. Because the incident flux varies over time due to the orbit of the stellar companion and the activity level of each star, we use the VULCAN photochemical kinetics code to estimate atmospheric chemical abundances in the case of minimum and maximum flux exposure. Our results indicate that enhanced atmospheric mass loss due to stellar binarity will likely not be an issue for future exoplanet-hunting missions such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory when searching for Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.01474v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The interactions between stars and their orbiting planets, driven by forces such as stellar radiation and gravity, play an essential role in shaping exoplanetary atmospheres and gas-rich debris discs. One way to look into the composition of these environments is to observe how they can contaminate the stellar photospheres. For that, we examine how stellar radiation pressure and gravity influence atomic species and analyse their effects across various stellar effective temperatures. Using the radiative-to-gravitational force ratio, we determined the atomic movement direction and assessed the velocity boost imparted to neutral atoms escaping from exoplanet atmospheres or debris discs. Incorporating the solar far ultraviolet/extreme ultraviolet spectrum to address flux discrepancies in the {\sc{atlas9}} model, we find that radiation affects atoms differently according to their ionisation state, with highly ionised species less affected by stellar radiation. Our results conclude that the stars most suitable for observing stellar contamination are those between 6,500 and 8,000 K, with neutral noble gases and ionised iron-peak elements as the most likely contaminants.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04746v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We study the mass-conserved reaction-diffusion system known as the wave-pinning model, which serves as a minimal framework for describing cell polarity. In this model, the interplay between reaction kinetics and slow diffusion forms a sharp interface that partitions the domain into high- and low-concentration regions. We perform a detailed asymptotic analysis and derive higher-order approximation equations governing the motion of this interface. Our results show that on a fast timescale, the interface evolves via propagating front dynamics, whereas on a slow timescale, it evolves as an area-preserving mean curvature flow. Furthermore, using the derived free boundary problem, we demonstrate that on a significantly slower timescale, an interface whose endpoints lie on the domain boundary drifts along the boundary toward regions of higher curvature. In summary, our analysis reveals that the interface dynamics in the wave-pinning model exhibit a hierarchy of three distinct timescales: wave propagation on a fast timescale, curvature-driven area-preserving evolution on a slow timescale, and motion along the boundary on a significantly slower timescale.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.17976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Stars and planets form, live, and evolve in unison. Throughout the life of a star, dusty circumstellar discs and stellar outflows influence the further evolution of both the star(s) and their orbiting planet(s). Planet-forming discs, winds of red giant branch (RGB) or asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and post-RGB/post-AGB discs are examples of such host environments where dust physics plays a key role. The physical processes that occur during each of these stages establishes how the Solar System as well as exoplanetary systems were formed, are evolving, and will eventually die. This White Paper aims to bridge the fields of stellar evolution and planet formation by peering into the dust kinematics and macrostructure formation, and its effect on planet-host interaction, in dusty environments from stellar birth to death. Near-future advancements in the 2030s will enable the detection, orbital monitoring and atmospheric/mineralogical characterisation of close-in (proto)planets across diverse stages of stellar evolution. To take full advantage of these developments by the 2040s, we should develop the capabilities required to image the varied dusty environments in which planets are entrained over their lifetime. This will enable extensive testing of current theoretical understandings - from the micro-scales of dust assembly to the deeply interlinked macro-scales of planet-host interactions - across diverse settings often too small, distant, and faint to be resolved in the next decade, simultaneously providing valuable constraints on the two-way interplay of dusty host environments and planetary formation/evolution.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05092v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This paper bridges this critical gap by providing a systematic examination of the beamforming codebook technology, i.e., precoding matrix indicator (PMI), in the 5G NR from theoretical, standardization, and implementation perspectives. We begin by introducing the background of beamforming in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and the signaling procedures for codebook-based beamforming in practical 5G systems. Then, we establish the fundamentals of regular codebooks and port-selection codebooks in 3GPP standards. Next, we provide rigorous technical analysis of 3GPP codebook evolution spanning Releases 15-18, with particular focus on: 1) We elucidate the core principles underlying codebook design, 2) provide clear physical interpretations for each symbolic variable in the codebook formulas, summarized in tabular form, and 3) offer intuitive visual illustrations to explain how codebook parameters convey information. These essential pedagogical elements are almost entirely absent in the often-obscure standardization documents. Through mathematical modeling, performance benchmarking, feedback comparisons, and scenario-dependent applicability analysis, we provide researchers and engineers with a unified understanding of beamforming codebooks in real-world systems. Furthermore, we identify future directions and other beamforming scenarios for ongoing research and development efforts. This work serves as both an informative tutorial and a guidance for future research, facilitating more effective collaboration between academia and industry in advancing wireless communication technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04484v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We present a detailed transit photometric analysis of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-12 b using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The study is based on publicly available calibrated light curves and target pixel files accessed through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) cloud infrastructure. After extracting and normalizing the photometric time series, the light curve was phase-folded using an initial ephemeris and modeled with a physical transit model to determine the system&#x27;s geometric parameters. From the transit modeling, we measure the planet-to-star radius ratio, orbital inclination, impact parameter, and transit duration. Adopting stellar parameters from the literature, we derive the planetary radius and transit depth, confirming the highly inflated nature of WASP-12 b. Individual mid-transit times were measured and used to refine the orbital ephemeris through a weighted linear fit. The resulting refined orbital period and reference epoch improve the predictive accuracy of future transit times over the TESS observational baseline. An observed-minus-calculated (O-C) analysis reveals no statistically significant transit timing variations, indicating that the timing data are consistent with a linear ephemeris within the measurement uncertainties. This work demonstrates the capability of TESS photometry to provide precise transit characterization and ephemeris refinement for well-studied exoplanet systems, and provides updated parameters that are relevant for future atmospheric and dynamical investigations of WASP-12 b.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2402.06677v5 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Quantum entanglement manifests itself in non-local correlations between the constituents of a system. In its simplest realization, a measurement on one subsystem is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple parties, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we argue that all forms of multipartite entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a physical state as it heats up, evolves in time in a large family of dynamical protocols, or as its parts become separated. We focus on the generic case where the system interacts with an environment. These results mainly follow from the geometry of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium, and a quantum spin chain. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that protects bipartite quantum correlations. However, genuinely collective fermionic entanglement disappears during typical evolution, thus sharing the same fate as in bosonic systems. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04315v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: At high eccentricities, tidal forcing excites vibrational modes within orbiting bodies known as dynamical tides. In this paper, we implement the coupled evolution of these modes with the body&#x27;s orbit in the \texttt{REBOUNDx} framework, an extension to the popular $N$-body integrator \texttt{REBOUND}. We provide a variety of test cases relevant to exoplanet dynamics and demonstrate overall agreement with prior studies of dynamical tides in the secular regime. Our implementation is readily applied to various high-eccentricity scenarios and allows for fast and accurate $N$-body investigations of astrophysical systems for which dynamical tides are relevant.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04433v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The integration of multicarrier modulation and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) is critical for reliable transmission of wireless signals in complex environments, which significantly improve spectrum efficiency. Existing studies have shown that popular orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) offer significant advantages over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in uncoded doubly selective channels. However, it remains uncertain whether these benefits extend to coded systems. Meanwhile, the information-theoretic limit analysis of coded MIMO multicarrier systems and the corresponding low-complexity receiver design remain unclear. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-slot cross-domain memory approximate message passing (MS-CD-MAMP) receiver as well as develops its information-theoretic (i.e., achievable rate) limit and optimal coding principle for MIMO-multicarrier modulation (e.g., OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM) systems. The proposed MS-CD-MAMP receiver can exploit not only the time domain channel sparsity for low complexity but also the corresponding symbol domain constellation constraints for performance enhancement. Meanwhile, limited by the high-dimensional complex state evolution (SE), a simplified single-input single-output variational SE is proposed to derive the achievable rate of MS-CD-MAMP and the optimal coding principle with the goal of maximizing the achievable rate. Numerical results show that coded MIMO-OFDM/OTFS/AFDM with MS-CD-MAMP achieve the same maximum achievable rate in doubly selective channels, whose finite-length performance with practical optimized low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is only 0.5 $\sim$ 1.8 dB away from the associated theoretical limit, and has 0.8 $\sim$ 4.4 dB gain over the well-designed point-to-point LDPC codes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.07220v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Recent progress in open many-body quantum systems has highlighted the importance of the Markov length, the characteristic scale over which conditional correlations decay. It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany-Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04874v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: A highly diluted aqueous solution of histamine was studied by molecular dynamics using the TIP3P and SPC/E water models. It was shown that the local structure of the solution around histamine is determined by local Coulomb interactions and hydrogen bonds and is practically independent of the choice of the water model. Dynamic analysis based on the mean square displacement functions revealed a significant dependence of the diffusion behavior of histamine on the water model. It was found that the TIP3P water model leads to overestimated values of the diffusion coefficients of water and histamine and a transition to the diffusion mode of motion. It was found that the SPC/E water model provides slower dynamics of the solution components, and the values of the diffusion coefficients are in better agreement with experimental data. It was shown that the dynamics of histamine is highly sensitive to the choice of the water model, and the SPC/E model is more suitable for the correct description of the dynamic properties of the ``histamine--water&#x27;&#x27; system under physiological conditions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a two-parameter memory-weighted velocity (fractional-derivative-like) operator for history-dependent dynamical systems, with no direct connection to origins-of-life chemistry or biology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05122v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The modeling of dynamical systems whose present state depends on their history often requires generalizations of the classical concept of a derivative. This work introduces a **memory-weighted velocity operator** \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}\) designed to quantify rates of change while incorporating time-varying, power-law memory. The operator is defined via a kernel with two independent, continuous memory exponents \(\alpha(t)\) and \(\beta(t)\), which separately weight the influence of past state increments and the scaling of elapsed time. For a function \(x\), the resulting quantity \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}[x]\) represents its memory-weighted rate of change. We establish fundamental properties of this operator, including its explicit integral representation, linearity, and a key result on the **continuous dependence** of \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}[x]\) on the exponents \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) with respect to uniform convergence. Furthermore, we examine the special **uniform-memory** case \(\alpha=\beta\equiv1\), proving that \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}[x](t)\) **asymptotically recovers** the classical derivative \(\dot{x}(0)\) as \(t \to 0^{+}\), thereby ensuring consistency with standard calculus. The analysis is supported by self-contained appendices providing necessary technical tools. The framework developed here offers a well-defined mathematical object for describing memory-dependent dynamics, with potential utility in formulating and analyzing evolution equations that feature adaptively weighted historical information.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05120v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) determines the bulk evolution and observable emission in a wide variety of high-energy astrophysical phenomena. Due to their complexity, RHD problems must usually be studied through numerical simulation. We have extended the publicly available RICH code, which previously solved the equations of RHD in the limit of grey flux-limited diffusion (FLD), to operate with a multigroup FLD solver. RICH is a semi-Lagrangian code that solves the equations of RHD on an unstructured moving mesh, and is the first multigroup RHD moving mesh code, making it uniquely applicable to problems with extreme dynamic range and dynamically important radiation forces. We validate our multigroup module against multiple analytic benchmarks, including a novel test of the RHD Doppler term. The computational efficiency of the code is aided by a novel scheme to accelerate convergence in optically thick cells. Finally, we apply multigroup RICH in a pilot study of a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), using a $10^4 M_\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole. Our simulations self-consistently produce a bright early-time X-ray flash prior to peak optical/UV light, in qualitative agreement with post-processing of (grey) RICH simulations of supermassive black hole TDEs, as well as X-ray observations of the TDE AT 2022dsb.</p>

This mapping, which holds at all times, allows us to recast transitions in the population genome distribution as dynamical phase transitions, which can then be studied using the toolbox of large-deviation theory.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.09057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: By introducing an extra stack of D6-branes to standard ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, we extend the landscape of its complete search. In this construction, the $d$-stack of D6-branes is introduced besides the standard $a,~b,~c$-stacks. More intersections from the extra stacks of D6-branes appear, and thus Higgs/Higgs-like particles arise from more origins. Among these models, we find eight new classes of ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with gauge symmetries $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_{R_1}\times SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{R}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$, where $d$-stack of D6-branes carries the gauge symmetries $SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(2)_{L_2}$, respectively. The $SU(2)_{L_1/R_1} \times SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ can be broken down to the diagonal $SU(2)_{L/R}$ gauge symmetry via bifundamental Higgs fields. In such a way, we for the first time successfully constructed three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from non-rigid D6-branes with extra $d$-stacks of D6-branes as visible sectors. Interestingly, by introducing extra stack of D6-branes to the standard supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, the number of filler brane reduces in general, and eventually the models without any $USp(N)$ gauge symmetry present. This reduces the exotic particles from filler brane intersection yet provides more vector-like particles from ${\cal N}=2$ subsector that are useful in renormalization group equation evolution as an advantage. Moreover, interesting degeneracy behavior with the same gauge coupling ratio exists in certain class of models.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05031v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: When simulating three-dimensional flows interacting with deformable and elastic obstacles, current methods often encounter complexities in the governing equations and challenges in numerical implementation. In this work, we introduce a novel numerical formulation for simulating incompressible viscous flows at low Reynolds numbers in the presence of deformable interfaces. Our method employs a vorticity-stream vector formulation that significantly simplifies the fluid solver, transforming it into a set of coupled Poisson problems. The body-fluid interface is modeled using a phase field, allowing for the incorporation of various free-energy models to account for membrane bending and surface tension. In contrast to existing three-dimensional approaches, such as Lattice Boltzmann Methods or boundary-integral techniques, our formulation is lightweight and grounded in classical fluid mechanics principles, making it implementable with standard finite-difference techniques. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method by simulating the evolution of a single vesicle or droplet in Newtonian Poiseuille and Couette flows under different free-energy models, successfully recovering canonical axisymmetric shapes and stress profiles. Although this work primarily focuses on single-body dynamics in Newtonian suspending fluids, the framework can be extended to include body forces, inertial effects, and viscoelastic media.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04898v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Phase-field (PF) modeling is a powerful tool for simulating microstructure evolution. To overcome the high computational cost of PF in solving complex PDEs, machine learning methods such as PINNs, convLSTM have been used to predict PF evolution. However, current methods still face shortages of low flexibility, poor generalization and short predicting time length. In this work, we present a joint framework coupling voxel-flow network (VFN) with PF simulations in an alternating manner for long-horizon temporal prediction of microstructure evolution. The VFN iteratively predicts future evolution by learning the flow of pixels from past snapshots, with periodic boundaries preserved in the process. Periodical PF simulations suppresses nonphysical artifacts, reduces accumulated error, and extends reliable prediction time length. The VFN is about 1,000 times faster than PF simulation on GPU. In validation using grain growth and spinodal decomposition, MSE and SSIM remain 6.76% and 0.911 when predicted 18 frames from only 2 input frames, outperforming similar predicting methods. For an ultra-long grain growth prediction for 82 frames from 2 input frames, grain number decreases from 600 to 29 with NMSE of average grain area remaining 1.64%. This joint framework enables rapid, generalized, flexible and physically consistent microstructure forecasting from image-based data for ultra-long time scales.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2501.18620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: As a core element of culture, images transform perception into structured representations and undergo evolution similar to natural languages. Given that visual input accounts for 60% of human sensory experience, it is natural to ask whether images follow statistical regularities similar to those in linguistic systems. Guided by symbol-grounding theory, which posits that meaningful symbols originate from perception, we treat images as vision-centric artifacts and employ pre-trained neural networks to model visual processing. By detecting kernel activations and extracting pixels, we obtain text-like units, which reveal that these image-derived representations adhere to statistical laws such as Zipf&#x27;s, Heaps&#x27;, and Benford&#x27;s laws, analogous to linguistic data. Notably, these statistical regularities emerge spontaneously, without the need for explicit symbols or hybrid architectures. Our results indicate that connectionist networks can automatically develop structured, quasi-symbolic units through perceptual processing alone, suggesting that text- and symbol-like properties can naturally emerge from neural networks and providing a novel perspective for interpretation.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This biomedical study shows that [225Ac]Ac-FAPI-04 radionuclide therapy induces DNA damage and remodels the tumor microenvironment via IL-27/JAK-STAT activation and Tnfaip3 downregulation to enhance cytotoxic T cell immunity, but it is not relevant to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Background: Accumulating evidence substantiates the capacity of targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) to potentiate tumor immunotherapy responses. However, combining TRT and immunotherapies exhibits substantial varying efficacy, underscoring the importance of investigating mechanisms through which TRT remodels the tumor microenvironment (TME). Despite recent advancements, the specific signaling molecules mediated by TRT that regulate the functions of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) remain unclear. Methods: Given the demonstrated potential of -radionuclides targeting the fibroblast activation protein (FAP) in TRT, this study employed [225Ac]Ac-FAPI-04 to investigate the mechanisms of TRT-induced TME remodeling. The cytotoxic effects were first evaluated in the B16F10 cell line, followed by an assessment of its in vivo therapeutic efficacy in tumor-bearing mice. RNA-sequencing analysis was utilized to elucidate underlying signaling pathways involving immune responses. Results: [225Ac]Ac-FAPI-04 significantly induced DNA double-strand breaks, further elevated ROS levels, and apoptosis in tumor cells. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that [225Ac]Ac-FAPI-04 activates the IL-27/JAK-STAT pathway to amplify interferon-mediated responses, indicating IL-27 serves as a critical regulatory signal for CTLs during TRT. A concomitant observation was the downregulation of Tnfaip3 following [225Ac]Ac-FAPI-04 treatment. Tnfaip3 is implicated in modulating CTLs&#x27; behavior and intratumoral infiltration, while its downregulation was associated with the upregulation of cytotoxic effector molecules, as confirmed in this study. Conclusion: This study identifies a TRT-induced pattern of synergistic signaling mediated by IL-27 and Tnfaip3, which collectively enhances CTL recruitment and potentiates their cytotoxic function. These findings provide a detailed mechanistic rationale for strategies aimed at augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of TRT and immunotherapy combinations.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Using engineered recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae × S. paradoxus hybrids and lab evolution, the study finds hybrid fitness is shaped mainly by widespread weak, background-dependent genetic incompatibilities and compensatory adaptation rather than rare strong lethal incompatibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Species barriers limit gene flow and maintain co-adapted genomes. Interspecific hybridization can break down species barriers to reveal genetic incompatibilities. Although the phenotypic and genomic consequences of hybridization have been extensively studied in many systems, far less is known about the longer-term evolutionary dynamics of highly divergent, mosaic genomes and the extent to which genetic incompatibilities shape their adaptation. In yeast, pre-zygotic barriers are weak but post-zygotic barriers are strong due to mispairing of chromosomes during meiosis. By suppressing anti-recombination genes in meiosis, we generated a panel of 20 haploid recombinant hybrids from a cross between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its sister species, Saccharomyces paradoxus. Across conditions, these hybrids are, on average, less fit than either parent and show broad phenotypic variation. Inheritance patterns of protein complexes in the hybrid genomes reveal no evidence of pairwise lethality but do support a model of pervasive weak negative genetic interactions in hybrid protein complexes. We show by laboratory evolution that each recombinant genome follows a distinct evolutionary trajectory, and a small subset of hybrid protein complexes and loci show hybrid-specific mutational targeting. Finally, we show that species-of-origin alleles can bias evolutionary outcomes by reshaping selection on interacting genes. Together, our results suggest that strong pairwise incompatibilities are rare, while weak, background-dependent incompatibilities are widespread and shape fitness and adaptation in hybrid genomes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The 14-3-3 protein family, with over 1300 binding partners, is one of the largest regulators of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in eukaryotic cells. They recognise and bind to phosphorylation-related motifs in their partner proteins, creating scaffolds to stabilise proteins and allowing or inhibiting kinases` access to their targets. 14-3-3 consists of seven isoforms ({beta}, {gamma}, {epsilon}, {zeta}, , {theta} and {sigma}), which are expressed across all tissues. Given their important role in PPIs, their dysregulation can contribute to a variety of diseases, such as cancer or neurodegenerative disorders like Creutzfeldt-Jakob`s, Parkinson`s or Alzheimer`s diseases. Pathological effects can arise due to loss of function, aberrant interactions or protein aggregation. Notably, 14-3-3 aggregates have been detected in Lewy bodies or cerebrospinal fluid, mirroring the presence of amyloid proteins, such as -synuclein or {beta}-amyloid. Toxic amyloid aggregation signals the onset of neurodegeneration, which can occur through misfolding of proteins or liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) -- a process during which proteins condense into membraneless organelles. Unlike other amyloidogenic proteins, there is little information on the conditions under which the 14-3-3 protein family members undergo LLPS or their relationship with amyloid aggregation. To address this gap, we examined all isoforms of 14-3-3 in vitro and observed the formation of amyloid aggregates and phase-separated droplets. Our results revealed that the {epsilon} and {theta} isoforms form worm-like fibrils, and molecular crowding conditions promote phase separation in most of the 14-3-3 proteins.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Ophrys orchids (or bee orchids) provide an outstanding example of a plant adaptive radiation. Over the last five million years, this genus has diversified into hundreds of taxa as a result of its unconventional pollination strategy, known as &#x27;sexual swindling&#x27;. However, the rapid and substantial diversification of this genus, combined with its capacity for hybridisation and large genome size, poses significant challenges in addressing its systematics. We used phylotranscriptomics as a genome complexity reduction technique to infer the phylogenetic relationships among Ophrys main lineages. More than seven thousand gene trees enabled us to determine the relative contributions of gene flow and incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) in Ophrys evolution. First, we propose a new phylogenetic hypothesis for the genus with an unprecedented resolution that largely confirms the relationships between the main Ophrys lineages, but also provides new insights within each sub-genera. By combining phylogenetic network inference with introgression analyses based on gene tree topologies and branch lengths, we then show that the numerous phylogenetic incongruences among gene tree topologies result from a pervasive background of ILS, over which stand out several well-supported, ancient and potentially adaptive gene flow events between lineages. These major gene flow events provide a new perspective on the evolution of the Ophrys genus and its pollination, questioning previous hypotheses inferred without considering its reticulate evolution, and providing a better understanding of discrepancies observed among previous phylogenetic studies of the genus.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding how transcriptional output and chromatin accessibility coordinate across cellular states remains a central challenge in multimodal single-cell biology. Here, we establish explicit hierarchical empirical bounds on RNA-chromatin statistical dependence using a strictly falsification-driven, information-theoretic analysis of paired RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. Our contribution is not to assert universal coupling, but to quantify the maximum intra-state coupling that survives adversarial nulls, thereby converting qualitative intuition into empirical bounds. Leveraging unimodal latent representations and adversarial null models, we quantify both the existence and the limits of cross-modal dependence across organizational scales. At the population level, global RNA-ATAC mutual information is strong and reproducible across donors, but is shown to be overwhelmingly dominated by cell-type composition rather than fine-grained regulatory coordination. When cellular state is explicitly controlled, intra-state RNA-ATAC coupling collapses to null expectations in the majority of populations, directly falsifying the hypothesis of a universal within-state regulatory channel. Despite this collapse, a weak but statistically robust residual coupling persists in a restricted subset of highly dynamic states, including erythroid differentiation compartments, activated T cells, and NK cells. This residual signal survives stringent local permutation tests and conditional mutual information analysis, demonstrating that it cannot be reduced to compositional mixing alone. Quantitatively, residual within-state dependence is consistently an order of magnitude smaller than global dependence, placing an empirical upper bound on within-state RNA-ATAC coordination in this dataset. Donor-resolved ratios rho = I(R;A|S)/I(R;A) indicate that most of the global dependence is removed by conditioning on state; operationally, we refer to the removed fraction (1 - rho) as composition-dominated dependence. Throughout, &quot;state-contingent statistical dependence&quot; is used strictly as an operational descriptor rather than a causal claim: mutual information and conditional mutual information quantify statistical dependence only, not directionality or mechanism. This framing constrains downstream mechanistic interpretation and future multimodal modeling.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> DeepKOALA is a fast GRU-based deep learning tool for KEGG Orthology assignment that accelerates large-scale DNA/protein functional annotation but is only indirectly relevant to origins-of-life research as a general bioinformatics enabler.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The KEGG Orthology (KO) system links DNA and protein sequences to biological functions and pathways, providing a curated, fundamental and consistent annotation framework across all domains of life. While accurate, traditional sequence alignment-based annotation methods are computationally expensive, which severely limits their application in large-scale datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce DeepKOALA, a deep learning approach based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), which frames KO annotation as an open-set recognition task. This design reduces false positives arising from out-of-scope sequences and, together with a lightweight GRU backbone, enables high-throughput annotation. The GRU-based model was benchmarked against four other deep learning architectures and showed the best balance between speed and accuracy. We further performed a cross-species evaluation of DeepKOALA in comparison with existing KO annotation tools, where it achieved an F1-score of 0.8653 and 37.5-fold acceleration compared with BlastKOALA. We also provide a specialized fragment model for handling incomplete sequences and an optional Multi-domain mode.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spatial organization of transcription machinery is emerging as a key regulator of gene expression, yet how RNA polymerases are organized at gene clusters remains unclear. Here, we show that RNA polymerases II and polymerase III form distinct nuclear foci at the 5S ribosomal DNA (rDNA)-Spliced leader 1 (SL1) cluster in C. elegans. Within this cluster, polymerase II binds to the SL1 gene, while polymerase III associates with 5S rDNA. Both polymerase foci display dynamic but distinct behaviors within the nucleus. The assembly of these polymerase foci is regulated across the cell cycle. ATTF-6, an AT-hook transcription factor, is essential for polymerases II foci formation but dispensable for polymerases III foci. While Pol III foci are largely resistant to temperature changes, Pol II foci are temperature-sensitive, and their dissolution correlates with reduced SL1 expression. Together, these results reveal a spatial and temporal regulation of two RNA polymerases that organize gene cluster transcription.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Proposes a Bayesian circuit–Hamiltonian “Gated Quantum Resonator” formalism to model catalysis and tunneling/coherence effects in complex reactive systems, offering a potentially useful (but indirect) theoretical tool for origins-of-life chemistry via improved mechanistic discrimination without explicit long-timescale MD/QM-MM trajectories.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Molecular dynamics (MD) and hybrid quantum–classical (QM/MM) methods provide powerful tools for simulating chemical and biological systems, yet their application to long-timescale, strongly coupled processes remains limited by non-integrability, chaotic sensitivity, and extreme time-scale separation. These limitations motivate complementary formalisms that emphasize structure, constraint, and evidence integration over brute-force trajectory resolution. Here we introduce the Gated Quantum Resonator (GQR) framework, a Bayesian circuit–Hamiltonian formalism in which reactive coordinates are modeled as coupled vibronic–electronic resonators with gateable interactions. Linearization around operating points maps the effective Hamiltonian onto electrical network analogues, enabling transparent parameterization and rapid Bayesian updating from spectroscopic and mechanistic evidence. The framework provides a unified language for describing non-Arrhenius kinetics, tunnelling assisted by constrained vibronic coherence, and mode-selective transport in open quantum systems. Without resolving full many-body trajectories, GQR identifies protected dynamical subspaces in which coherent evolution can persist under environmental coupling. This formulation is applicable across enzymatic catalysis, heterogeneous and electrocatalytic systems, and radiative phenomena, offering a tractable complement to conventional simulation approaches for hypothesis generation, model reduction, and mechanistic discrimination.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Reports a minimalist nucleolin-derived peptide that selectively binds and stabilizes the otherwise unstable RNA i-motif at higher pH, highlighting plausible peptide–RNA recognition mechanisms relevant to early nucleic-acid structural regulation.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Folded RNA structures are increasingly being recognised as key regulators in biological processes, yet the RNA i-motif remains poorly characterised due to its low stability and lack of selective molecular probes. Here, we describe the first small molecule – a short peptide – that binds the elusive RNA i-motif. Our minimalist peptide RGGFGGRGG is derived from the intrinsically disordered region of the protein Nucleolin and binds to folded RNA over DNA with &gt;5x selectivity. The binding of two peptide molecules folds the RNA i-motif at a higher pH than under native conditions. This folded, peptide-bound structure can still bind other guests, such as the intercalator thiazole orange, displaying heteroallosteric properties. Our peptide binding is driven by more than simple electrostatic attraction, exploiting the subtle differences in steric complementarity and hydration of the compact RNA structures relative to DNA congeners and unfolded strands. Our findings underline the potential of minimalistic peptide scaffolds as selective binders for non-canonical RNA structures, allowing for the probing and modulation of RNA topologies.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Cronin and Walker extend assembly theory to quantify “material causation” via an assembly index and copy number, proposing a selection threshold in assembly space that operationally demarcates life and open-ended evolution as persistent, high-assembly structures.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Leroy Cronin, Sara I. Walker Assembly theory (AT) introduces a concept of causation as a material property, constitutive of a metrology of evolution and selection. The physical scale for causation is quantified with the assembly index, defined as the minimum number of steps necessary for a distinguishable object to exist, where steps are assembled recursively. Observing countable copies of high assembly index objects indicates that a mechanism to produce them is persistent, such that the object&#x27;s environment builds a memory that traps causation within a contingent chain. Copy number and assembly index underlie the standardized metrology for detecting causation (assembly index), and evidence of contingency (copy number). Together, these allow the precise definition of a selective threshold in assembly space, understood as the set of all causal possibilities. This threshold demarcates life (and its derivative agential, intelligent and technological forms) as structures with persistent copies beyond the threshold. In introducing a fundamental concept of material causation to explain and measure life, AT represents a departure from prior theories of causation, such as interventional ones, which have so far proven incompatible with fundamental physics. We discuss how AT&#x27;s concept of causation provides the foundation for a theory of physics where novelty, contingency and the potential for open-endedness are fundamental, and determinism is emergent along assembled lineages.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chirality can arise through supramolecular curvature that resolves geometric frustrations in the packing of bent, achiral molecular or colloidal building blocks. Here, we leverage orthogonal protection-deprotection click chemistry to create sequence-defined mesogenic heterodimers exhibiting emergent chirality. We compare the hierarchical self-assembly of the synthesized asymmetric, achiral heterodimers which differ only in the position of a methyl substituent. Both dimers form chiral spherulites composed of nanocylinders. However, the detailed arrangement of nanocylinders depends on the position of the methyl substituent and the crystallization conditions. Despite the chemical similarity, in one dimer, two crystalline forms exhibit optical rotation indicating the presence of chiral domains, while the crystalline phase of the other dimer does not exhibit optical rotation yet adopts a chiral assembly of nanocylinders. We propose that differences in nanocylinder arrangements may arise from changes in nanocylinder curvature and dimensions dictated by the methyl substituent position, inducing these divergent spontaneously chiral behaviors. These results highlight the role of sequence and molecular design in directing the bottom-up hierarchical self-assembly and chirality of mesogenic systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03399v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: A multifractal model is used to analyze neutron evolution within a reactor. For chain reactions, various characteristics of multifractal neutron behavior have been determined. These include the dimension of the multifractal carrier, information and correlation dimensions, the entropy of the fractal set, maximum and minimum dimension values, and the multifractal spectrum function. The geometric features of a multifractal allow for the description of a stochastic system consisting of hierarchically subordinate statistical ensembles, which are characterized by Cayley trees. A stationary distribution over hierarchical levels is established, which follows the Tsallis power law. The text also points out some potential applications of fractal patterns in nuclear reactor theory. The chance of percolation, which is when we see a state in the Bethe lattice where there&#x27;s at least one continuous path through neighboring conducting nodes all the way across, is similar to the likelihood of a self-sustaining fission chain reaction happening. When this probability hits a critical point, we get a (conditionally) infinite cluster of neutrons forming. The percolation probability, influenced by how long the reactor has been running and its size, is linked to the reactor&#x27;s criticality. We take a look at how the neutron multiplication factor behaves over time. We especially focus on the early stages of a self-sustaining nuclear fission chain reaction. We also highlight the ways to identify the boundaries of the critical region.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2504.20576v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We consider a Klein-Gordon-Wave system, describing the evolution of a massive field and a massless one interacting through a Yukawa-like coupling, and we explicitly derive its Hamiltonian normal form to first and second order. To the first-order approximation, the normal form results in a Schr\&quot;odinger-Wave system, which reduces to the Schr\&quot;odinger-Poisson one in the singular limit of vanishing perturbative parameter. The second-order approximation provides the successive corrections to the Schr\&quot;odinger-Wave system, and is presented in order to show that higher-order approximations to all orders can be obtained by iterating our constructive procedure. The normal form technique adopted here formally extends the standard Birkhoff normal form procedure for harmonic oscillators to include a set of free particles in the unperturbed problem. The mathematical result obtained here might explain, for example, the &quot;cooling&quot; process of ultra-light dark matter, the approximate validity of the Schr\&quot;odinger-Poisson system describing its dynamics and the long term conservation of the total dark matter mass.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03335v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to evolve solutions to problems in many domains, in a process inspired by biological evolution. However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called &quot;Red Queen&quot; dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03408v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: With the arrival of JWST observations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, it is timely to reassess the contribution of tidal heating to their heat budget. JWST thermal phase curves could reveal endogenic heating through an anomalously high nightside temperature, providing an opportunity to estimate tidal heating. In this study, we revisit the tidal heating of these planets and propose a simple method to compute the tidal heating profile across a broad range of parameters. Our approach leverages a known formulation for synchronously rotating planets on low-eccentricity orbits and the fact that the profile shape depends solely on internal structure. We calculate the tidal heating contributions for all T-1 planets, with a particular focus on the impact of internal structure and eccentricity uncertainties on their total heat budget. Although the masses and radii of these planets are well constrained, degeneracies remain in their internal structure and composition. For volatile-poor planets of silicate-rock compositions, we investigate the role of core iron content by exploring a range of core sizes. For each structure, we compute the degree-two gravitational Love number, $k_2$, and the corresponding tidal heating profiles. We assume sub-solidus temperatures profiles that are decoupled from interior heat production, which means our estimates are conservative and likely represent minimum values. We find that the tidal heat flux for T-1b and c can exceed Io&#x27;s heat flux, with uncertainties primarily driven by eccentricity. These high fluxes may be detectable with JWST. For T-1f to g, the tidal flux remains below Earth&#x27;s geothermal flux, suggesting that tidal heating is unlikely to be the dominant energy source. For planets d and e, however, tidal heating likely dominates their heat budget, potentially driving intense volcanic and tectonic activity, which could enhance their habitability prospects.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces ARRDE, a Differential Evolution variant with nonlinear population-size reduction and adaptive restart-refine, validated as top-performing across multiple CEC benchmark suites but not related to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.18429v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: This study is motivated by a robustness issue in numerical optimization of bound-constrained problems: many algorithms that perform well on a particular benchmark suite, such as the IEEE CEC2017 problems, struggle to maintain the same level of performance when applied to other suites that differ in dimensionality, landscape complexity, or the maximum number of function evaluations ($N_{\text{max}}$). To address this, we propose the Adaptive Restart-Refine Differential Evolution (ARRDE) algorithm, a new variant of Differential Evolution (DE). ARRDE builds upon the LSHADE algorithm, incorporates key mechanisms from jSO, and introduces a nonlinear population-size reduction strategy combined with an adaptive restart-refine mechanism. We evaluate ARRDE on five benchmark suites (CEC2011, CEC2017, CEC2019, CEC2020, and CEC2022) which, to the best of our knowledge, constitutes the most extensive experimental study to date in the context of algorithmic comparison, as most prior works consider only one or two suites. This broad evaluation enables a rigorous assessment of generalization across markedly different problem characteristics. To further support fair cross-suite comparisons, we also introduce a bounded accuracy-based scoring metric derived from relative error. Using both rank-based and accuracy-based metrics, and comparing against algorithms that perform strongly on CEC2017 (e.g., jSO and LSHADE-cnEpSin) as well as those that excel on CEC2020 (e.g., j2020 and NLSHADE-RSP), ARRDE consistently demonstrates top-tier performance, ranking first across all benchmark suites considered. These results highlight ARRDE&#x27;s robustness and its superior generalization capability.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04032v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The models that most successfully reproduce the orbital architecture of the Solar System terrestrial planets start from a narrow annulus of material that grows into embryos and then planets. However, it is not clear how this ring model can be made consistent with the chemical structure of the inner Solar System, which shows a reduced-to-oxidized gradient from Mercury to Mars and a parallel gradient in the asteroid belt. We propose that there were two primary reservoirs in the early inner Solar System: a narrow, refractory enriched ring inside of 1 au, and a less massive, extended planetesimal disk outside of 1 au with oxidation states ranging from enstatite chondrites to ordinary chondrites. We show through a suite of N-body simulations that an inwardly sweeping secular resonance, caused by aerodynamic drag and perturbations from a mean-motion resonant Jupiter and Saturn, gathers the outer planetesimal disk into a narrow ring that migrates radially, forms Mars, and contributes oxidized material to proto-Earth. Remaining unaccreted planetesimals can be implanted into the asteroid belt as the parent bodies of aubrites and non-carbonaceous iron meteorites, while the most reduced material is not implanted and thus unsampled in the meteorite collection. This model explains the oxidation and isotopic gradients within the inner Solar System within the context of a low-viscosity, magnetic wind-driven disk.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03951v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Context. Understanding the optical properties of astrophysical ices is crucial for modeling dust continuum emission and radiative transfer in cold, dense interstellar environments. Molecular nitrogen (N$_2$), a major nitrogen reservoir in protoplanetary disks, plays a key role in nitrogen chemistry, yet the lack of direct terahertz (THz)--infrared (IR) optical constants for N$_2$ ice introduces uncertainties in radiative transfer models, snowline locations, and disk mass estimates. Aims. We present direct measurements of the optical properties of N$_2$ ice over a broad THz--IR spectral range using terahertz pulsed spectroscopy (TPS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and comparison with literature data. Methods. N$_2$ ice was grown at cryogenic temperatures by gas-phase deposition onto a cold silicon window. The THz complex refractive index was directly reconstructed from TPS data, while the IR response was derived from FTIR measurements using Kramers--Kronig relations. The optical response was parameterized with a Lorentz dielectric model and validated by DFT calculations. Results. The complex refractive index of N$_2$ ice is quantified from $\nu = 0.3$--$16$~THz ($\lambda = 1$~mm--$18.75~\mu$m). Resonant absorption peaks at $\nu_\mathrm{L} = 1.47$ and $2.13$~THz with damping constants $\gamma_\mathrm{L} = 0.03$ and $0.22$~THz are attributed to optically active phonons of the $\alpha$-N$_2$ crystal. Conclusions. We provide a complete set of the THz--IR optical constants for \ce{N2} ice by combining TPS and FTIR spectroscopy. Our results have implications for future observational and modeling studies of protoplanetary disk evolution and planet formation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03932v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Planets with masses between Earth and Neptune often have radii that imply the presence of volatiles, suggesting that water may be abundant in their interiors. However, directly observing the precise water mass fraction and water distribution remains unfeasible. In our study, we employ an internal structure code MAGRATHEA to model planets with high water content and explore potential interior distributions. Departing from traditional assumptions of a layered structure, we determine water and rock distribution based on water-rock miscibility criteria. We model {wet planets} with an iron core and a homogeneous mixture of rock and water above it. At the outer regions of the planet, the pressure and temperature are below the rock-water miscibility point (the second critical point), causing the segregation of water and rock. Consequently, a shell of water is formed in the outermost layers. By considering the water-rock miscibility and the vapor state of water, our approach highlights the uncertainty in estimating the water mass fraction of detected exoplanets.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03963v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how external photo-evaporation influences the formation, dynamical evolution and the resultant planetary architecture of multi-planet systems born in stellar clusters. We use a model of N-body simulations of multiple planet formation via pebble accretion coupled with a 1-D viscous disc subject to external photo-evaporation. We found that external photo-evaporation reduces the planet growth by reducing the pebble mass reservoir in discs containing multiple planetary embryos across a wide range of disc masses, and is particularly effective in suppressing planet growth in less initially massive discs (&lt; 0.1 M$_{\odot}$). However, in more initially massive ($\geq$ 0.1 M$_{\oplus}$) discs planets lost due to planet-planet interactions dominate the outcome for final resultant total planet mass, masking the effects of external photo-evaporation in curbing the planet mass growth. In terms of the final resulting planetary architectures, the signature of external photo-evaporation is visible in less massive (&lt; 0.1 M$_{\odot}$) discs, with fewer numbers and lower masses of planets surviving in discs irradiated with stronger external FUV radiation. External photo-evaporation also leaves a signature for the wide orbit (&gt; 10 au) terrestrial planets (0.1 - 1 M$_{\oplus}$), with fewer planets populating this region for stronger FUV field. Finally, the 1st-order resonant pairs fraction decreases with stronger FUV radiation, although the resonant pairs occur rarely regardless of the FUV radiation environment, due to the small number of planets that survive gravitational encounters.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03990v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We analyse the association between the NEAs 2021 PH27 and 2025 GN1, which share similar heliocentric Keplerian elements and the same taxonomic classification. First, we confirm the spectral similarity by getting independent colours measurements of 2025 GN1 and confirming that they are both X-type. From numerical integration of the orbits up to 100 kyr in the past, taking into account relativistic corrections, we found that the two asteroids experienced five similar flybys with Venus, but none of them were closer than the Roche limit. The perihelion distance also reached values between 0.1 and 0.08 au about 17/21 kyr and 45/48 kyr ago, but still well outside the Roche limit with the Sun. So, the origin of the pair by tidal disruption of a progenitor rubble-pile asteroid appears unlikely. On the other hand, we found periods lasting several thousand years where the perihelion was below 0.1 au, and this can lead to thermal fracturing of the surface. We found that the rotation period of the primary and the mass ratio secondary/primary make the pair indistinguishable from the binary systems known among the NEAs, and the YORP effect can double the rotation period of 2021 PH27 in $150 \pm 50$ kyr. So it is plausible that the pair was formed by the rotational disintegration of a rubble-pile asteroid due to anisotropic gas emission or the YORP effect, which formed a binary system that later dissolved due to the internal dynamics of the pair. We are unable to give a value for the separation age; we can only say that it occurred more than 10.5 kyr ago and may have occurred between 17/21 kyr ago during the last and longer phase of lower perihelion distance. In this scenario, little meteoroids released in space due to the fragmentation event are still near the pair&#x27;s orbit and can generate a meteor shower in Venus&#x27; atmosphere.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03350v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The context of the Sun in the galactic neighborhood is not well understood, especially when we compare its physical properties to those of nearby stars. Thereby, we still cannot fully comprehend whether or not the Sun is a typical star. This work aims to identify and characterize stars aligned with the solar evolutionary track that could represent it at the ZAMS and subgiant stages. We performed a spectroscopic analysis of 18 photometrically selected candidates using high-resolution and high-SNR spectra as well as the classical spectroscopic method, based on the excitation and ionization equilibria of Fe I and Fe II lines. Additionally, we derived evolutionary parameters using isochrones, and kinematic parameters. We also estimated chromospheric activity levels and performed age estimates through 3 additional independent methods: activity-age relations using the Ca II H $\&amp;$ K and H$\alpha$ lines, and rotation periods estimated from TESS light curves. We identified three candidates that provide a good match to the Sun at $\approx$ 0.5 Gyr (HD 13531 and HD 61033) and subgiant (HD 148577) stages. Moreover, HD 197210 could be of interest when studying the Sun at $\approx$ 2 Gyr, when the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere started having a significant amount of oxygen. Our selection method was successful and we were able to identify stars similar to the Sun at different evolutionary stages, which is essential for future research in the search of exoplanets and understand habitability, especially with the advent of the next generation of exoplanet-hunting instruments.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.23542v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Surviving rapid inward orbital migration is a crucial aspect of formation models for the Jupiter&#x27;s Galilean moons. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the orbital migration of the Galilean moons by incorporating self-consistent solid dynamics in circumjovian disk models. We perform two-fluid simulations using the FARGO3D code on a 2D polar grid. The simulations model a satellite with the mass of a proto-moon, Europa, or Ganymede interacting with a circumjovian disk. The dust component, coupled to the gas via a drag force, is characterized by the dust-to-gas mass ratio ($\epsilon$) and the Stokes number ($T_s$). The effect of solids fundamentally alter the satellites&#x27; evolution. We identify a vast parameter space where migration is slowed, halted, robustly reversed -leading to outward migration-, or significantly accelerated inward. The migration rate is dependent on satellite mass, providing a natural source of differential migration. Solid dynamics provides a robust and self-consistent mechanism that fundamentally alters the migration of the Galilean moons, potentially addressing the long-standing migration catastrophe. This mechanism critically affects the survival of satellites and could offer a viable physical process to explain the establishment of resonances through differential migration. These findings establish that solid torques are a critical, non-negligible factor in shaping the final architecture of satellite systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04091v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The earliest stages of disk formation and dust evolution during the protostellar phase remain poorly constrained. Millimeter dust emission and its polarization provide key insights into the physical processes and material distribution at the envelope-disk interface. We present ALMA polarimetric observations at 1.4 mm and 3 mm of two young stellar objects in Taurus, IRAS 04166+2706 (K04166) and IRAS 04169+2702 (K04169), probing scales from 25 au to 3000 au. We model the Stokes I emission to separate disk and envelope contributions and analyze the polarization properties to identify the dominant polarization mechanisms. K04166 shows extended Stokes I and polarized emission tracing a tentative hourglass magnetic field morphology in its envelope. In the inner envelope and disk (&lt; 100 au), the properties of the polarized emission change, suggesting either a toroidal magnetic field or the presence of large grains. In contrast, K04169 exhibits compact Stokes I and polarized emission consistent with self-scattering from the disk. Both disks are extremely compact, but only K04166 retains a substantial envelope. Our multiscale ALMA polarimetric observations reveal a transition from magnetically aligned grains in envelopes to self-scattering in disks within the transition region of 20-50 au. These results provide important clues on dust grain growth and magnetic field morphology at the disk-envelope scales. Despite being embedded in the same filament, the two sources display striking differences, indicating that K04166 is a young embedded object with a substantial envelope threaded by relatively organized magnetic fields. Meanwhile, K04169 is more evolved, likely to be a young T-Tauri star. However, in both disks, the presence of large grains already suggests a scenario of early dust evolution in disks of the Class 0 stage.</p>

Here, we use {\&quot;O}pik&#x27;s close-encounter framework to study the random walk of the orbital energy $x$ for an ensemble of test particles on planet-crossing orbits. We show that the evolution of each particle&#x27;s orbital elements $(a, e, i)$ is fully encapsulated by the 3D rotation of the relative velocity vector $\bm{U}_\infty$, whose magnitude remains constant. Consequently, the system can be reduced to two degrees of freedom. By averaging over all possible flyby geometries, we derive explicit expressions for the drift and diffusion coefficients of $x$. We then solve the resulting Fokker--Planck equation to obtain a closed-form solution for the time evolution of the particle distribution. A characteristic scattering timescale naturally emerges, scaling as $(P_{p}/M_{p}^{2})/500$, where $P_{p}$ is the planet&#x27;s orbital period and $M_{p}$ its mass ratio to the central star. The typical ejection speed of small bodies by a planet is estimated to be $3 v_p M_{p}^{1/3}$, where $v_p$ is the planet&#x27;s orbital speed. Our analytical solution constitutes a universal law applicable to both the Solar System and exoplanetary systems, providing a computationally efficient alternative to costly $N$-body simulations for studying the orbital distributions and ejection of planetesimals and planets (e.g., Kuiper Belt, Oort Cloud, debris disks, interstellar objects, and free-floating planets).</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03472v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We develop a kinetic-theory framework to investigate the steady rheology of a dilute gas interacting via a repulsive potential under uniform shear flow. Starting from the Boltzmann equation with a restitution coefficient that depends on the impact velocity and potential strength, we derive evolution equations for the stress tensor based on Grad&#x27;s moment expansion. The resulting expressions for the collisional rates and transport coefficients are fitted with simple analytical functions that capture their temperature dependence over a wide range of shear rates. Comparison with direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) results shows excellent quantitative agreement for the shear stress, temperature anisotropy, and steady viscosity. We also analyze the velocity distribution functions, revealing that the system remains nearly Maxwellian even under strong shear.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.05427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Stellar and planetary magnetic fields play a crucial role in the habitability of a planet and the integrity of its atmosphere. The recently claimed detection of biosignatures, methane, carbon dioxide and dimethyl sulfide/disulfide, in the atmosphere of K2-18 b, a sub-Neptune orbiting an M dwarf star present an intriguing question regarding the stellar magnetic environment and the resistance of the planet&#x27;s magnetosphere (if it exists) to erosion by magnetic activity from the host. To probe for radio emission from the system, we have conducted observations using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at S, C and X-bands (2-4, 4.5-7.5 and 8-10 GHz respectively) to search for coherent and incoherent radio emission. We detect no radio emission associated with incoherent emission mechanisms. We report $3\sigma$ Stokes I upper limits of $49.8\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at S-band, $17.7\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$at C-band and $18.0\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at X-band and an upper limit of the ratio of the radio to the total bolometric luminosity of $\log L_\text{R}/\log L_\text{bol}&lt;-8.8$. We have also searched for short duration bursts associated with coherent emission mechanisms at C and X-bands . No signals above a $3\sigma$ significance threshold are detected. Although no signals are detected our radio observations offer constraints, albeit limited, on the stellar magnetic environment supporting recent X-ray observations indicating K2-18 is a very faint emitter. Our results also contextualise any planetary transmission spectra by providing constraints on the activity level of the host.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04105v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Conformable derivatives provide a fractional-looking calculus that remains local and admits a simple representation through classical derivatives with explicit weights. In this paper we develop a systematic operator-theoretic perspective showing that conformable time evolution is, in essence, a classical $C_0$-semigroup observed through a nonlinear clock. We introduce the conformable time map $\psi(t)=t^\alpha/\alpha$ and prove that every $C_0$--$\alpha$-semigroup $\{T_\alpha(t)\}_{t\ge0}$ can be written as $T_\alpha(t)=T(\psi(t))$ for a uniquely determined classical $C_0$-semigroup $\{T(s)\}_{s\ge0}$, with generators agreeing on a common domain. This correspondence yields a one-to-one transfer of mild solutions and shows that orbit-based linear dynamics are invariant under conformable reparametrization. In particular, $\alpha$-hypercyclicity and $\alpha$--chaos coincide with the usual notions for the associated classical semigroup. As a consequence, we obtain a conformable version of the Desch--Schappacher--Webb spectral criterion for chaos. We also place the analysis in the natural functional setting provided by conformable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p,\alpha}$ and their explicit isometric identification with standard $L^p$ spaces, which allows one to transport estimates and spectral arguments without loss. The results clarify which dynamical phenomena in conformable models are genuinely new and which are inherited from classical semigroup dynamics via a nonlinear change of time.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.06439v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We present spatially resolved ALMA observations of the water line at 183 GHz in the disk around the Herbig star HD 100546. The water vapor emission peaks at the inner edge of the warm dust cavity, located ~15 au from the central star. We attribute this to thermal desorption at the water snowline, shifted outward at the dust cavity wall directly heated by the intense radiation. This represents the first spatially resolved image of the water snowline using ALMA observations of the main water isotopologue in a protoplanetary disk. The water emission morphology peaking inside the first dust ring is consistent with previous ALMA detections of oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules in the disk, including thermally desorbed methanol. These findings signal that warm cavities of transition disks provide ideal targets to directly reconstruct the spatial distribution of water vapor and the snowline location with ALMA, and directly connect water vapor emission to ice desorption of complex organic species.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03334v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Scalable hydrogen production using proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers depends on overcoming efficiency losses arising from coupled multiphase, multicomponent transport and interfacial phenomena across the membrane electrode assembly. Here, we demonstrate a multiscale computational framework that combines pore network modeling with finite-element-based reactive transport simulations to accurately and efficiently resolve structure-performance trade-offs in porous transport layers (PTLs). We perform experiments for both commercial single-layer PTLs and microporous layer (MPL)-integrated configurations to benchmark the electrochemical model, achieving excellent agreement between modeling and measurements. We show that in single-layer PTLs, open porous networks facilitate mass transport but incur large voltage penalties from PTL-anode catalyst layer (ACL) contact resistance. Bilayer architectures with dense MPLs reduce these losses by simultaneously improving transport, contact, and structural stability. Finally, in stratified multilayer stacks, combining fine pores near the ACL with highly porous backing layers delivers superior performance at high current densities. Altogether, these results establish mechanistic guidelines for porosity-informed PTL design that minimize interfacial resistance and enable high-efficiency PEMWE operation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03887v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The microscopic and fundamental origin of slide electrification, where droplets of water move across insulating surfaces accumulating and depositing electrical charges, is still debated. Charge transfer is often attributed to ion transfer at the receding contact line. However, it is still unclear whether ion transfer alone can fully account for the observed charge separation. We examined slide electrification of two polar, self-ionizing liquids (water, formamide) and two non-polar liquids (diiodomethane, bromonaphthalene). By cooling below the melting temperature, we were able to compare this process to tribocharging of the respective frozen components. Despite having ions immobilized at sub-freezing temperatures, the ice of the polar liquids continues to accumulate significant charge. Non-polar liquids exhibit lower charging (&lt;25% of polar liquids) and nearly identical charging behaviour in both their liquid and frozen phases on five different substrates. Since non-polar liquids contain few free ions, these observations indicate an alternative charging mechanism, which could be electron transfer. Our findings suggest that slide electrification operates through two mechanisms, with the dominant charge transfer pathway shifting between ions and electron transfer depending on the electronegativity, phase, and temperature.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03935v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Gas-radiation coupling critically influences hypersonic reentry flows, where extreme temperatures induce pronounced non-equilibrium gas and radiative heat transport. Accurate and efficient simulation of radiative gas dynamics is therefore indispensable for reliable design of thermal protection systems for atmospheric entry vehicles. In this study, a Boltzmann-type kinetic model for radiative gas flows is solved across a broad spectrum of flow and radiation transport regimes using the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS). The approach integrates an unstructured finite-volume discrete velocity method with a set of macroscopic synthetic equations. Within this framework, the kinetic model provides high-order closures for the constitutive relations in the synthetic equations. Simultaneously, the macroscopic synthetic equations drive the evolution of the mesoscopic kinetic system, significantly accelerating steady-state convergence in near-continuum regimes, as substantiated by linear Fourier stability analysis. Crucially, the algorithm is proven to be asymptotic-preserving, correctly recovering the continuum and optically thick limits, represented by the radiative Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations governing distinct translational, rotational, vibrational, and radiative temperatures, on coarse meshes independent of the mean free path. Numerical simulations of challenging benchmarks, including three-dimensional hypersonic flow over an Apollo reentry capsule, demonstrate that GSIS achieves orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional iterative schemes in multiscale simulations of radiative gas flows while accurately capturing non-equilibrium effects and radiative heat transfer in hypersonic environments.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04104v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) force fields enable large-scale simulations with near-first-principles accuracy at substantially reduced computational cost. Recent work has extended ML force-field approaches to adiabatic dynamical simulations of condensed-matter lattice models with coupled electronic and structural or magnetic degrees of freedom. However, most existing formulations rely on hand-crafted, symmetry-aware descriptors, whose construction is often system-specific and can hinder generality and transferability across different lattice Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a symmetry-preserving framework based on equivariant neural networks (ENNs) that provides a general, data-driven mapping from local configurations of dynamical variables to the associated on-site forces in a lattice Hamiltonian. In contrast to ENN architectures developed for molecular systems -- where continuous Euclidean symmetries dominate -- our approach aims to embed the discrete point-group and internal symmetries intrinsic to lattice models directly into the neural-network representation of the force field. As a proof of principle, we construct an ENN-based force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of the Holstein Hamiltonian on a square lattice, a canonical system for electron-lattice physics. The resulting ML-enabled large-scale dynamical simulations faithfully capture mesoscale evolution of the symmetry-breaking phase, illustrating the utility of lattice-equivariant architectures for linking microscopic electronic processes to emergent dynamical behavior in condensed-matter lattice systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03619v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Fitness consequence of dispersal depends on property of the entire landscape, which patches are available and what are the cost of moving. These are information that are not available locally when an organism make the decision to disperse. This poses a problem to the organism, where it is unclear how an adaptive decision can be made. This also poses a problem to the scientist, since in order to study the adaptiveness of dispersal, we need information of the entire landscape. For theorist, this is through making a series of assumption about either the landscape or the organism, and for empiricists, this means a large amount of measurements needs to be made across a large area. In this paper, we propose a link between local demographic process, which an organism can have access to, to the fitness consequence of dispersal. This meant local environmental cue can be used for the decision on dispersal, and hence allow the evolution of plastic dispersal strategy. We will then show that using this approach, evolution of dispersal on complex landscape can be modelled with relative ease, and to show that accidental dispersal in one patch can drive the evolution of adaptive dispersal in another.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03656v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Long-range interactions and electric response are essential for accurate modeling of condensed-phase systems, but capturing them efficiently remains a challenge for atomistic machine learning. Traditionally, these two phenomena can be represented by static charges, that participate in Coulomb interactions between atoms, and dynamic charges such as atomic polar tensors - aka Born effective charges - describing the response to an external electric field. We critically compare different approaches to learn both types of charges, taking bulk water and water clusters as paradigmatic examples: (1) Learning them independently; (2) Coupling static and dynamic charges based on their physical relationship with a single global coupling constant to account for dielectric screening; (3) Coupled learning with a local, environment-dependent screening factor. In the coupled case, correcting for dielectric screening is essential, yet the common assumption of homogeneous, isotropic screening breaks down in heterogeneous systems such as water clusters. A learned, environment-dependent screening restores high accuracy for the dynamical charges. However, the accuracy gain over independent dynamic predictions is negligible, while the computational cost increases compared to using separate models for static and dynamical charges. This suggests that, despite the formal connection between the two charge types, modeling them independently is the more practical choice for both condensed-phase and isolated cluster systems.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Control-theoretic design of amplitude/frequency-modulated impulsive feedback to stabilize periodic dosing cycles in nonlinear plants, demonstrated on closed-loop atracurium administration using patient-specific PK/PD models.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.22417v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The task of maintaining a predefined level of effect in a dynamical plant by applying periodic control actions often arises in e.g. process control and medicine. When the state variables of the plant represent the concentrations of chemical substances and the control action constitutes an instantaneous introduction of a certain quantity of a chemical or drug, this control setup is referred to as a (discrete) dosing problem. The present paper examines an amplitude- and frequency-modulated impulsive controller that, under stationary conditions, generates a desired sequence of uniform and equidistant control impulses based on continuous measurements of the output of a smooth positive nonlinear time-invariant single-input single-output plant with Wiener structure. The controller design method is based on constructing and stabilizing the fixed point of a discrete map that describes the evolution of the state vector of the continuous plant between successive impulsive control action instants. Stability of the fixed point ensures the existence of a basin of attraction along the stationary trajectory, where the solution of a perturbed closed-loop system converges to the stationary solution. The convergence rate is determined by the slopes of the amplitude and frequency modulation functions of the impulsive controller. The proposed controller is applied to the dosing of the drug \emph{atracurium} in closed-loop neuromuscular blockade, and its performance is evaluated on a database of patient-specific pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models estimated from clinical data. It is demonstrated that an implementation of the standard regimen as a pulse-modulated feedback controller significantly minimizes the incidence of underdosing events.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2308.08794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Tipping points are abrupt, drastic, and often irreversible changes in the evolution of non-stationary and chaotic dynamical systems. For instance, increased greenhouse gas concentrations are predicted to lead to drastic decreases in low cloud cover, referred to as a climatological tipping point. In this paper, we learn the evolution of such non-stationary dynamical systems using a novel recurrent neural operator (RNO), which learns mappings between function spaces. After training RNO on only the pre-tipping dynamics, we employ it to detect future tipping points using an uncertainty-based approach. In particular, we propose a conformal prediction framework to forecast tipping points by monitoring deviations from physics constraints (such as conserved quantities and partial differential equations), enabling forecasting of these abrupt changes along with a rigorous measure of uncertainty. We illustrate our proposed methodology on non-stationary ordinary and partial differential equations, such as the Lorenz-63 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations. We also apply our methods to forecast a climate tipping point in stratocumulus cloud cover and airfoil wake and stall transitions using only limited knowledge of the governing equations. For the latter, we show that our proposed method zero-shot generalizes to forecasting multiple future tipping points under varying Reynolds numbers. In our experiments, we demonstrate that even partial or approximate physics constraints can be used to accurately forecast future tipping points.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03930v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Phage display is a powerful laboratory technique used to study the interactions between proteins and other molecules, whether other proteins, peptides, DNA or RNA. The under-utilisation of this data in conjunction with deep learning models for protein design may be attributed to; high experimental noise levels; the complex nature of data pre-processing; and difficulty interpreting these experimental results. In this work, we propose a novel approach utilising a Bayesian Neural Network within a training loop, in order to simulate the phage display experiment and its associated noise. Our goal is to investigate how understanding the experimental noise and model uncertainty can enable the reliable application of such models to reliably interpret phage display experiments. We validate our approach using actual binding affinity measurements instead of relying solely on proxy values derived from &#x27;held-out&#x27; phage display rounds.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spreading epidemics can foster the rapid emergence of novel parasite variants. Similar to range expansions, parasites at the front of an epidemic wave may evolve traits facilitating their spatial spread. Typically, higher transmissibility and virulence are expected to evolve at the epidemic front, but predictions change if virulence reduces dispersal of infected hosts. We investigated the feedbacks between epidemiology and evolution in interconnected microcosms of the ciliate Paramecium caudatum and its bacterial parasite Holospora undulata. First, two long-term treatments mimicked the moving front of epidemic waves, with and without the natural dispersal of infected hosts. Phenotypic trait assays revealed an eco-to-evo feedback: wave-front parasites (i.e., travelling with infected hosts) were less virulent and interfered less with host dispersal, but also showed higher infectivity, compared to parasites from the control treatment. Whole-genome resequencing corroborated phenotypic divergence, but the genetic targets of selection remain unknown. Second, measurement of the spread of evolved parasites in linear landscapes demonstrated an evo-to-eco feedback: wave-front parasites produced stronger infection outbreaks and faster spreading epidemic waves than did evolution-control parasites. A simulation model assessed the relative importance of the different parasite traits in determining infectious spread over a broad parameter range. It suggests that, if dispersal is generally low, higher infectivity alone can produce the observed differences in epidemic spread speed. Our study illustrates how the need to travel with the host shapes eco-evolutionary feedbacks at parasite invasion fronts, and it highlights the importance of considering concomitant evolutionary change when predicting epidemic speed.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Antifolate resistance in P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase remains a major challenge for malaria control. To understand how this enzyme preserves function under antifolate selection, we developed PfPATH, a computational framework that integrates mutational fitness measurements, evolutionary interactions, and structural information to map plausible adaptive trajectories. PfPATH adaptive walks reveal that only a small subset of residues forms a constrained adaptive ridge that guides evolution. Most resistance mutations are harmful on their own and only become viable when supported by stabilizing changes. Hence, adaptation is confined to a few constrained pathways yielding high resistance. Structural network analyses indicate that these resistance mutations do not disrupt the overall enzyme architecture. Instead, they reorganize internal communication in a way that preserves catalytic function. We further showed through molecular dynamics and free-energy analyses that resistant variants remain structurally stable while exploring broader low-energy conformational substates. In conclusion, our work reveals a narrow and predictable route to antifolate escape, with implications for anticipating resistance evolution and guiding future drug design.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Author(s): N. Colantuono, M. Ramdan Ferressini, I. Zuriguel, D. R. Parisi, and G. A. Patterson Intermittency and clogging statistics have been extensively investigated in a variety of systems – from granular materials to pedestrian evacuations. Here, the authors experimentally study the evolution of mechanical pressure in a two-dimensional system of self-propelled agents flowing through a bottleneck, revealing a strong correlation between pressure dynamics and the system state (clogged vs unclogged). #ClearMotivation #SoftMatterSpotlight [Phys.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> A perspective piece arguing that long-term human–Mycobacterium tuberculosis co-evolution produces multiple immunological pathways to disease, and that systems-biology tools (e.g., single-cell/spatial transcriptomics) must model this complexity rather than seek a single mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tuberculosis is once again the most fatal global infectious disease and has killed many more humans than any other pathogen. Despite the identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) over 140 years ago, we have yet to control the epidemic. A central issue is the complexity of the host–pathogen interaction, with multiple underlying pathways leading to tuberculosis disease. This intricate relationship stems from the prolonged co-evolution of the pathogen with humans, resulting in diverse immunological processes leading to tuberculosis disease. Conversely, Mtb exposure may give a survival advantage through innate immune training, thereby providing selective pressure over millennia. Emerging methodologies, such as single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, offer a golden opportunity to understand the immunology unpinning this host–pathogen interaction at unprecedented resolution. However, these analyses will be fundamentally flawed if they do not consider the intricacies of human Mtb infection. Here, we propose that attempts to find single immunological mechanisms leading to tuberculosis are hindering progress, and we must embrace the complexity of multiple paths to disease to allow the systems biology era to deliver transformative solutions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces and benchmarks a machine-learning perturbation model (RAZOR) for charged Pt(111)–water interfaces, focusing on avoiding dielectric breakdown artifacts to accurately reproduce ab initio interfacial water structure and potential response under modest bias.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The recently introduced &quot;Response analysis in z-orientation&quot; (RAZOR) model utilizes perturbation theory to machine learn the energy and force response to applied bias charges in atomistic simulations of electrified interfaces. While we have shown that RAZOR successfully reproduces ab initio results for adsorbates on metallic surfaces in an implicit solvent environment, real electrochemical applications require the inclusion of at least a few explicit H2O layers of the electrolyte. Here, we benchmark RAZOR&#x27;s performance in the description of the Pt(111)-H2O interface. We show that RAZOR can reliably reproduce ab initio molecular dynamics findings for bias-induced changes in H2O density and orientation profiles as well as changes in the potential. To do so, a specific training procedure needs to be applied which avoids the erroneous learning of artifacts from the dielectric breakdown of interfacial water and the accompanying charge transfer into the H2O layers. Ultimately, we are confident that RAZOR can provide quantitative predictions in a +/- 20 muC/cm2 window around the neutral-charged cell, which is sufficient for many pressing electrochemical questions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Describes a window-free in-situ soft X-ray XPS/NEXAFS electrode assembly that enables real-time electronic/chemical characterization of hydrated electrocatalytic interfaces during water oxidation, a broadly useful method but not directly focused on origins-of-life chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In-situ soft X-ray spectroscopy provides direct insight into the electronic structure of electrocatalysts under realistic reaction conditions but remains technically challenging due to the need to combine aqueous electrochemistry with ultra-high-vacuum detection. Here we present a mesoporous carbon–membrane working electrode assembly (WEA) that enables window-free in-situ XPS and NEXAFS measurements during electrochemical reactions. The design integrates a Nafion™ proton-exchange membrane with a mesoporous carbon–ionomer contact layer and a thin IrOₓ catalyst layer, providing continuous electronic and protonic pathways and stable hydration through the membrane. By tuning the chamber water vapor pressure to 8 mbar, the WEA maintains a nanometer-thin water layer sufficient for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) while preserving photoelectron detection efficiency. A robust peristaltic pumping system and closed-loop alumina-bed water vapor dosing maintain steady-state hydration at 6–10 mbar with &lt;±0.1 mbar variation, enabling reproducible in-siut spectra over extended periods. In-situ Ir 4f and O 1s XPS reveal reversible oxidation of Ir³⁺/Ir⁴⁺ to Ir⁴⁺/Ir⁵⁺ and dynamic changes in hydroxyl and lattice oxygen species, while O K-edge NEXAFS identify the formation of μ₂–O and μ₁–O species at OER potential, corresponding to OER-active intermediates. The WEA thus provides a quantitative, window-free platform for probing electrochemical interfaces under near-ambient conditions and establishes a general methodology for in-situ soft X-ray studies of functional electrocatalysts, closely resembling the architecture and operation of industrial membrane-based water electrolysers. This approach establishes a reliable methodology for coupling electrochemistry with the element specific soft X-ray spectroscopy under realistic reaction conditions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> LORA is a Snakemake-based, reproducible long-read genome assembly pipeline integrating multiple assemblers and QC/reporting steps for bacterial and unicellular eukaryote datasets, offering general genomics utility but minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Genome assembly from long-read sequencing data has become a standard approach for resolving complex genomic regions and producing high-contiguity assemblies. However, the diversity of available assemblers, their varying performance across species, and the need for reproducible workflows present ongoing challenges. We developed LORA, an easy-to-use and reproducible application for assembling genomes from long-read data. LORA integrates several well-established assemblers, including Canu, HiFiasm, Flye, and Unicycler, as well as more recent tools such as Necat and Pecat. It is implemented as a Snakemake pipeline to parallelize tasks and support seamless execution on both local machines and computing clusters. LORA includes multiple quality assessment steps, interactive HTML reports for interpretation, BLAST-based taxonomic identification, and completeness evaluation. Together, these features provide users with a comprehensive view of assembly quality and potential problematic. We illustrate the capabilities of LORA using datasets from bacterial genomes and unicellular eukaryotes, sequenced with both PacBio and Oxford Nanopore technologies, highlighting typical outcomes and common pitfalls encountered during long-read assemblies. LORA is distributed as part of the Sequana project, an open-source framework designed for reproducibility, maintainability, and straightforward deployment across computing environments.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Operando X-ray diffraction reveals how oxygen-loss-driven surface reconstruction in Ni-rich layered oxide cathodes promotes heterogeneous bulk delithiation and accelerates capacity fade during high-voltage cycling.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The electrochemical performance of single-crystalline Ni-rich layered oxide cathodes is fundamentally limited by bulk Li⁺ diffusion within micrometre-sized particles. During high-voltage cycling—necessary for high-energy applications—intraparticle Li⁺ diffusion is further impeded by oxygen-loss-induced surface reconstruction from the layered phase to spinel/rock-salt structures. Therefore, to fully understand how bulk Li⁺ transport kinetics influences electrochemical degradation, it is necessary to establish the correlation between surface reconstruction and bulk delithiation during the anisotropic structural evolution (i.e., expansion of the layers followed by their contraction) of the cathode particles during long-term cycling. In this work, we accomplish this using multi-rate operando X-ray diffraction studies of single-crystalline Ni-rich layered oxide cathodes aged under different voltage windows in single-layer pouch full cells. We quantify how increased surface reconstruction leads to greater heterogeneity in bulk delithiation, thereby promoting phase separation and exacerbating electrochemical capacity fade. These results provide a direct mechanistic link between surface degradation and bulk delithiation in such cathodes and offer a framework for non-destructively probing kinetics-dependent degradation under practically relevant conditions to guide strategies for improved cycling stability.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Reports an MSI2–HOXA9 fusion as an oncogenic second hit in blast-crisis CML that increases mitochondrial gene expression and respiration, with limited direct relevance to origins-of-life questions beyond general RNA/mitochondrial biology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Myeloid leukemias, diseases marked by aggressiveness and poor outcomes, are frequently triggered by oncogenic translocations. In the case of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), the BCR-ABL fusion initiates chronic phase disease with second hits allowing progression to blast crisis. Although Gleevec has been transformative for CML, blast crisis CML remains relatively drug resistant. Here, we show that MSI2-HOXA9 , a translocation with an unknown role in cancer, can serve as a second hit in driving bcCML. Compared to BCR-ABL, BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 led to a more aggressive disease in vivo with decreased latency, increased lethality, and a differentiation blockade that is a hallmark of blast crisis. Domain mapping revealed that the MSI2 RNA binding domain RRM1 had a preferential impact on growth and lethality of bcCML relative to RRM2 or the HOXA9 domain. Mechanistically, MSI2-HOXA9 triggered global downstream changes with a preferential upregulation of mitochondrial components. Consistent with this, BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 cells exhibited a significant increase in mitochondrial respiration. These data suggest that MSI2-HOXA9 acts, at least in part, by increasing expression of the mitochondrial polymerase POLRMT and augmenting mitochondrial function and basal respiration in blast crisis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate for the first time that translocations involving the stem and developmental signal MSI2 can be oncogenic and suggest that MSI, which we found to be a frequent partner for an array of translocations, could also be a driver mutation across solid cancers.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Using single-cell and bulk transcriptomics, the study links intrinsic replication stress in luminal progenitors to ELF3 upregulation that mitigates genomic instability while promoting transformation in BRCA1-deficient breast tumorigenesis.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> BRCA1 is a critical tumor suppressor, mutations in which greatly increase risks for many tumors in carriers, most notably breast cancer. Luminal progenitor cells (LPs) are the currently recognized cells of origin of BRCA1-deficient breast cancers. However, the reason why LPs are prone to transform with BRCA1 deficiency has not been elucidated. Here, using single-cell sequencing of human BRCA1 mutant breast cancers and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of BRCA1 -deficient normal mammary cells, we reveal that replication stress is a feature of LPs and a driving factor during BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, replication stress and BRCA1 deficiency lead to significant upregulation of ELF3 expression. ELF3 can help suppress excessive genomic instability and promote LP transformation with BRCA1 deficiency. Moreover, ELF3 emerged as a core transcription factor regulating LP genes, leading to LP expansion. Our findings suggest that replication stress is a driving factor during BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis in luminal progenitor cells and elucidates the key role of ELF3 during this process.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Materials-chemistry preprint showing highly efficient chirality transfer from Δ/Λ metal complexes into nematic liquid crystals, offering a potential model system for studying chiral amplification and ordered-phase effects relevant (indirectly) to prebiotic homochirality.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nematic (N) liquid crystals (LCs), characterized by one-dimensional orientational order, readily transform into chiral nematic (N*) phases upon the incorporation of optically active substances, known as chiral dopants. While the ease of N* induction has driven the extensive development of organic chiral dopants, coordination compounds possessing Δ/Λ chirality have emerged as compelling alternatives, offering distinct structural and functional attributes. A defining feature of these &quot;metallodopants&quot; is their exceptionally high helical twisting power (HTP). For instance, early studies demonstrated that the simple complex Λ-[Ru(acac)3] exhibits a remarkably high HTP of 90 micrometer-1 in MBBA (N-(4-methoxybenzylidene)-4-butylaniline). This efficiency is attributed to the rigid coordination framework, which facilitates robust chirality transfer to the host LC. However, metallodopants often face challenges regarding miscibility with nematic hosts and intrinsic coloration, potentially complicating their integration into optical devices; consequently, systematic investigations have been limited compared to organic dopants. Nevertheless, metallodopants offer unique advantages. In tris(chelate) metal complexes, the sense of the induced helix (P or M) is strongly correlated with ligand orientation; for example, a 90° rotation of a ligand’s elongation axis can reverse the helical sense. This predictable inversion, supported by theoretical models, underscores the critical role of structural rigidity. Furthermore, the intrinsic absorption of these complexes, once viewed as a drawback, is now being harnessed for resonance Raman enhancement and chiroptical modulation. By combining high HTPs, predictable helix inversion, and spectroscopic utility, coordination compounds are positioning themselves as versatile competitors to organic dopants, serving as both functional inducers and optical probes for next-generation photonic and sensing technologies.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a DMS-MaPseq-based framework to quantify RNA hairpin structure and in-cell protein occupancy at single-nucleotide resolution, enabling effective affinity/occupancy estimates that predict functional outcomes (RNA decay) in human cells.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> RNA structures that form inside living cells influence processes ranging from translation to RNA decay, many of which are controlled by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Because RBP specificity depends on both local RNA structure and sequence motifs, traditional pulldown-based methods often obscure the structural context of bound RNAs. Here, a quantitative framework based on dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling and sequencing (DMS-MaPseq) is introduced that jointly measures RNA structure and protein binding at single-nucleotide resolution in human cells, enabling estimation of effective RNA-protein affinities and fractional occupancy directly in cells. Application of this approach to a 1,600-member library of MS2 hairpin mutants reveals that RNA folding is the strongest determinant of MS2 coat protein (MCP) recognition, and that stable MS2 structures must form for MCP to bind its target sequence. MCP also shows strong preference for its consensus loop sequence while displaying minimal dependence on stem length beyond ten base pairs or on stem GC content. Incorporation of an inducible degron fused to MCP allows precise tuning of intracellular protein concentrations analogous to those of many endogenous RBPs and show that DMS reactivity changes can be used to infer binding specificities across a subsaturating regime. A quantitative occupancy framework further shows that inferred fraction-bound values accurately predict how efficiently MCP fused to a downregulatory-domain drives RNA degradation. Together, these results establish a generalizable approach for measuring RBP-RNA affinities with structural resolution in living cells, dissecting how sequence and structure contribute to RBP recognition, and quantitatively linking occupancy to functional output.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study shows that piRNA/PIWI signaling in the ciliate Oxytricha guides N6-adenine DNA methylation (6mA) via MTA1 to mark and protect genomic regions from programmed deletion during nuclear development, illustrating an RNA-directed epigenetic mechanism for genome maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The ciliate Oxytricha undergoes massive genome rearrangements during development to produce a functional nucleus from an encrypted zygotic genome. PIWI-interacting small RNAs protect DNA regions against deletion, but how that protective mark is established has been a mystery. Recently our lab discovered MTA1, a methyltransferase that catalyzes DNA N6-adenine (6mA) methylation. Both MTA1 and the Oxytricha Piwi protein, Otiwi1, are required for development, and Otiwi1 mutation eliminates 6mA signal. To examine the role of 6mA, we analyzed its genome-wide distribution across development in wild-type and MTA1 mutant backcrossed cells. We find specific and abundant enrichment on retained sequences, suggesting a protective role for this epigenetic mark. Furthermore, programmed retention of a DNA region that is normally deleted leads to accumulation of new 6mA marks on the ectopically retained DNA sequence. Together, these results suggest that piRNA-guided 6mA DNA methylation leads to protection of DNA sequences against deletion during nuclear differentiation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> To evaluate the impact of wildfire on drinking water treatability, wildfire ash is often added to source water to reflect post-fire source water quality change. The use of varying experimental conditions has led to conflicting inferences across studies and inconsistent results, even between nominal replicates. Here, mixing time and ash concentration effects on wildfire ash-impacted water (WAIW) quality were investigated, and their impacts on leached water extractable organic matter (WEOM) from wildfire and prescribed fire ash were characterized at bench-scale. The effects of mixing time and ash-to-water ratios were investigated using both natural river water and ultrapure water. Notably, WEOM concentration and character varied considerably within the first 24 hours of mixing, and water type and ash mass concentration limit the leaching of WEOM into water. These results highlight the critical role of careful experimental design and well-justified approaches to support meaningful interpretation and comparability across studies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> High-entropy oxides offer a promising platform for oxygen evolution reaction catalysis owing to their entropy-stabilized structures and flexible design of cation metal elements. However, conventional high-temperature synthesis leads to extensive particle growth and limits access to nanoscale particles with higher density of catalytic sites. Here, a subcritical hydrothermal synthesis combined with catechol-assisted growth regulation is introduced to produce high-entropy single-phase spinel oxide nanoparticles with controlled crystallite sizes down to the single-nanometer scale. The resulting reduction in particle size markedly enhances the oxygen evolution activity. A linear dependence of the oxygen evolution current density on the inverse crystallite size highlights the critical role of nanoscale structures in accelerating catalytic reactions. In-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals electronic and structural robustness of all constituent metal elements under OER conditions, with negligible shifts in oxidation state or changes in local coordination structure, which is distinct from the pronounced reconstruction typically observed in conventional oxide catalysts. When deployed in a membrane electrode assembly, our synthesized high-entropy oxide catalysts with the smallest particle size deliver 2.0 A cm-2 at 1.96 V, demonstrating practical relevance for high-current-density electrolysis. This work establishes low-temperature hydrothermal synthesis with organic molecular regulation as a powerful and scalable route to engineer highly crystalline, compositionally homogeneous high-entropy oxide nanoparticles, offering design guidelines for next-generation oxygen evolution reaction catalysts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> To evaluate the impact of wildfire on drinking water treatability, wildfire ash is often added to source water to reflect post-fire source water quality change. The use of varying experimental conditions has led to conflicting inferences across studies and inconsistent results, even between nominal replicates. Here, mixing time and ash concentration effects on wildfire ash-impacted water (WAIW) quality were investigated, and their impacts on leached water extractable organic matter (WEOM) from wildfire and prescribed fire ash were characterized at bench-scale. The effects of mixing time and ash-to-water ratios were investigated using both natural river water and ultrapure water. Notably, WEOM concentration and character varied considerably within the first 24 hours of mixing, and water type and ash mass concentration limit the leaching of WEOM into water. These results highlight the critical role of careful experimental design and well-justified approaches to support meaningful interpretation and comparability across studies.</p>

In quantum optics a central objective is to determine the time evolution of a given initial state. Exact analytic solution to the state-evolution problem is presented, applicable to a broad class of solvable bosonic models and arbitrary initial states. Moreover, the characteristic equation governing the energy spectrum is derived and the eigenstates are found in the form of continued fractions and as the principal minors of the associated Jacobi matrix. The results provide a solid analytical framework for discussion of exactly solvable bosonic models.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02621v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Stellar photospheric heterogeneities (e.g., starspots, faculae) distort the stellar spectrum in transit and imprint wavelength-dependent biases on the planet-to-star radius ratio (Transit Light Source Effect, TLSE). The Rackham-TLSE (R-TLSE) prescription applies a disc-averaged correction based solely on filling factor and spectral contrast, but transmission spectroscopy also depends on limb darkening, active-region distribution, and transit geometry. We include these in a pixel-resolved framework, ECLIPSE-Xlambda, and run idealised noise-free model-model comparisons to R-TLSE. For LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, and WASP-69 b, disc-averaged corrections differ from the pixel model by up to about 400 ppm in the optical for active hosts and non-equatorial transits, but stay below about 10 ppm in the near-infrared where limb darkening is weak. We then apply both approaches to the JWST/NIRISS SOSS spectrum of LHS 1140 b. With limb darkening set to zero, ECLIPSE-Xlambda recovers stellar-contamination parameters matching the reference R-TLSE solution, confirming consistency in the disc-averaged limit. With wavelength-dependent limb darkening, reproducing the short-wavelength slope via stellar contamination alone requires hot faculae (delta Tfac about 600 K; ffac about 0.35), equivalent to a circular facular region of radius about 0.6 Rstar (about 60% of the stellar radius) on the disc; such an extended unocculted region is physically unlikely even for an active M dwarf. Purely stellar contamination would therefore require extreme faculae, whereas a genuine atmospheric contribution complementing a more modest facular signal is more plausible. These results delineate the validity regime of R-TLSE and underscore the need for geometry-aware stellar-heterogeneity models including limb darkening in high-precision transmission spectroscopy.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02548v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The rise of oxygen in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere during the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) occurred about 2.3 billion years ago. There is considerably greater uncertainty for the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis, but it likely occurred significantly earlier, perhaps by 700 million years. Assuming this time lag is proportional to the rate of oxygen generation, we can estimate how long it would take for a GOE-like event to occur on a hypothetical Earth-analog planet orbiting the star TRAPPIST-1 (a late M star with Teff 2560 K). Although in the habitable zone, an Earth-analog planet located in TRAPPIST-1e&#x27;s orbit would receive only 0.9% of the Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) that the Earth gets from the Sun. This is because most of the star&#x27;s light is emitted at wavelengths longer than the 400-700 nm PAR range. Thus it would take 63 Gyrs for a GOE to occur. But the linear assumption is problematic; as light levels increase, photosynthesis saturates then declines, an effect known as photoinhibition. Photoinhibition varies from species to species and depends on a host of environmental factors. There is also sensitivity to the upper wavelength limit of the PAR: extending just 50 nm increases the number of photons by a factor of 2.5. Including these and other factors greatly reduces the timescale to roughly 1-5 Gyrs for a GOE. However, non-oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria can thrive in low-light environments and can use near-IR light out to 1100 nm, providing 22 times as many photons. With this huge light advantage, and because they evolved earlier, anoxygenic photosynthesizers would likely dominate the ecosystem. On a late M-star Earth-analog planet, oxygen may never reach significant levels in the atmosphere and a GOE may never occur, let alone a Cambrian Explosion. Thus complex animal life is unlikely.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02545v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Pebble drift is an important mechanism for supplying the materials needed to build planets in the inner region of protoplanetary disks. Thus, constraining pebble drift&#x27;s timescales and mass flux is essential to understanding planet formation history. Current pebble drift models suggest pebble fluxes can be constrained from the enhancement of gaseous volatile abundances when icy pebbles sublimate after drifting across key snowlines. In this work, we present ALMA observations of spatially resolved $^{13}$C$^{18}$O J=2-1 line emission inside the midplane CO snowline of the HD 163296 and MWC 480 protoplanetary disks. We use radiative transfer and thermochemical models to constrain the spatial distribution of CO gas column density. We find that both disks display centrally peaked CO abundance enhancement of up to ten times of ISM abundance levels. For HD 163296 and MWC 480, the inferred enhancements require 250-350 and 480-660 Earth Masses of pebbles to have drifted across their CO snowlines, respectively. These ranges fall within cumulative pebble mass flux ranges to grow gas giants in the interior to the CO snowline. The centrally peaked CO enhancement is unexpected in current pebble drift models, which predict CO enhancement peaks at the CO snowline or is uniform inside the snowline. We propose two hypotheses to explain the centrally-peaked CO enhancement, including a large CO desorption distance and CO trapped in water ice. By testing both hypotheses with the 1D gas and dust evolution code chemcomp, we find that volatile trapping (about 30\%) best reproduces the centrally peaked CO enhancement observed.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02556v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The Lazuli Space Observatory is a 3-meter aperture astronomical facility designed for rapid-response observations and precision astrophysics across visible to near-infrared wavelengths (400-1700 nm bandpass). An off-axis, freeform telescope delivers diffraction-limited image quality (Strehl $&gt;$0.8 at 633 nm) to three instruments across a wide, flat focal plane. The three instruments provide complementary capabilities: a Wide-field Context Camera (WCC) delivers multi-band imaging over a 35&#x27; $\times$ 12&#x27; footprint with high-cadence photometry; an Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) provides continuous 400-1700 nm spectroscopy at R $\sim$ 100-500 for stable spectrophotometry; and an ExtraSolar Coronagraph (ESC) enables high-contrast imaging expected to reach raw contrasts of $10^{-8}$ and post-processed contrasts approaching $10^{-9}$. Operating from a 3:1 lunar-resonant orbit, Lazuli will respond to targets of opportunity in under four hours--a programmatic requirement designed to enable routine temporal responsiveness that is unprecedented for a space telescope of this size. Lazuli&#x27;s technical capabilities are shaped around three broad science areas: (1) time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, (2) stars and planets, and (3) cosmology. These capabilities enable a potent mix of science spanning gravitational wave counterpart characterization, fast-evolving transients, Type Ia supernova cosmology, high-contrast exoplanet imaging, and spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres. While these areas guide the observatory design, Lazuli is conceived as a general-purpose facility capable of supporting a wide range of astrophysical investigations, with open time for the global community. We describe the observatory architecture and capabilities in the preliminary design phase, with science operations anticipated following a rapid development cycle from concept to launch.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02665v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We report the discovery of a sub-Neptune and a Neptune-like planet ($R_b = 2.48^{+0.14}_{-0.10}\,R_\oplus$, $R_c = 4.03^{+0.23}_{-0.15}\,R_\oplus$) orbiting the F-type star TOI-4495. The planets have orbital periods of 2.567 days and 5.185 days, lying close to a 2:1 mean-motion resonance (MMR). Our photodynamical analysis of the TESS light curves constrains the planetary masses to $M_b = 7.7 \pm 1.4\,M_\oplus$ and $M_c = 23.2 \pm 4.7\,M_\oplus$. The measured masses and radii indicate the presence of volatile-rich gaseous envelopes on both planets. The Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and the Doppler shadow of TOI-4495 c reveal a well-aligned orbit with a projected stellar obliquity of $\lambda = -2.3^{+8.3}_{-7.8}\,\mathrm{deg}$. Combined with the low mutual inclination constrained by the photodynamical analysis ($\Delta I &lt; 8.7\,\mathrm{deg}$), the planetary orbits are likely coplanar and aligned with the host star&#x27;s spin axis. We show that the planets are near, but not in, the 2:1 MMR, with a circulating resonant angle. We also find substantial free eccentricity for the inner planet, TOI-4495 b ($e_b = 0.078^{+0.020}_{-0.013}$). Given the observed proximity to the 2:1 resonance and the more massive outer planet, TOI-4495 b and c are particularly susceptible to resonant overstability, which can convert resonantly excited eccentricity into free eccentricity. However, additional mechanisms (e.g., planetesimal scattering) may be required to further excite the eccentricity by $\sim 4\%$. To prevent tidal damping from reducing the eccentricity below the observed level over the star&#x27;s lifetime (1.9 Gyr), the reduced tidal quality factor of TOI-4495 b must be $Q&#x27; \gtrsim 10^5$, consistent with the presence of a thick envelope on the planet.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02479v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Planet formation is inherently linked to protoplanetary disc evolution, which recent developments suggest is driven by magnetised winds rather than turbulent viscosity. We study planet formation in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind-driven discs, assuming accretion occurs in a laminar surface layer above a weakly turbulent midplane. Our goal is to assess the global consequences of recent hydrodynamical results, including inefficient midplane heating and the existence of two Type II migration regimes: slow viscosity-dominated and fast wind-driven migration. We perform single-embryo planetary population syntheses with varying initial disc conditions (i.e. disc mass, size and angular momentum transport), and embryo starting locations, testing different prescriptions for the accretion layer thickness $\Sigma_\text{active}$. Thin ($\lesssim0.01\mathrm{g\,cm^{-2}}$) or fast ($\gtrsim12\%$ sonic velocity) accretion layers result in slow, viscosity-dominated regime which strongly limits the extent of Type II migration. For thick ($\gtrsim1\mathrm{g\,cm^{-2}}$) or slow ($\lesssim3\%$ sonic velocity) accretion layers, fast wind-driven Type II migration occurs frequently, leading to long-range inward migration that sets in once planets reach masses sufficient to block the accreting layer. Disk-limited gas accretion is also strongly affected by deep and early gap opening, limiting maximum giant planet masses. These effects strongly influence the final mass-distance distribution. For thin layers, giant planets form nearly in situ once they have entered Type II migration, which happens already at a few Earth masses, while thick layers lead to numerous migrated Hot Jupiters. Overall, we find that while the global properties of the emerging planet population are strongly modified relative to classical viscous discs, key properties of the observed population can be reproduced within this new paradigm.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> ALMA measurements of rare CO isotopologues in the HD 163296 protoplanetary disk constrain C and O isotopic ratios in an optically thin region beyond the CO snowline, informing volatile inheritance and chemical evolution in planet-forming environments.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02593v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Isotopic abundance ratios in protoplanetary disks are critical for understanding volatile inheritance and chemical evolution in planet-forming environments. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the rare isotopologue 13C18O(2-1) at approximately 0.3 arcsec resolution from the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296, combined with archival observations of C17O(2-1), C18O(1-0), and C17O(1-0), to empirically constrain carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios without detailed disk modeling. Both the C17O/13C18O(2-1) and C18O/C17O(1-0) flux ratios rise sharply across the CO snowline and flatten beyond 1.5 arcsec (r &gt;= 150 au), where the emission becomes optically thin. This transition, reflecting a steep drop in CO column density set by the disk&#x27;s thermal structure, makes HD 163296 an optimal case for isotopic analysis. Using beam-averaged intensities of the four transitions measured in this optically thin region, we derive isotopic ratios of 12C/13C = 75.3 (+14.7/-11.4) and 18O/17O = 3.28 (+0.31/-0.26), both consistent with local interstellar medium values. The 16O/18O ratio remains weakly constrained due to moderate optical depth in the C18O(1-0) line and degeneracy with CO column density. These results demonstrate that rare CO isotopologues can provide robust, empirical constraints on isotopic ratios in disks when sharp structural transitions allow for the identification of optically thin regions, and establish HD 163296 as a benchmark for extending such studies to other systems with resolved snowline structures.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2505.08863v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Debris disks are exoplanetary systems that contain planets, minor bodies (i.e., asteroids, Kuiper belt objects, comets, etc.), and micron-sized debris dust. Since water ice is the most common frozen volatile, it plays an essential role in the formation of planets and minor bodies. Although water ice has been commonly found in Kuiper belt objects and comets in the Solar System, no definitive evidence for water ice in debris disks has been obtained to date. Here, we report the discovery of water ice in the HD 181327 disk using the James Webb Space Telescope Near-Infrared Spectrograph. We detect the solid-state broad absorption feature of water ice at 3 $\mu$m and a distinct Fresnel peak feature at 3.1 $\mu$m, a characteristic of large water-ice particles. This implies the presence of a water-ice reservoir in the HD 181327 exoKuiper belt. Gradients of water-ice features at different stellocentric distances reveal a dynamic process of destroying and replenishing water ice in the disk, with estimated water-ice mass fractions ranging from 0.1% at ~85 au to 14% at ~113 au. It is highly plausible that the icy bodies that release water ice in HD 181327 could be the extra-solar counterparts of some of the Kuiper belt objects in our Solar System, supported by their spectral similarity.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Modeling how dust traps and disc turbulence control pebble retention and volatile delivery in protoplanetary discs, yielding observational predictions (mm continuum morphologies) that constrain planet-forming environments relevant to prebiotic material transport.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02486v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This manuscript investigates the impact of key dust evolution parameters on dust retention and trapping in protoplanetary discs. Using models with and without pressure bumps, combined with radiative transfer simulations, images of the dust continuum emission at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths, their fluxes and observed disc sizes are presented. For discs without pressure bumps (smooth discs), significant dust mass can only be retained over Myr timescales when dust fragmentation velocities are low (1m/s) and with viscosity values of $\alpha=10^{-3}$. For such a combination of fragmentation velocity and viscosity, the synthetic images show a bright inner emission follow by a shallow emission with potential gaps if they are present in the gas profile as well. At higher fragmentation velocities (5-10m/s), most dust is lost due to radial drift at million-year timescales unless pressure traps are present, in which case dust masses can increase by orders of magnitude and structures are observed in synthetic images. The viscosity parameter strongly shapes observable features, with low $\alpha$ producing sharper, potentially asymmetric inner wall cavities in inclined discs due to optically thick emission. High $\alpha$ favors the appearance of shoulders around the predominant rings that dust trapping produces. However, distinguishing between different fragmentation velocities observationally remains challenging. The inferred dust disc sizes from synthetic observations do not always correspond directly to dust model sizes or to the location of pressure bumps. Finally, we discuss implications for pebble fluxes and the delivery of volatiles to the inner disc. These results emphasize the strong degeneracies among dust evolution parameters and highlight the need for multi-wavelength, high-resolution observations to disentangle the processes shaping the formation of planets in protoplanetary discs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02407v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Standard simulations of the Iterated Prisoners Dilemma (IPD) operate in deterministic, noise-free environments, producing strategies that may be theoretically optimal but fragile when confronted with real-world uncertainty. This paper addresses two critical gaps in evolutionary game theory research: (1) the absence of realistic environmental stressors during strategy evolution, and (2) the Interpretability Gap, where evolved genetic strategies remain opaque binary sequences devoid of semantic meaning. We introduce a novel framework combining stochastic environmental perturbations (God Mode) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based behavioral profiling to transform evolved genotypes into interpretable character archetypes. Our experiments demonstrate that strategies evolved under chaotic conditions exhibit superior resilience and present distinct behavioral phenotypes, ranging from Ruthless Capitalists to Diplomatic Enforcers. These phenotypes are readily classified by LLMs but remain nearly impossible to interpret through manual genome inspection alone.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2506.22537v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The increasing number of detailed exoplanet observations offers an opportunity to refine our analyses and interpretations. Here, we show that atmospheres that appear volatile-rich and/or cloudy may instead be helium-rich. As transmission spectra constrain the atmospheric scale height ($H$), a He-enriched atmosphere can be misinterpreted as H$_2$-dominated water-rich to bring the mean molecular weight ($\mu$) to intermediate values ($\sim$4$-$10) when He/H$_2$ is fixed. Similarly, a cloud deck can reduce the spectral features, and thus the apparent (i.e., cloud-free equivalent) $H$. We present a proof-of-concept reanalysis of HD~209458~b&#x27;s JWST transmission spectrum treating He/H$_2$ as a free parameter, resulting in sets of He-rich solutions. We argue that He enhancement must be considered to reliably constrain atmospheric composition, be sensitive to a more diverse planetary population, and ultimately yield robust trends to inform formation and evolution pathways. Looking ahead, we suggest leveraging insights from differences in pressure-broadening effects, outflow measurements, and atmospheric chemistry to disentangle reliably between He-, volatile-rich, and cloudy atmospheres -- while recognizing that associated models need targeted upgrades to reach the fidelity level required to this end.</p>

We show that all these features can emerge from a minimal athermal two-dimensional model where particles interact isotropically by a double-well potential, which includes an excluded volume and a maximum coordination number.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02539v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: While fluids near a solid surface are at the core of applications in energy storage/conversion, electrochemistry/electrowetting and adsorption/catalysis, their nanoscale behavior remains only partially deciphered. Beyond conventional effects (e.g. adsorption/reaction, interfacial transport, phase transition shifts), recent experimental and theoretical studies on metallic surfaces have unraveled exotic peculiarities such as complex electrostatic screening, unexpected wetting transition, and interfacial quantum friction. These novel features require developing and embarking new tools to tackle the coupling between charge relaxation in the metal and molecular behavior in the vicinal fluid. Here, using the concept of Virtual Thomas-Fermi fluids, we employ a molecular simulation approach to investigate interfacial transport of fluid molecules and metal charge carriers at their interface--including the underlying electrostatically-driven dynamic friction and the coupling between charge current/hydrodynamic flow (the so-called electrohydrodynamic drag). While conventional numerical techniques consider either insulating materials or metallic materials described as polarizable, non-conducting media, our atom-scale strategy provides an effective yet realistic description of the solid excitation spectrum--including charge relaxation modes and conductivity. By applying this approach to water near metallic surfaces of various electrostatic screening lengths, we unveil a non-monotonous dependence of the fluid/solid friction on the metallicity with a maximum occurring as the charge dynamic structure factors of the solid and fluid strongly overlap. Moreover, we report a direct observation of the electrohydrodynamic drag which arises from the momentum transfer between the solid and liquid through dynamic electrostatic interactions and the underlying interfacial friction.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02699v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Heat dissipation is ubiquitous in living systems, which constantly convert distinct forms of energy into each other. The transport of thermal energy in liquids and even within proteins is well understood but kinetic energy transfer across a heterogeneous molecular boundary provides additional challenges. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations under steady-state conditions to analyze how a protein dissipates surplus thermal energy into the surrounding solvent. We specifically focus on collective degrees of freedom that govern the dynamics of the system from the diffusive regime to mid-infrared frequencies. Using a fully anharmonic analysis of molecular vibrations, we analyzed their vibrational spectra, temperatures, and heat transport efficiencies. We find that the most efficient energy transfer mechanisms are associated with solvent-mediated friction. However, this mechanism only applies to a small number of degrees of freedom of a protein. Instead, less efficient vibrational energy transfer in the far-infrared dominates heat transfer overall due to a large number of vibrations in this frequency range. A notable by-product of this work is a highly sensitive measure of deviations from energy equi-partition in equilibrium systems, which can be used to analyze non-ergodic properties.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2504.00210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Stochastic quantum trajectories, such as pure state evolutions under unitary dynamics and random measurements, offer a crucial ensemble description of many-body open system dynamics. Recent studies have highlighted that individual quantum trajectories also encode essential physical information. Prominent examples include measurement induced phase transitions, where a pure quantum state corresponding to fixed measurement outcomes (trajectories) exhibits distinct entanglement phases, depending on the measurement rate. However, direct observation of this effect is hindered by an exponential post-selection barrier, whereby the probability of realizing a specific trajectory is exponentially small. We propose a deterministic method to efficiently prepare quantum trajectories in polynomial time using imaginary time evolution and, thus, overcome this fundamental challenge. We demonstrate that our method applies to a certain class of quantum states, and argue that there does not exist universal approaches for any quantum trajectories. Our result paves the way for experimentally exploring the physics of individual quantum trajectories at scale and enables direct observation of certain post-selection-dependent phenomena.</p>

In a recent article, the first two authors of the present paper introduced partially cosymplectic structures as a geometric framework for thermodynamic systems, recovering the evolution equations obtained variationally. In this paper, we develop a discrete variational principle for adiabatically closed simple thermodynamic systems, which can be utilised to construct numerical integrators for the dynamics of such systems.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02539v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: While fluids near a solid surface are at the core of applications in energy storage/conversion, electrochemistry/electrowetting and adsorption/catalysis, their nanoscale behavior remains only partially deciphered. Beyond conventional effects (e.g. adsorption/reaction, interfacial transport, phase transition shifts), recent experimental and theoretical studies on metallic surfaces have unraveled exotic peculiarities such as complex electrostatic screening, unexpected wetting transition, and interfacial quantum friction. These novel features require developing and embarking new tools to tackle the coupling between charge relaxation in the metal and molecular behavior in the vicinal fluid. Here, using the concept of Virtual Thomas-Fermi fluids, we employ a molecular simulation approach to investigate interfacial transport of fluid molecules and metal charge carriers at their interface--including the underlying electrostatically-driven dynamic friction and the coupling between charge current/hydrodynamic flow (the so-called electrohydrodynamic drag). While conventional numerical techniques consider either insulating materials or metallic materials described as polarizable, non-conducting media, our atom-scale strategy provides an effective yet realistic description of the solid excitation spectrum--including charge relaxation modes and conductivity. By applying this approach to water near metallic surfaces of various electrostatic screening lengths, we unveil a non-monotonous dependence of the fluid/solid friction on the metallicity with a maximum occurring as the charge dynamic structure factors of the solid and fluid strongly overlap. Moreover, we report a direct observation of the electrohydrodynamic drag which arises from the momentum transfer between the solid and liquid through dynamic electrostatic interactions and the underlying interfacial friction.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding and establishing design principles to tune the excited states of earth-abundant sensitizers is crucial for identifying new photosensitizers for sustainable technological advancements. Here, we report a series of three bis Zr (IV) complexes of tridentate, dianionic ligands incorporating two phenoxide donors and aza arene acceptors of increasing electron affinity (pyridine &lt; pyrimidine &lt; pyrazine ) that are air and water-stable. These complexes emit via thermally assisted delayed fluorescence from an intraligand charge transfer excited state with varying metal contributions. The electronic structural changes from different acceptors vary the excited state character and the photophysical properties significantly between the complexes. The variation in photophysics that includes emission lifetime (76 μs to 265 ns), intersystem crossing (ISC) lifetime ( 390 – 290 ps), and the energy difference between the singlet and triplet excited states (∆EST. 170 -100 meV). We observe solvent-independent ISC rates when the excited state has metal contributions (acceptor = pyridine), and the ISC rates vary significantly with solvent polarity when the excited state is an intra-ligand charge transfer state (acceptor = pyrimidine and pyrazine). Transient absorption measurements provided the basis spectra and verified the metal contribution in the excited state. This work provides a basis for developing new sensitizers based on Zr (IV) by providing design principles that can be used to modulate the character of the excited state and its photophysics.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The axial ligand of heme is a key determinant of reactivity in heme-dependent enzymes, yet its systematic engineering remains challenging due to the limited chemical diversity of natural amino acids. Here, we demonstrate that replacing the native histidine axial ligand with a non-natural analog provides an effective strategy to regulate heme enzyme activity. By site-specifically incorporating δVin-H into APEX2, we reprogrammed the electronic structure of the heme center and unlocked catalytic activity toward aromatic amine substrates. Directed evolution of the APEX2-VinH enzyme yielded APEX3-VinH, which exhibits a pronounced enhancement in catalytic efficiency and robustness for aromatic amine oxidation. Notably, optimization of the δVin-H synthetase enabled highly efficient incorporation. This work establishes axial ligand engineering via genetic code expansion as a general and powerful strategy to reprogram the catalytic repertoire of heme enzymes, with broad implications for biocatalysis and the development of next-generation proximality labeling tools.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Uses JWST flare observations to explain why TRAPPIST-1’s white-light flares are unusually cool, informing assessments of the system’s radiation environment and potential habitability impacts rather than directly addressing origins-of-life chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Early JWST observations of TRAPPIST-1 have revealed an unexpected puzzle: energetic white-light flares (E&gt;1030 erg) reach temperatures of only ∼3500–4000,K, nearly three times cooler than typical solar flares, which peak around 9000–10000,K. Here we explain this difference by identifying the physical mechanism that regulates flare temperatures on late M-dwarfs.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A pigment that makes feathers and hair orange helps prevent cellular damage by removing excess cysteine from cells. Pheomelanin is an orange-to-red pigment that is built with the amino acid cysteine and found in human red hair and fair skin, as well as in bird feathers. Previous research has shown that pheomelanin is associated with increased melanoma risk, raising questions about why evolution has maintained genetic variants that promote pheomelanin production.</p>
