<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> In replicated selection experiments, fatty-acid vesicle populations show an increased turbidity phenotype consistent with emergent cooperative, inheritance-like dynamics during growth/division—supporting the plausibility of pre-genetic (protocell) evolution in prebiotic chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Adaptive evolution has long been hypothesized to be possible in the absence of genetic molecules, but experimental evidence remains lacking. Fatty acid vesicles represent an intriguing model to study the emergence of prebiotic evolution, since they can spontaneously grow and divide and have been hypothesized to be capable of non-genetic inheritance. In this study we conducted multiple experiments to test whether vesicle populations can respond to artificial selection for greater turbidity and, if so, whether that response can be tied to an inheritance-like mechanism. We prepared 96 independent vesicle populations, incubated them for 24 hours and then selected half the populations to propagate into the next generation. The populations to propagate were picked either randomly ,representing drift controls, or were the populations with the greatest turbidity, representing selection. Population propagation involved resuspension, transfer into fresh buffer, feeding with an amphiphile stock, and then incubating for the next 24 hours. In three replicate experiments run for at least 10 generations, we observed consistently greater turbidity in selection lineages compared to drift, as well as a reduction in the heritability (i.e., the correlation between parent and offspring turbidities). We conducted additional experiments to evaluate whether this response to selection is caused by a simple carryover effect or reflects cooperative dynamics, where vesicles from the parental generation affect newly formed vesicles in the offspring generation. The response to selection is much lower if we omitted the resuspension step and/or if we did not feed transfers with amphiphiles but instead mixed them we pre-formed vesicles. Combined with imaging and other analyses of the resuspension and feeding process, these results suggest that cooperative vesicle dynamics occur, where a small number of intact vesicles from a parental generation alters the dynamics of new vesicle formation following food addition. Overall, this study represents the first experimental finding of a response to artificial selection in prebiotic chemistry.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Review of how hydrogen-bonding networks in transition-metal water-oxidation catalysts tune proton transfer, stability, and electronic structure, offering broadly relevant insights into aqueous redox catalysis but only indirect relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Rising energy needs, the threat of climate change, and the diminishing reserves of non-renewable energy underscore the urgency for advancing alternative, sustainable, clean energy sources. Hydrogen is currently appraised as a logical, sustainable power source, with electrochemical water splitting emerging as a critical method for its production. Water oxidation, a key step in artificial photosynthesis, remains a significant challenge in the development of sustainable energy systems. Transition metal complexes have emerged as promising catalysts for this reaction due to their tunable structures and remarkable catalytic properties. Among the various factors influencing their performance, hydrogen bonding has gained increasing attention as a critical element in shaping catalytic efficiency and reaction pathways. The review explores the multifaceted role of hydrogen bonding in transition metal-based water oxidation catalysts, highlighting its impact on structural stability, proton transfer dynamics, and electronic modulation of active sites. We discuss recent advancements in understanding how hydrogen-bonding interactions influence catalytic activity and selectivity, drawing on both experimental findings and computational insights. By shedding light on the pivotal role of hydrogen bonding, this review aims to inspire innovative approaches for designing next-generation catalysts for sustainable water-splitting technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) is a promising valorisation route to upgrade the biodiesel by-product while co-producing green hydrogen at the cathode in electrolysers. However, the working mechanism of transition-metal-based catalysts such as Ni(OH)₂ remains poorly understood. Here, we employed a multi-operando spectroelectrochemical approach combining UV–Vis optical spectroscopy, soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and time-resolved stepped-potential spectroscopy to investigate the active oxidising species and charge-transfer dynamics under OER and GOR conditions. We identified the NiOOH (Ni3+) as the active species for GOR, whereas the formation of higher valent NiOO (Ni4+) species is completely suppressed in the presence of glycerol. The accumulation of surface adsorbed glycerol molecules is rate-determining, (τ ~ 27.9 s at 1.47 VRHE), occuring slower than the intrinsic catalytic step of glycerol reaction ( τ ~ 3.2 s at 1.47 VRHE), which involves oxidation and bond cleavage. In contrast, OER has significantly slower kinetics (τ ~167 s at 1.47 VRHE), resulting in the dominance of GOR and suppresion of oxygen evolution in the presence of glycerol. The potential-independent production of formic acid during GOR follows an apparent first-order dependence on NiOOH concentration, suggesting continuous C-C bond cleavage activated by reactive *O species. These findings link oxidising species with charge-transfer dynamics, providing insight for the rational design of Ni-based catalysts for glycerol and other biomass-derived molecule oxidations.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> In-situ TEM reveals multistep humidity-driven swelling, deliquescence, and drying-induced salt formation in mixed phthalic acid/NaCl aerosols, improving mechanistic understanding of aerosol water uptake with only indirect relevance to origins-of-life via planetary climate/chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Atmospheric aerosol water uptake properties influence cloud formation and precipitation, atmospheric chemistry, and global climate. Atmospheric aerosols often contain organic acids and inorganic hygroscopic salts, and their internal mixing influences water uptake properties in complex and non-intuitive ways. The heterogeneous nature of aerosol ensembles necessitates nanoscale visualization of aerosol mixing state and water uptake dynamics to uncover mechanistic details. Here we demonstrate that water uptake in phthalic acid (PTA)/sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosols proceeds by PTA swelling, NaCl deliquescence, and droplet growth, while subsequent drying creates core-shell particles containing newly formed sodium phthalate salts. Lab-made individual PTA/NaCl aerosols consisted of cuboidal crystalline NaCl domains phase separated from amorphous PTA domains. Sodium ions were observed in both NaCl and PTA domains, which were separated by a ~10 nm thick interphase with distinct composition and structure. Humidity controlled in-situ TEM imaging revealed PTA/NaCl aerosols initially uptake water by adsorption and swelling of the PTA. Further increases in humidity cause NaCl deliquescence, hygroscopic droplet growth, and partial dissolution and morphology changes in the PTA. Dehumidification initially causes precipitation of an organic-rich shell followed by a polycrystalline NaCl core, yielding a distinctly different core-shell morphology compared to the as-made particles. Diffraction and elemental mapping confirm crystalline sodium acid phthalate forms following dehumidification. This work solidifies our understanding of water uptake and chemical reactions in mixed organic-inorganic atmospheric aerosols by uncovering multistep water uptake dynamics and new phase formation.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Engineering study proposing a zeolite adsorption/desorption thermal energy storage system to convert industrial low-grade waste heat into data center cooling, reducing electricity use substantially while modestly increasing net water consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Data centers (DCs) represent a rapidly growing segment of electricity demand, with a substantial share of their consumption attributed to cooling needs. We propose a zeolite-based thermal energy storage (TES) system that harnesses low-grade waste heat (&lt;200 °C) from nearby industrial facilities to provide cooling for DCs. The system operates through spatially and temporally decoupled adsorption (discharging) and desorption (charging) steps: (a) industrial waste heat drives zeolite desorption, and (b) DC heat rejection facilitates water evaporation, enabling zeolite adsorption. Computational modeling of the thermodynamic cycle quantifies the electricity and water implications of the concept, showing (a) electricity savings exceeding 75% for the combined DC + industrial facility (~86% for the DC alone) relative to a benchmark configuration using a compression chiller and cooling tower, and (b) a modest increase in water consumption for the combined facility (14.8 – 23.9%), despite a reduction of 76.5 – 90.1% % in the industrial facility’s standalone water use. Geospatial analysis of existing DC and industrial facility locations shows that the two are typically in close proximity (median distance of 57 km). As a result, even when transportation energy requirements are considered, via an electrified truck, system-wide electricity savings could be notable in many scenarios (as high +45%). We discuss engineering design considerations, alternative deployment configurations, as well as geographic and coordination requirements for their widespread adoption.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Demonstrates native charge detection mass spectrometry for accurate intact mass/charge profiling of kilobase-scale mRNAs and their impurities, advancing analytical capabilities for large RNA molecules but with only indirect relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) enables direct measurement of mass and charge for individual ions and overcomes fundamental limitations of conventional electrospray mass spectrometry for large, heterogeneous biomolecules. Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) represent a particularly challenging analytical target, as transcripts often span thousands of nucleotides, exhibit substantial heterogeneity, and form higher-order oligomers that are difficult to assess using existing workflows. Here, we optimize and evaluate native CDMS for intact analysis of long mRNAs and conduct systematic comparison of positive and negative analysis polarities. Using a panel of commercially available mRNAs ranging from approximately 1,000 to 4,500 nucleotides, we demonstrate that native CDMS enables direct, and accurate mass measurement of intact mRNAs alongside various process-related impurities (truncations, dimers etc.). Collisional activation improves mass accuracy by reducing adduct heterogeneity while preserving the ability to resolve impurity populations. Across all constructs, CDMS provides quantitative access to charge distributions that scale with transcript length and respond predictably to activation, denaturation, and polarity, offering insight into ion charging behavior and charge accommodation for large RNAs. Negative polarity measurements generally access higher charge states than positive polarity, particularly for the largest transcripts, improving sensitivity and relative size discrimination, while intact mass accuracy remains comparable between polarities when appropriate ion transmission strategies are employed. Together, these results establish native CDMS as a versatile and information-rich platform for intact mRNA characterization, providing simultaneous access to mass, charge, and impurity information that complements existing analytical methods and supports emerging needs in RNA biotherapeutic development.</p>
