<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> A theoretical Marcus-type model proposes that partially solvated interfacial OH− can undergo concerted electron transfer to diverse acceptors in microdroplets, making redox reactions thermodynamically favorable and near-barrierless at the air–water interface—mechanistically relevant to prebiotic/interface chemistry but not directly focused on abiogenesis.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Microdroplet chemistry has emerged as a fascinating field. In particular, a plethora of unexpected oxidation and reduction reactions are observed at air–water interface with wide implications to chemical science and beyond. However, the explanation of microdroplet redox chemistry is challenging and controversial. Mechanistically, thermodynamic reversal over the bulk reaction, surprisingly fast kinetics (often less than milliseconds) and generality of a broad scope of substrates defy textbook understanding. Herein, we lay out a theoretical model of concerted interfacial electron transfer of OH- (partially solvated) + A^n → OH· (partially solvated) + A^{n-1}, rather than the conventional stepwise ionization-capture picture. Four different electron acceptors A^n (including a transition metal, an organic molecule, oxygen, ozone) are chosen to cover a wide range of experimental scenarios and chemical diversity. When A^n in the system is reduced upon receiving an electron, the accompanied product of OH· further serves as the oxidizing agent, capturing the intrinsic oxidative capacity of microdroplet. We then introduce a general energetic treatment to account for the partial solvation of OH- at heterogeneous water interface and develop a Marcus-theory-based reaction rate formalism that integrates the energetic distribution. We quantitatively analyze both the thermodynamic and the kinetic consequences of this model. For all four cases analyzed, the otherwise unfavorable thermodynamic penalty (ΔG° &gt; 0) for the bulk reaction is reversed at water interface (ΔG° &lt; 0) after a certain dehydration level. Remarkably, for all these cases, interfacial electron transfer becomes near-barrierless (ΔG° ≈ -λ, ΔG‡ ≤ 3 kcal/mol) for a substantial sub-population of partially solvated OH-. Thus, the water interface can prepare and gate a substantial donor population whose electrons are nearly ready to tunnel into a broad range of acceptors across the interface, which explains the surprisingly fast reaction rate observed in experiments. This model further predicts absolute rate constants that are in agreement with kinetic measurement on microdroplets. Finally, a phase diagram is constructed to depict the vast thermodynamic and kinetic (barrierless reaction) zones that are newly opened by the water interface, thus accounting for reaction generality. Despite its simplicity, this model provides a robust prediction for the rich redox chemistry at water interface.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study shows how ligand choice and copper nuclearity in discrete Mo–Cu sulfide clusters tune sulfur-centered hydrogen evolution thermochemistry and stability, offering a mineral-inspired catalyst framework potentially relevant to early Earth redox/energy chemistry but not directly addressing abiogenesis.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Heterobimetallic clusters comprising Group 6 thiometallates and earth-abundant transition metals are of significant interest for applications in laser technology, telecommunications, sensing, and catalysis. An advantage of clusters relative to the bulk-state materials is their tunable architecture, which enables precise modulation of physicochemical properties and reactivity through ligand and core structure manipulation. Recently, we reported the Mo–Cu cluster [Tp*MoS3(CuSPh)2]– ([1•(CuSPh)2]–; Tp* = tris(3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl)borate) as a discrete model of layered Cu2MoS4 and functional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) via a sulfur-centered pathway. While the Tp* ligand was found to be essential for stabilizing the clusters and precluding the formation of reactive Mo-hydrides, the impact of copper ligation and nuclearity remained uncertain. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterization of a series of derivatives, [1•(CuX)n]– and [1•(CuL)n]1–n, systematically varying the ancillary X- and L-type copper ligands. Single crystal XRD and 1H DOSY NMR analyses reveal that while nuclearities of n = 2-4 are accessible in the solid state, the higher-order clusters (n = 3, 4) exhibit significant solution-state lability. Electrocatalytic evaluations show that the new clusters are markedly less active for the HER than the thiophenolate parent. DFT calculations attribute this difference to the attenuated sulfur basicity and (in some cases) weaker S–H bonds that result from increased copper nuclearity, ancillary ligand donicity, or overall charge. Collectively, this work reveals that while copper ligation and nuclearity offer a modular approach to tuning HER thermochemistry, these changes also impact the cluster’s ability to maintain structural integrity under catalytic conditions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Presents ACCEL, an ML-guided self-driving lab that co-optimizes photoluminescence and XRD feedback to autonomously identify and stabilize phase-pure quasi-2D formamidinium halide perovskites.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) are poised to transform materials discovery by integrating automation with machine learning (ML) to accelerate data-driven experimentation. However, most SDL frameworks remain limited by single-feedback optimization and lack the multi-modal diagnostics needed to resolve both optical and structural evolution in complex hybrid systems. Here, we introduce ACCEL, an automated, ML-guided closed-loop platform for identifying and synthesizing target pure phases within quasi-2D halide perovskite systems. Using a ternary 3D:2D compositional space comprising 3D FAPbI3 and two Dion–Jacobson (DJ) spacer–based components, ACCEL optimizes the 3D:2D ratios to identify compositions that converge toward a structurally and optically stable α-FAPbI3-like phase within a quasi-2D design space. Automated in-situ photoluminescence (PL) is used to monitor crystallization kinetics in real time, revealing how the relative fraction of co-spacers governs nucleation rate and phase evolution during film formation. These kinetic insights are integrated with high-throughput synthesis, automated PL analysis, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) similarity metrics within a Gaussian Process–Bayesian Optimization framework to suppress phase heterogeneity and stabilize the target phase. Rather than targeting a predefined DJ layer number, ACCEL enables optimization based on user-defined optical and structural signatures, providing a generalizable route for autonomous phase discovery in complex hybrid materials.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Presents a DBSCAN-based algorithm to identify and classify coexisting water states and interfacial/quasi-liquid structures in clathrate hydrates, a potentially useful tool for interpreting icy planetary environments but not directly focused on origins-of-life chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Quantifying and differentiating the structural characteristics of clathrate hydrates at the molecular level is crucial for understanding the properties that underpin hydrate-based technologies. While useful, current approaches lack sufficient resolution to discern, e.g., interfacial and dynamical structures. In this study, we present an algorithm based on Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) that accurately identifies different water states coexisting within clathrate hydrates. A key novel component is an effective cavity-finder algorithm, which provides input to the clustering framework. The new algorithm detects hydrate cavities by analyzing the number and type of constituent molecular rings around voids. Integrating the new algorithm with widely used order parameters (e.g., F3, F4, and F4t) provides a powerful and accurate tool for analyzing hydrate structures at interfaces and phase transitions. The performance of the new algorithm is assessed for structure I (sI) CO2 hydrates and for structure II (sII) mixed CH4/Dioxane hydrates, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability across different clathrates. Crucially, the proposed algorithm enables us to identify partially ordered structures characteristic of the quasi-liquid layer, thereby capturing interfacial dynamics and molecular-scale details essential for understanding hydrates under realistic conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05514v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: As remarked by Boltzmann, the Second Law of Thermodynamics is notable for the fact that it is readily proved using elementary statistical arguments, but becomes harder and harder to verify the more precise the microscopic description of a system. In this article, we investigate one particular realization of the 2nd Law, namely Joule heating in a wire under electrical bias. We analyze the production of entropy in an exactly solvable model of a quantum wire wherein the conserved flow of entropy under unitary quantum evolution is taken into account using an exact formula for the entropy current of a system of independent quantum particles. In this exact microscopic description of the quantum dynamics, the entropy production due to Joule heating does not arise automatically. Instead, we show that the expected entropy production is realized in the limit of a large number of local measurements by a series of floating thermoelectric probes along the length of the wire, which inject entropy into the system as a result of the information obtained via their continuous measurements of the system. The decoherence resulting from inelastic processes introduced by the local measurements is essential to the phenomenon of entropy production due to Joule heating, and would be expected to arise due to inelastic scattering in real systems of interacting particles.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05925v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The distribution of entanglement between the nodes of a quantum network plays a fundamental role in quantum information applications. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of a network of qubits where each edge corresponds to an independent two-qubit interaction. By applying tools from percolation theory, we study how entanglement dynamically spreads across the network. We show that the interplay between unitary evolution and spatially correlated disorder leads to a non-standard percolation phenomenology, significantly richer than uniform bond percolation and featuring hysteresis. A two-colour correlated bond percolation model, whose phase diagram is determined via numerical simulations and a mean-field theory, fully elucidates the physics behind this phenomenon.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05277v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: This article proposes a research and development direction that would lead to the creation of next-generation intelligent technical systems. A distinctive feature of these systems is their ability to undergo evolutionary change. Cognitive architectures are now one of the most promising ways to create Artificial General Intelligence systems. One of the main problems of modern cognitive architectures is an excessively schematic approach to modeling the processes of cognitive activity. It does not allow the creation of a universal architecture that would be capable of reproducing higher nervous functions without using a predetermined set of perception patterns. Our paper proposes an evolutionary approach to creating a cognitive architecture. The basis of this approach is the use of a functional core, which consistently generates the intellectual functions of an autonomous agent. We are considering a cognitive architecture that includes components, the interaction of which ensures the evolution of the agent. The discussion of the development of intelligence is carried out using the conceptual apparatus of semiotics. This allows us to consider the task of developing cognitive functions as a problem of establishing a connection between the Merkwelt and the Werkwelt through the creation of the Innenwelt. The problem of early postnatal ontogenesis is investigated on the basis of the theory of constructivism: we discuss the requirements for the functional core and its composition, as well as the mechanism that initiates the process of cognition.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05994v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Resilience is a property of social, ecological, social-ecological and biophysical systems. It describes the capacity of a system to cope with, adapt to and innovate in response to a changing surrounding. Given the current climate change crisis, ensuring conditions for a sustainable future for the habitability on the planet is fundamentally dependent on Earth System (ES) resilience. It is thus particularly relevant to establish a model that captures and frames resilience of the ES, most particularly in physical terms that can be influenced by human policy\footnote{See page 4 for examples of strategies}. In this work we propose that resilience can serve as a theoretical foundation when unpacking and describing metastable states of equilibrium and energy dissipation in any dynamic description of the variables that characterise the ES. Since the impact of the human activities can be suitably gauged by the planetary boundaries (PBs) and the planet&#x27;s temperature is the net result of the multiple PB variables, such as $\text{CO}_2$ concentration and radiative forcing, atmospheric aerosol loading, atmospheric ozone depletion, etc, then resilience features arise once conditions to avoid an ES runaway to a state where the average temperature is much higher than the current one. Our model shows that this runaway can be prevented by the presence of metastable states and dynamic friction built out of the interaction among the PB variables once suitable conditions are satisfied. In this work these conditions are specified. As humanity moves away from Holocene conditions, we argue that resilience features arising from metastable states might be crucial for the ES to follow sustainable trajectories in the Anthropocene that prevent it run into a much hotter potential equilibrium state.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05387v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: One of the key goals of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is to directly image about 25 potentially habitable exoplanets and determine their properties. This challenge will require a large survey of nearby, bright stars -- ~100 according to the Astro2020 Decadel Survey. To ensure the success of the mission and to help guide design decisions, the stellar multiplicity of the target stars must be well-understood. To this end, we present optical speckle imaging of stars in the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) provisional HWO star list, which is currently the Tier 1 target list for the HWO Target Stars and Systems Sub-Working Group. We obtained new observations using `Alopeke and Zorro at Gemini Observatory and queried the Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program Archive for archival observations, resulting in speckle imaging data for 80 of the 164 stars. We confirmed one candidate companion detected previously by Gaia (HD 90089) and obtained an ambiguous detection of a known companion (HD 212330). To examine our sensitivity to companions, we simulated stellar companions down to ~0.1 $M_{\odot}$ for each target and found that 75%-85% would be detected in our speckle images; the remaining simulated companions are either too faint or too close-in, and will require follow-up using other methods such as long-term spectroscopic measurements and space-based techniques. This work represents a first step towards surveying potential HWO targets for close-in stellar companions and helping to inform the target selection process for the HWO direct-imaging survey, bringing us closer towards the discovery of potential habitable worlds.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05480v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The abundances of atmospheric carbon species--carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4)--exert fundamental controls on the climate, redox state, and prebiotic environment of terrestrial planets. As exoplanet atmospheric characterization advances, it is essential to understand how these species are regulated on habitable terrestrial planets across a wide range of stellar and planetary conditions. Here, we develop an integrated numerical model that couples atmospheric chemistry, climate, and the long-term carbon cycle to investigate the atmospheric compositions of lifeless, Earth-like planets orbiting Sun-like (F-, G-, and K-type) stars. Our simulations demonstrate that CO2, CO, and CH4 generally increase with orbital distance, and that planets near the outer edge of the habitable zone may undergo CO runaway--a photochemical instability driven by severe depletion of OH radicals. The threshold for CO runaway depends strongly on stellar spectral type and is most easily triggered around cooler, lower-mass stars. In contrast, the atmospheric production of formaldehyde (H2CO)--a key precursor for prebiotic organic chemistry--peaks around planets orbiting more massive, UV-luminous stars and is maximized at orbital distances just interior to the CO-runaway threshold. These results establish a quantitative framework linking observable system properties--stellar type and orbital distance--and the atmospheric carbon chemistry of lifeless Earth-like planets, providing new context for interpreting future spectroscopic observations and for evaluating the potential of such planets to sustain prebiotic chemistry.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05313v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Available one-dimensional stellar models fail to reproduce the observed spectrum of the ultracool M dwarf TRAPPIST-1. In particular, current models predict strong iron hydride (FeH) absorption due to the Wing-Ford bands at 0.99$\mu$m, yet this spectral feature is only weakly present in TRAPPIST-1 and other mid-to-late M dwarf stars. Additionally, the shape of the continuum between the water bands in the near-infrared does not match between models and observations. Here, we show that assumptions about pressure broadening, specifically van der Waals broadening, have a dramatic effect on modeled broadband spectral features. We use Merged Parallelized Simplified-ATLAS to generate synthetic spectra over a range of van der Waals broadening strengths, adopting 1D PHOENIX temperature-pressure structures. We find that minimal broadening best matches the observed FeH profile at 0.99$\mu$m and in the pseudocontinuum between the large water bands. These results suggest that broadening prescriptions derived for Sun-like stars are not valid for lower-mass stars and that pressure broadening for molecular lines in cool stellar atmospheres must be reevaluated. Refining pressure broadening treatments will improve the accuracy of M dwarf spectral models, enabling more reliable determinations of stellar properties and atmospheric compositions of planets orbiting M dwarfs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.10060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant shift in astrochemistry with a renewed focus on the role of non-thermal processes on the molecular interstellar medium, in particular energetic particles (such as cosmic ray particles and fast electrons) and X-ray radiation. This has been brought about in large part due to new observations of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMS) in environments that would inhibit their formation, such as cold, dense gas in prestellar cores or in the highly energetic environments in galactic centers. In parallel, there has been a plethora of new laboratory investigations on the role of high-energy radiation and electrons on the chemistry of astrophysical ices, demonstrating the ability of this radiation to induce complex chemistry. In recent years, theoretical models have also begun to include newer cosmic-ray-driven processes in both the gas and ice phases. In this review, we unify aspects of the chemistry driven by X-ray radiation and energetic particles into a ``high-energy astrochemistry&#x27;&#x27;, defining this term and reviewing the underlying chemical processes. We conclude by examining various laboratories where high-energy astrochemistry is at play and identify future issues to be tackled.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05389v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We examine the differences between the driven turbulence described by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation and the second law of thermodynamics. A general velocity and entropy density system is analyzed with the unified thermodynamic algorithm of metriplectic dynamics, and we show that the positive spectra of the KS equation due to an external energy source prevent its metriplectic description. A variant of the KS equation is produced that monotonically generates an entropy, but the only equilibria of this variant system are spatially constant. Numerical experiments are performed comparing the evolution of the KS equation and its thermodynamic variant. The entropy of this thermodynamic system is increased further by the driving effects of the KS equation, reconciling the generation of entropy with the energy source of the KS equation. Further numerical experiments restrict the positive spectra in the KS equation to determine the effect on the system time evolution. While rescaling the growth rates of instabilities reproduces similar behavior on a slower time scale, introduction of individual positive spectra reproduces the formation of equilibria, relative equilibria, and a transition to chaos.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05932v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Binaries occur in many astrophysical systems, from young protostellar binaries in star forming regions to supermassive black hole binaries in galaxy centers. In many cases, a circumbinary disk of gas forms around the binary with an orbit that may be misaligned to the binary plane. Misaligned disks around nearly circular binaries evolve into disks that are either aligned or counteraligned with the binary orbit. However, if the binary is sufficiently eccentric, then it can be more likely that the disk ends up in a polar-aligned configuration in which the disk angular momentum vector aligns with the binary eccentricity vector. We use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations, evolved to an approximate steady state under mass injection, to determine the orbital evolution of a binary with a polar-aligned disk for a range of binary-disk parameters. We find that, in all of the cases we have simulated, the binary shrinks with time. The decay rate is larger than for binaries surrounded by aligned or retrograde disks with matched disk parameters. The rate of shrinkage is largely unaltered by the size of the sink radii employed for the binary stars, but for small enough sink radii some of the models exhibit long-lived polar circumprimary disks, which are continually fed mass from the circumbinary disk. We discuss our results in the contexts of planet formation in young polar-aligned disks and merging supermassive black holes in galaxy centers.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05423v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Standard fractional calculus has successfully modeled systems with power-law memory. However, complex phenomena in heterogeneous media often exhibit multi-scale memory effects and aging properties that classical operators cannot capture. In this work, we construct a unified framework by defining the \textit{Weighted Weyl-Sonine Operators}. This formalism offers a fundamental generalization of fractional calculus, freeing the theory from the constraints of power-law memory (via Sonine kernels), time-translation invariance (via scale and weight functions), and artificial history truncation (via Weyl integration). The main result is a Generalized Spectral Mapping Theorem, proving that the Weighted Fourier Transform acts as a universal diagonalization map for these operators. We rigorously characterize the admissible memory kernels through the class of \textit{Complete Bernstein Functions}, ensuring that the resulting operators preserve the fundamental properties of positivity and monotonicity. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical bridge between the algebraic Sonine definition and the analytical Marchaud representation involving L\&#x27;evy measures. Finally, we apply this theory to solve generalized relaxation equations and \textit{Weighted Distributed Order} evolution problems, demonstrating that phenomena of ultra-slow diffusion and retarded aging can be treated explicitly within this unified spectral framework.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> G-rich repetitive nucleic acid sequences can fold into G-quadruplexes (G4s) upon coordination with potassium ions (K+). Small natural and synthetic molecules (G4 ligands) can bind to and stabilize G4 structures in vitro, thereby interfering with biological processes involving G4-containing genes. Therefore, G4 ligands represent highly valuable tools for unveiling G4 biological functions. Together with non-covalent reversible G4 ligands, reactive compounds capable of forming covalent bonds with G4s upon thermal and photochemical activation represent a new class of promising G4 ligands with the potential to be harnessed for the identification and isolation of G4s from a biological environment. In particular, photoaffinity labelling (PAL) encompasses the potential to obtain spatial and temporal control over the alkylation event. However, to date, only a few examples of covalent G4 ligands for PAL approaches have been described, and very low alkylation yields plague all of them. Herein, the synthesis of new families of photoactivatable G4 ligands functionalized with different warheads (e.g., benzophenones and diazirines) is described, as well as their photoreactivity in the presence of three different G4s: 22AG, cMyc, and 25CEBwt. Among the different compounds, diazirine derivatives displayed the highest G4 selectivity and unprecedented high alkylation yields (up to 70%) together with a remarkable selective N- and O-alkylation reaction only on thymine and guanine nucleobases as identified by using a prototype ligand. These new compounds pave the way for the development of new methodologies, allowing for functional investigation and druggability of G4 in cells.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05976v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We present a rotational velocity (vsini) survey of 32 stellar/substellar objects and giant planets using Keck/KPIC high-resolution spectroscopy, including 6 giant planets (2-7 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) and 25 substellar/stellar companions (12-88 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$). Adding companions with spin measurements from the literature, we construct a curated spin sample for 43 benchmark stellar/substellar companions and giant planets and 54 free-floating brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects. We compare their spins, parameterized as fractional breakup velocities at 10 Myr, assuming constant angular momentum evolution. We find the first clear evidence that giant planets exhibit distinct spins versus low-mass brown dwarf companions (10 to 40 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) at 4-4.5 $\sigma$ significance assuming inclinations aligned with their orbits, while under randomly oriented inclinations the significance is at 1.6-2.1 $\sigma$. Our findings hold when considering various assumptions about planets, and the mass ratio below 0.8% gives a clean cut for rotation between giant planets and brown dwarf companions. The higher fractional breakup velocities of planets can be interpreted as less angular momentum loss through circumplanetary disk braking during the planet formation phase. Brown dwarf companions exhibit evidence of slower rotation compared to isolated brown dwarfs, while planets and planetary mass objects show similar spins. Finally, our analysis of specific angular momentum versus age of 221 stellar/substellar objects below 0.1 MSun with spin measurements in the literature indicates that the substellar objects of 5-40 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ retain much higher angular momenta compared to stellar and substellar objects of 40-100 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ after 10 Myr, when their initial angular momenta were set.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2407.13154v4 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Planetary systems with multiple transiting planets are beneficial for understanding planet occurrence rates and system architectures. Although we have yet to find a solar system analogue, future surveys may detect multiple terrestrial planets transiting a Sun-like star. In this work, we simulate transit timing observations of our system based on the actual orbital motions of Venus and the Earth+Moon (EM) -- influenced by the other solar system objects -- and retrieve the system&#x27;s dynamical parameters for varying noise levels and observing durations. Using an approximate coplanar N-body model for transit-time variations, we consider test configurations with 2, 3, and 4 planets. For various observing baselines, we can robustly retrieve the masses and orbits of Venus and EM; detect Jupiter at high significance (for &lt; 90-second timing error and baseline $\leq$ 15 yrs); and detect Mars at 5 $\sigma$ confidence (with &lt; 20-second timing error and baseline $\geq$ 27 yrs) using TTVFaster. We also find that the 3-planet model is generally preferred, and provide equations to estimate the mass precision of Venus/Earth/Jupiter-analogues. The addition of Mars -- which is near a 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Earth -- improves our retrieval of Jupiter&#x27;s parameters, suggesting that unseen terrestrials could interfere in the characterization of multi-planetary systems. Our findings are comparable to theoretical limits based upon stellar variability and may eventually be possible.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05758v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Ice nucleation is greatly important in areas as diverse as climate change, cryobiology, geology or food industry. Predicting the ability of a substrate to induce the nucleation of ice from supercooled water is a difficult problem. Here, we use molecular simulations to analyse how the ice nucleating ability is affected by the substrate lattice structure and orientation. We focus on different model lattices: simple cubic, body centred cubic and face centred cubic, and assess their ability to induce ice nucleation by calculating nucleation rates. Several orientations are studied for the case of the face centred cubic lattice. Curiously, a hexagonal symmetry does not guarantee a better ice nucleating ability. By comparing the body centred cubic and the cubic lattices we determined that there is a significant role of the underlying crystal plane(s) on ice nucleation. The structure of the liquid layer adjacent to the substrate reveals that more efficient nucleants induce a more structured liquid. The most efficient substrates present a strong sensitivity of their ice nucleating ability to the lattice parameters. Introducing a novel methodological approach, we use Classical Nucleation Theory to estimate the contact angle of the ice nucleus on the studied substrates from the calculated nucleation rates. The method also provides the nucleation free energy barrier height, the kinetic pre-factor and the critical cluster size. The latter is in agreement with the nucleus size obtained through a microscopic analysis of the nucleation trajectories, which supports the validity of Classical Nucleation Theory down to small critical clusters.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2507.11300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) chalcogenides are stable, non-toxic candidates for optoelectronic or thermoelectric applications. The structural diversity of RP oxides is already exploited to tune properties or achieve more advanced functionalities like multiferroicity, however, little is known about the structural evolution of RP chalcogenides. In this work, we develop a high-accuracy machine-learned interatomic potential to run large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on $Ba_{n+1}Zr_nS_{3n+1}$ for $n=1$ to $n=6$. We predict new polymorphs for each $n$-value, calculate their corresponding phase transition temperatures, and validate our approach through comparison to published experimental results. We find that the $n=1$ phase exhibits negative thermal expansion, that $n=1$ and $n=3$ undergo unusual ascending symmetry breaking, and that phases with $n\geq4$ form layer-dependent tilt patterns previously unreported for inorganic RP materials. This unique behaviour results from competition between octahedral rotations and rumpling at the rocksalt interface, and suggests new strategies for accessing advanced functionalities.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2508.08012v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Complex physical simulations often require trade-offs between model fidelity and computational feasibility. We introduce Adaptive Online Emulation (AOE), which dynamically learns neural network surrogates during simulation execution to accelerate expensive components. Unlike existing methods requiring extensive offline training, AOE uses Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machines (OS-ELMs) to continuously adapt emulators along the actual simulation trajectory. We employ a numerically stable variant of the OS-ELM using cumulative sufficient statistics to avoid matrix inversion instabilities. AOE integrates with time-stepping frameworks through a three-phase strategy balancing data collection, updates, and surrogate usage, while requiring orders of magnitude less training data than conventional surrogate approaches. Demonstrated on a 1D atmospheric model of exoplanet GJ1214b, AOE achieves 11.1 times speedup (91% time reduction) across 200,000 timesteps while maintaining accuracy, potentially making previously intractable high-fidelity time-stepping simulations computationally feasible.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05792v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Accurate drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is essential for computational drug discovery, yet existing models often rely on single-modality predefined molecular descriptors or sequence-based embeddings with limited representativeness. We propose Tensor-DTI, a contrastive learning framework that integrates multimodal embeddings from molecular graphs, protein language models, and binding-site predictions to improve interaction modeling. Tensor-DTI employs a siamese dual-encoder architecture, enabling it to capture both chemical and structural interaction features while distinguishing interacting from non-interacting pairs. Evaluations on multiple DTI benchmarks demonstrate that Tensor-DTI outperforms existing sequence-based and graph-based models. We also conduct large-scale inference experiments on CDK2 across billion-scale chemical libraries, where Tensor-DTI produces chemically plausible hit distributions even when CDK2 is withheld from training. In enrichment studies against Glide docking and Boltz-2 co-folder, Tensor-DTI remains competitive on CDK2 and improves the screening budget required to recover moderate fractions of high-affinity ligands on out-of-family targets under strict family-holdout splits. Additionally, we explore its applicability to protein-RNA and peptide-protein interactions. Our findings highlight the benefits of integrating multimodal information with contrastive objectives to enhance interaction-prediction accuracy and to provide more interpretable and reliability-aware models for virtual screening.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05891v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The splitting of the principal peak in the structure factor of liquid water is commonly interpreted as evidence of a competition between two distinct local environments. Here, we show that this peak splitting arises from medium-range topological features of the hydrogen-bond network. Using atomistic simulations, we systematically decompose the structure factor into contributions from hydrogen-bonded rings of different sizes. We find that 5-8-membered rings, which dominate the network topology of liquid water at low temperatures, can directly explain the experimentally observed bimodal scattering signal. Among these, 5-membered rings are particularly persistent, maintaining distinct structural signatures even above room temperature. Our findings establish a direct link between the network topology of liquid water and experimentally accessible diffraction features, clarifying the microscopic basis of water&#x27;s behaviour and suggesting a broader conceptual framework for interpreting the anomalies in tetrahedral network liquids and glasses.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> G-rich repetitive nucleic acid sequences can fold into G-quadruplexes (G4s) upon coordination with potassium ions (K+). Small natural and synthetic molecules (G4 ligands) can bind to and stabilize G4 structures in vitro, thereby interfering with biological processes involving G4-containing genes. Therefore, G4 ligands represent highly valuable tools for unveiling G4 biological functions. Together with non-covalent reversible G4 ligands, reactive compounds capable of forming covalent bonds with G4s upon thermal and photochemical activation represent a new class of promising G4 ligands with the potential to be harnessed for the identification and isolation of G4s from a biological environment. In particular, photoaffinity labelling (PAL) encompasses the potential to obtain spatial and temporal control over the alkylation event. However, to date, only a few examples of covalent G4 ligands for PAL approaches have been described, and very low alkylation yields plague all of them. Herein, the synthesis of new families of photoactivatable G4 ligands functionalized with different warheads (e.g., benzophenones and diazirines) is described, as well as their photoreactivity in the presence of three different G4s: 22AG, cMyc, and 25CEBwt. Among the different compounds, diazirine derivatives displayed the highest G4 selectivity and unprecedented high alkylation yields (up to 70%) together with a remarkable selective N- and O-alkylation reaction only on thymine and guanine nucleobases as identified by using a prototype ligand. These new compounds pave the way for the development of new methodologies, allowing for functional investigation and druggability of G4 in cells.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Immune cells play essential roles in maintaining tissue homeostasis and responding to abnormal growth, but how innate immune cells adapt to chronic apoptotic signaling remains poorly understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, hemocytes, particularly plasmatocytes, are recruited to tumor-like overgrowths, yet their transcriptional diversity and lineage dynamics under these conditions remain undefined. Here, we apply single-cell RNA sequencing to nearly 50,000 circulating and sessile hemocytes from larvae bearing undead overgrown eye discs, a model of regenerative overgrowth driven by sustained caspase activity. We resolve 17 transcriptionally distinct hemocyte clusters, including known lineages and 13 previously unrecognized plasmatocyte subtypes. Interestingly, specific plasmatocyte populations are differentially expanded or depleted under overgrowth conditions. Notably, we identify a matrix-remodeling plasmatocyte population marked by high expression of Jonah-family serine proteases. Pseudotime analysis reveals unexpected plasmatocyte plasticity and two novel terminally differentiated effector states. These findings define the immune landscape of tumor-like overgrowth and establish Drosophila as a platform for dissecting innate immune responses to tissue stress and dysregulated growth in vivo.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In eukaryotes, transcription elongation factors (TEFs) associate with RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) to facilitate gene expression and couple transcription to co-transcriptional processes, including chromatin regulation and RNA processing. To further our understanding of TEF biology, we developed a domain-centric analysis pipeline to perform a broad survey of ten TEF orthologs -- Paf1, Ctr9, Cdc73, Rtf1, Leo1, Spt4, Spt5, Spt6, Spn1, and Elf1 -- across the Tree of Life and analyze their evolutionary patterns in a structural context. We report evidence for all ten TEFs being present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor, indicating that mechanisms of TEF-mediated transcription regulation are both ancient and conserved. However, some early-diverging eukaryotic clades exhibit signs of altered TEF domain composition. A comparative phylogenetic analysis highlighted conserved regions of TEFs that are detected in both metazoans and fungi and other regions that appear clade-specific, detected only in metazoans. These observations, together with additional insights generated from evolutionary rate covariation analysis, shed light on under-characterized aspects of TEFs, including domains for which functions have yet to be dissected.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In eukaryotic cells, almost all mRNA transcripts are polyadenylated in the nucleus, with the poly(A)-tail being critical for their export, translation and stability. PABPC1 is a multifunctional RNA-binding protein (RBP) that binds poly(A)-tails and is a key driver of mRNA post-transcriptional regulation. It achieves this in part by interacting with a broad range of PAM2-motif containing proteins that bind the same common site within PABPC1&#x27;s PABC domain but result in diverse regulatory outcomes. Regulation of this intricate network of interactions remains poorly understood but our previous studies revealed the regulatory potential of mutually-exclusive acetylation or dimethylation of a key lysine sidechain (K606). To address this, we undertook a systematic study of PAM2-motifs, identifying translation termination factor eRF3a and translation repressor PAIP2 as having a &gt;ten-fold higher affinity for PABPC1 relative to eleven other PAM2-motif partner proteins. Acetylation of PABPC1 at K606 specifically enhances its affinity for eRF3a in vitro, and we present the crystal structure of the specifically K606 acetylated C-terminal domain of PABPC1 in complex with the PAM2 motif of eRF3a, providing structural and functional insights into how acetylation facilitates competitive eRF3a recruitment to PABPC1 and mRNA. We further demonstrate that K606 acetylation promotes PABPC1-eRF3a interaction in cells, thereby antagonising other PAM2-dependent RNA effectors. Taken together, our results show that acetylation of lysine 606 in the PABC domain can specifically modulate PABPC1 partner selectivity, providing crucial insight into how PABPC1 multifunctionality can be regulated to coordinate mRNA usage and fate in the cytoplasm.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This preprint dissects how chronic stress alters eukaryotic RNA stress granule/P-body dynamics via myosin and nucleator proteins, a modern cell-biology finding with only indirect relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Stress granules (SGs) are dynamic RNA granules that rapidly form in response to various stresses concurrent with mRNA translation shutdown, contributing to cellular adaptation and disease pathogenesis. While SG assembly and disassembly under acute stress have been extensively characterized, how SGs behave under chronic stress remains poorly understood. We previously reported that chronic stress preconditioning inhibits the earliest steps of SG assembly via translation-dependent mechanisms. In contrast, the regulation of SG maturation under chronic stress has not yet been investigated. Here, we show that chronic stress decreases SG size by disrupting the MYH9-dependent myosin crosstalk with core SG nucleator G3BP1. This defect leads to impaired SG and processing body (PB) docking as well, limiting the biogenesis of early SGs. Furthermore, chronic stress reduces expression of the SG nucleator UBAP2L, required for SG-PB docking, thus exacerbating these deficiences. In summary, chronic stress disrupts the myosin-SG-PB network and inhibits SG maturation in a translation-independent manner.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Compares direct prebiotic chemical synthesis versus prolonged chemical evolution models for the emergence of RNA (and other biopolymers), outlining distinct predictions and experimental implications for abiogenesis on early Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Direct chemical synthesis and chemical evolution are conceptually different models for the prebiotic origin of RNA and other biopolymers. These models generate distinct predictions and motivate different experimental approaches. Here, we compare these two models. In the direct chemical synthesis model, the inherent chemical reactivities of prebiotic compounds on the ancient Earth led to RNA, which subsequently initiated Darwinian evolution. The direct synthesis model depends upon the prebiotic availability of sugars, nucleic acid bases, amino acids, and other chemical species. In this model stepwise chemical reactions directed by inherent reactivities of small molecule feedstocks combine in serial and parallel reactions to produce RNA. The basis of selection is generally limited to inherent chemical reactivities in systems with low chemical heterogeneity. In a fundamentally different and more recent model, it is assumed that RNA emerged along with other biopolymers during a prolonged period of chemical evolution occurring in complex ensembles of organic compounds under dynamic, continually shifting selective pressures. The evolutionary model presages a deep biological entanglement between various types of biomolecules. If chemical evolution produced molecules such as RNA and protein and glycan, then humankind will gain advantage by understanding and redirecting these processes.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Structural and mechanistic study of the human tRNA m5C methyltransferase NSUN2 showing structure-driven, sequence-tolerant tRNA remodeling for cytosine methylation, with a reported small-molecule inhibitor, but only tangential relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The human RNA m5C methyltransferase NSUN2 catalyzes site-specific cytosine methylation across diverse RNA substrates and thereby regulates a wide range of biological and physiological processes. However, the molecular basis by which NSUN2 achieves broad substrate recognition while maintaining catalytic specificity has remained unclear. Here we determine structures of human NSUN2 in both substrate-free and substrate-bound states using X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy. Structures of NSUN2 in complex with multiple tRNA substrates reveal a structure-first, sequence-tolerant strategy in which NSUN2 actively remodels tRNA architecture, exposing the buried target cytosine and positioning it within the catalytic pocket for methyl transfer. This recognition strategy enables NSUN2 to accommodate diverse tRNA substrates through a largely conserved interaction interface. Guided by these structural insights, we identify a small-molecule inhibitor that suppresses NSUN2 activity and cancer cell proliferation. Together, our findings define the molecular principles underlying NSUN2-mediated RNA m5C modification and provide a structural foundation for targeting NSUN2 in cancers.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Presents a scalable computational method to infer mutation fitness effects from short-read time-series sequencing while accounting for genetic linkage, demonstrated on within-host HIV and SARS-CoV-2 datasets.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Inferring the fitness effect of mutations is a basic problem in understanding the evolution of populations over time. When multiple mutations are present in a population simultaneously, genetic linkage comes into play, and the fate of an individual mutation depends on both its fitness as well as the background on which it occurs. Accurate inference of fitness effects for evolutionary systems with multiple competing mutations is therefore contingent on resolving the confounding effects of genetic linkage, captured by the covariance between allele-pairs. Increasingly, evolutionary studies are using short-read sequencing technologies to produce detailed snapshots of evolving populations. This presents a problem as the frequencies of allele-pairs are not known beyond the read-length, hampering any attempt to resolve the effects of genetic linkage between pairs of loci residing on different reads. Here we present a computationally efficient pipeline for inferring selection from short-read time-series data with partial allele-pair frequency information, while accounting for linkage. Simulation results show that the method has good performance and is scalable to systems with several thousand variants. Additionally, we demonstrate the pipelines utility on real datasets of within-host HIV and SARS-CoV-2 evolution, showcasing its applicability in resolving linkage effects from complex evolutionary histories.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces OKR-CELL, a large-scale cross-modal single-cell RNA-seq foundation model that uses LLM/RAG-enriched cell descriptions and a robust alignment objective to improve performance across multi-omics and cell-text retrieval tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recent advancements in single-cell multi-omics, particularly RNA-seq, have provided profound insights into cellular heterogeneity and gene regulation. While pre-trained language model (PLM) paradigm based single-cell foundation models have shown promise, they remain constrained by insufficient integration of in-depth individual profiles and neglecting the influence of noise within multi-modal data. To address both issues, we propose an Open-world Language Knowledge-Aided Robust Single-Cell Foundation Model (OKR-CELL). It is built based on a cross-modal Cell-Language pre-training framework, which comprises two key innovations: (1) leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) based workflow with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches cell textual descriptions using open-world knowledge; (2) devising a Cross-modal Robust Alignment (CRA) objective that incorporates sample reliability assessment, curriculum learning, and coupled momentum contrastive learning to strengthen the model&#x27;s resistance to noisy data. After pretraining on 32M cell-text pairs, OKR-CELL obtains cutting-edge results across 6 evaluation tasks. Beyond standard benchmarks such as cell clustering, cell-type annotation, batch-effect correction, and few-shot annotation, the model also demonstrates superior performance in broader multi-modal applications, including zero-shot cell-type annotation and bidirectional cell-text retrieval.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Methodological study on how single-cell RNA-seq reference choice affects deconvolution accuracy in breast cancer spatial transcriptomics, with no direct relevance to origins-of-life questions beyond incidental RNA mention.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Background Spot-based Spatial transcriptomics (ST) allows for unbiased gene expression analysis within tissue architecture, overcoming the limitations of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) by preserving spatial context. However, the high spatial resolution in ST leads to cellular heterogeneity within spots, requiring computational deconvolution to infer cellular compositions. While scRNA-seq serves as a key reference for deconvolution, the impact of reference composition on its accuracy is still unclear. In this study, we systematically evaluate the impact of reference selection for cellular deconvolution and give helpful guide-lines to researchers to address this task. Methods We systematically evaluate the impact of single-cell reference selection for global and cell type-specific deconvolution performances in primary and metastatic breast cancer ST datasets. Focusing on state-of-the-art deconvolution tools Cell2location and Robust Cell Type Decomposition (RCTD), we assess the influence of varying reference sizes, cell-type distributions, reference-ST pairings,as well as the usage of large breast cancer and cross-cancer atlases. Results Our findings demonstrate that even small reference datasets can yield accurate deconvolution results, with RCTD and Cell2location exhibiting similar performances across cell-types. Heterogeneous entities, such as myeloids, presented greater challenges for accurate deconvolution compared to more distinct ones, such as epithelial cells. Spatial domains associated with prominent cell types like cancer and stromal cells were detected, although their contributions were systematically under- or over-estimated Additionally, we found that perfect reference-ST matching enhances deconvolution accuracy compared to the usage of cross-patient references. Finally, large breast cancer single-cell atlases composed of a diverse set of patients were also able to provide reliable deconvolution results. Conclusion This study provides important insights into optimizing reference selection for ST deconvolution, highlighting the strengths and limitations of current computational tools in addressing cellular heterogeneity within spatial transcriptomics datasets.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A fundamental question in biology is whether cellular aging is inevitable. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) challenge this paradigm as rare normal cells capable of indefinite in vitro passage. However, the mechanisms underlying ESC lineage immortality remain unresolved. Using long-term live-cell imaging to follow fates of single ESCs, we show here that ESC lineage renewal is achieved through sporadic entry into a state characterized by the expression of two-cell embryo-specific markers. During this state, cells undergo asymmetric divisions, segregating accumulated DNA damage into one daughter lineage destined for elimination, while producing a second lineage that reverts to the pluripotent state. Importantly, the latter lineage exhibits signs of rejuvenation, including reduced DNA damage and enhanced chimeric efficiency. These findings underscore the crucial role of asymmetric cell division in maintaining the long-term health of the ESC lineage against mounting damage within individual cells, a potential model for studying cellular aging and rejuvenation in mammalian cells.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces an optimal-transport-based machine learning framework to predict single-cell transcriptional responses to unseen genetic perturbations using biologically informed gene representations, but it has minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research beyond general RNA/gene biology context.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The combination of pooled genetic perturbation screening with single-cell RNA-sequencing has allowed for large-scale profiling of single-cell transcriptional responses, providing valuable insights into gene function and cellular behavior. There is a need for computational methods capable of predicting single-cell responses to novel genetic perturbations, thereby allowing for the efficient exploration of the vast combinatorial space of potential multi-gene perturbations. Optimal transport (OT) presents a compelling framework to model this type of data given the lack of true control-perturbed cell pairings. However, existing neural OT models are generally constrained to the perturbations already seen in training, while the use of OT theory in methods capable of modeling novel genetic perturbations remains limited. To bridge this gap, we present an OT-based method to predict single-cell transcriptional responses to novel genetic perturbations. Leveraging a flexible attention-based aggregation approach, our method integrates gene representations from multiple sources of prior knowledge, spanning from functional descriptions of genes to gene-gene relationships, producing a biologically informed representation of the perturbation. Moreover, we utilize an OT-based loss to align predicted and observed perturbed cell populations, avoiding the need to assign random control-perturbed cell pairings. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the highly competitive performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art methods. Further evaluations on differential expression analysis and genetic interaction modeling demonstrate the biological relevance and potential utility of our model across diverse applications.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study dissects how the short N-terminus of Giardia’s annexin orthologue alpha-1 giardin controls oligomerization and lipid binding, clarifying a mechanism for unconventional protein secretion in a parasitic eukaryote.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Annexins are Ca2+ and membrane-binding proteins conserved across eukaryotes and involved in diverse membrane-associated processes, including unconventional protein secretion (UPS). In the intestinal parasite Giardia lamblia, annexins are represented by a family of 21 proteins termed alpha-giardins, all of which lack classical signal peptides yet are detected at the parasite surface and in the secretome. Here, we present a comprehensive functional analysis of alphaGs, with a particular focus on alpha 1-giardin, a leading vaccine candidate against giardiasis and a putative virulence-associated UPS substrate. We show that alphaGs localize to peripheral endocytic compartments (PECs), specialized endo-lysosomal organelles implicated in protein release, and engage in multiprotein complexes enriched in UPS substrates. Using lipid-binding assays, cross-linking mass spectrometry, and structural modelling, we define conserved and divergent features of G membrane interactions. Focusing on 1G, we combine site-directed mutagenesis, confocal microscopy, and mass photometry to demonstrate a critical role for its short N-terminal region in oligomerization and membrane association. Integration of these data with molecular dynamics simulations reveals how alpha1G&#x27;s oligomeric state and membrane occupancy are regulated at PEC membranes. Together, our findings establish a mechanistic framework for annexin-mediated UPS in Giardia and provide structural insights relevant to parasite virulence and vaccine development.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Abnormal nuclear blebbing occurs in many human diseases and causes nuclear rupture and dysfunction. Nuclear blebbing is caused by chromatin motion via RNA Pol II transcriptional activity and nuclear mechanical weakening. Camptothecin, a topoisomerase I inhibitor, rapidly suppresses nuclear blebbing within hours. We find that camptothecin does not decrease RNA Pol II phosphorylation, but does decrease newly synthesized RNA, likely by stalling RNA Pol II. However, camptothecin treatment suppresses nuclear blebbing more drastically than inhibition of transcription activity by alpha amanitin, suggesting a second mechanism of nuclear blebbing suppression. Dual micromanipulation nuclear force measures revealed camptothecin treatment increased chromatin-based nuclear stiffness but not lamin-based strain stiffening. Thus, inhibition of topoisomerase I via camptothecin drastically suppresses nuclear blebbing by both stalling RNA Pol II and increasing chromatin-based nuclear stiffness.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> veloAgent is a scalable deep generative, spatially informed RNA-velocity framework for modeling and perturbing cell fate dynamics in tissues, which is only tangentially relevant to Origins of Life via nucleic-acid (RNA) transcriptional kinetics rather than prebiotic or early-life processes.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> RNA velocity enables inference of cell state transitions from single-cell transcriptomics by modeling transcriptional dynamics from spliced and unspliced mRNA. However, existing methods overlook spatial context and struggle to scale to large datasets, limiting insights into tissue organization and dynamic processes. We introduce veloAgent, a deep generative and agent-based framework that estimates gene- and cell-specific transcriptional kinetics while integrating spatial information through agent-based simulations of local microenvironments. By leveraging both molecular and spatial cues, veloAgent improves velocity accuracy and achieves sublinear memory scaling, enabling efficient analysis of large and multi-batch spatial datasets. A distinctive feature of veloAgent is its in silico perturbation module, which allows targeted manipulation of spatial velocity vectors to simulate regulatory interventions and predict their impact on cell fate dynamics. These capabilities position veloAgent as a scalable and versatile framework for dissecting spatially resolved cellular dynamics and guiding cell fate manipulation across diverse biological processes.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Cryo-EM and simulations reveal how the eukaryotic bridge-like lipid transporter VPS13A docks to the plasma-membrane scramblase XKR1 to deliver bulk lipids to one leaflet for subsequent scrambling and membrane growth, offering broad mechanistic context for lipid-handling in cells rather than direct origins-of-life chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In eukaryotes, bridge-like lipid-transfer proteins (BLTPs) are central in mediating vesicle-independent lipid transfer between organelles. BLTPs span the cytosolic space between organelles at contact sites, featuring hydrophobic channels for lipids to travel between membranes. How BLTPs cooperate with partner proteins to orchestrate lipid delivery remains mysterious. Here we used cryo-electron microscopy to visualize a complex comprising the prototypical BLTP VPS13A and the plasma membrane localized scramblase XKR1 at near-atomic resolution. VPS13A interacts with XKR1 via its PH-domain, priming VPS13As bridge-like lipid-transfer domain to deliver lipids directly to the cytosolic leaflet of the acceptor membrane. In molecular dynamics simulations, such arrangement allows for robust lipid transfer, accelerated by membrane properties. Newly delivered lipids can then be equilibrated between leaflets of the membrane bilayer by the scramblase, allowing for membrane growth. Mechanistic insights regarding lipid delivery by VPS13A are directly applicable to all VPS13 proteins and all BLTP family members more broadly.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This preprint identifies mitochondrial double-stranded RNA as a major endogenous immunogenic dsRNA source in ADAR1-deficient cells via a proposed mtROS-driven “Draw-and-Release” mechanism, offering RNA/mitochondrial biology insights but only tangential relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) triggers immune responses during viral infections, but self-derived dsRNA can activate similar pathways. To prevent this, the body relies on mechanisms like ADAR1, an RNA-editing enzyme essential for immune regulation. Dysfunction of ADAR1 is linked to various diseases, yet the nature and role of dsRNAs accumulating in its absence remain unclear. Here, we identify mitochondrial dsRNA (mt-dsRNA), transcribed from the mitochondrial genome, as a major contributor to the endogenous dsRNA pool in ADAR1-deficient human and murine cells. We propose a &quot;Draw-and-Release&quot; model, where ADAR1 loss increases mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), causing mt-dsRNA accumulation in the mitochondrial matrix (&quot;Draw&quot; phase) and its immune-activating release into the cytosol upon mitochondrial protein dysfunction (&quot;Release&quot; phase). This study highlights the importance of mitochondrial integrity in mitigating ADAR1-related pathologies.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Presents resolveS, a fast reference-free bioinformatics tool to infer RNA-seq library strandedness using conserved rRNA sequences, offering minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Public sequencing data repositories, such as the European Nucleotide Archive and Sequence Read Archive are vital resources for biological discovery, however their associated metadata often lacks essential experimental details, specifically the strand specificity (strandedness) of RNA-sequencing data. Accurate determination of strandedness is critical for downstream analysis, yet existing tools are often limited by computational inefficiency, complex workflows, or a reliance on high-quality, species-specific reference genomes and gene annotations. To address these limitations, we developed resolveS, a rapid, resource-efficient and user-friendly tool designed to detect RNA-sequencing strandedness without requiring organism-specific genomic resources. By leveraging the evolutionary conservation of ribosomal RNA combined with a robust statistical framework, resolveS eliminates the dependency on reference genomes. Benchmarking demonstrates that resolveS outperforms existing methods in both speed and efficiency, processing samples in under 10 seconds with a minimal memory footprint (&lt;0.5 GB). Furthermore, to enhance reproducibility and facilitate seamless integration into bioinformatics pipelines, we provide ready-to-use Singularity and Apptainer images alongside a portable executable version. Availability and ImplementationresolveS is available under the MIT license at (https://github.com/yudalang3/resolveS).

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Lysine acetylation has widespread ramifications from genetic regulatory effects to modulation of enzymatic function. With improved acetyl-lysine enrichment technologies and advances in mass spectrometer speed and sensitivity, we present a comprehensive atlas of the mouse acetylome comprising 17,952 unique lysine acetylation sites across 4,340 proteins and 15 tissues. This resource, which nearly doubles the known mouse acetyl-lysine catalog, shows at least 14% of the acetylome is shared across tissues. We focus our investigation on several acetylated proteins, including ribosomal acetylation and its potential to extend ribosomal half-life in the liver and pancreas. Additionally, we identify a novel acetylation event in the active site of carnitine O-acetyltransferase (Crat) that also mirrors tissue-specific Crat activity. By integrating these data with human pathogenic variants, we identify acetyl-lysine residues on cardiac troponin and homogentisate dioxygenase that likely mimic disease-causing mutations. This resource provides a foundational framework for investigating protein acetylation in metabolic health and disease.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Bioinformatics survey of intrinsically disordered regions in human spliceosome proteins highlights conserved, charged/RS-rich RNA–protein interaction motifs and disease-linked modification/mutation hotspots, with only indirect relevance to Origins-of-Life questions about early RNA–protein assemblies.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Introns are removed from messenger RNAs by the spliceosome, a protein-RNA machinery enriched with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Lacking stable 3D structures, IDRs can adopt diverse conformations interlacing proteins and RNAs components of the spliceosome and regulating splicing. Here we performed a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of the human spliceosome proteome revealing that many proteins contain over 40% of disordered residues. Spliceosome IDRs are mainly driven by compositional bias due to an excess of charged and RS-like sequences, with both the nature and extent of this disorder being broadly conserved evolutionarily. Additionally, these IDRs are frequent targets of post-translational modifications, especially phosphorylation, and are hotspots for cancer-associated mutations, implicated in different cancer types. Our results collectively underscore central role of IDRs in splicing regulation and disease.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This preprint demonstrates a mechanics-aware, topology-constrained design framework to engineer de novo exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs that form ring-like folds and robustly stall XRN1 despite minimal sequence similarity to natural xrRNAs, informing how RNA structure alone can encode functional stability.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mechanically active RNAs represent an emerging class of biomolecules whose function derives from resisting molecular forces. Among them, exoribonuclease-resistant RNAs (xr-RNAs) achieve this by folding into a ring-like topology that physically blocks 5 [-&gt;] 3 degra-dation. However, despite years of structural insight, the rational design of such mechanically functional RNA devices has remained elusive. Here, we describe a mechanics-aware RNA design approach that enables de novo engineering of functional xrRNAs. We first identify structural determinants of force resistance by perturbing pseudoknot architecture in a model xrRNA and quantifying resulting efficiencies in the stalling of exoribonuclease XRN1. We then implement these rules in a design framework that integrates explicit topological constraints with molecular dynamics-guided optimization. The resulting synthetic xrRNAs reproduce the ring-like architecture and stall exoribonuclease XRN1 with wild-type-like efficiency. Our top-performing constructs exhibit minimal sequence similarity to known xrRNAs and evade detection by covariance models, yet remain fully functional in vitro. Together, our results show that mechanical function can be rationally designed independent of evolutionary ancestry, laying the groundwork for the design of RNA elements that modulate decay and fine-tune the mechanical stability of engineered transcripts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Propolis, a resinous substance produced by Apis mellifera, is rich in polyphenols and flavonoids and exhibits diverse biological activities, including antioxidant and antimicrobial effects. This study aimed to characterize the chemical composition of Thai propolis and evaluate its free radical scavenging activity. Ethanolic (EEP) and aqueous (WEP) extracts were prepared and analyzed. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) identified major constituents of EEP, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, and sugars. Antioxidant activities were assessed using DPPH and hydrogen peroxide scavenging assays. EEP exhibited significantly higher radical scavenging activity than WEP, with maximum DPPH inhibition of 87.46% at 5 mg/mL. CAPE effectively scavenged superoxide and hydroxyl radicals and protected plasmid DNA from oxidative damage. These results highlight CAPE as bioactive compound contributing to the antioxidant properties of Thai propolis. Thai propolis, particularly its ethanolic extract, represents a promising natural source of antioxidants for potential applications in nutraceuticals, functional foods, and oxidative stress-related disease prevention.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) mediates the formation of biomolecular condensates, which organize cellular processes such as synaptic plasticity and stress response. The neuronal microtubule-associated protein tau undergoes LLPS under specific conditions, regulating synaptic vesicle clustering and microtubule dynamics. In vitro, tau LLPS is induced by cofactors such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) or RNA, mainly via weak multivalent electrostatic interactions. However, the molecular mechanisms governing the formation of tau LLPS, including domain specific contribution, remain unclear. In this study, we used eight single-domain antibodies (VHHs), targeting six distinct short sequences of tau, to explore the mechanisms of tau LLPS in vitro. By combining several biophysical methods, we evaluated the effect of each anti-tau VHH on tau LLPS with two main LLPS inducers, PEG (molecular crowding) and RNA (complex coacervation). With PEG as an inducer, all VHHs targeting tau enhanced tau LLPS formation, regardless of their affinity for tau. With RNA as an inducer, the effect of the VHHs was mixed: VHHs targeting the C-terminal domain promoted condensation, while VHH B1-1, which binds the proline-rich domain (PRD; including residues (221REPKKVAVVRTP232), abolished droplet formation. NMR and surface plasmon resonance confirmed 1 to 1 binding of VHH B1-1 to the PRD, and competition assays with a PRD peptide restored LLPS, demonstrating mechanistic specificity. This result underscores the importance of this region in tau LLPS formation. Our findings provide domain-resolved insights into the regulation of tau LLPS and demonstrate the potential of VHHs as tools to selectively modulate biomolecular condensates in physiological and pathological contexts.</p>

DNA unwinding proceeds through formation of a partially unwound intermediate state to a fully unwound open state. The open state forms inefficiently and collapses readily in the absence of negative supercoiling. An optimized variant, Ymu1-WFR, stabilizes formation of both the intermediate and open states, resulting in enhanced DNA cleavage in vitro and increased genome editing in vivo. These findings identify the physical basis for the observed minimal activities of natural TnpBs, revealing how stabilizing specific unwinding states enables efficient DNA targeting.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) is a nucleic acid-like heterogeneous polymer in nature. Recently, it was found to engage in liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), generating condensates as an emerging class of subcellular structures with pivotal functions in response to stimuli. As a post-translational modification catalyzed by PAR polymerases (PARPs), PAR is known to modulate many key events in cells. However, its involvement in biomolecular condensation remains elusive. Through an imaging-based screening of small molecules with diverse biological activities, we here discovered that PAR undergoes LLPS upon inhibiting proteasome in different types of cells, resulting in co-condensation of PAR with proteasome and ubiquitin chains in nucleus. This unprecedented co-condensation is dependent on PARP2 not PARP1 and requires K6-linked ubiquitylation. PAR is shown for the first time to directly interact with ubiquitin chains. Notably, stalled DNA replication forks arose from proteasome inhibition are co-localized with PAR-proteasome-ubiquitin chain condensates. By attenuating replication and stabilizing stalled replication forks, PAR-proteasome-ubiquitin chain condensates sustain genomic integrity under proteasomal stress. This work demonstrates a self-protective mechanism in stressed cells and provides fundamental understanding of PAR condensation in cell biology.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The growing research into the archaeal lipidome has uncovered a remarkable structural diversity in glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) and revealed complex membrane adaptations, especially in extreme environments. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the lipidome from the subsurface water of a CO2-rich, cold-water Geyser Andernach (Germany), using ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry methods. We detected GDGT-0, presumably derived from the dominant community member Candidatus Altiarchaeum, providing evidence for its ability to synthesize tetraethers as previously predicted from metagenomic data. Beyond the typical GDGT-0 and acyclic glycerol trialkyl glycerol tetraether (GTGT-0), we discovered novel structural analogues, here referred to as extended GDGTs and GTGTs, characterized by the asymmetrical addition of up to two isoprenoid units to only one of their hydrocarbon side chains, analogous to those found in extended archaeols. The lack of GDGT ring synthase A (GrsA) and GrsB homologs in the corresponding metagenome-assembled genome, suggests that the producing archaeon may utilize extended GDGTs as a membrane adaptation to cope with the energy-depleted conditions of the geyser environment, highlighting the adaptive flexibility of archaea to extreme physicochemical conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein trafficking between the cytoplasm and the nucleus is a fundamental process in eukaryotic cell biology. While linear nuclear localization signals (NLSs) are well-characterized, many nuclear proteins lack a predictable NLS. Here, we identify the ETS domain, a DNA-binding winged-helix fold, from ETS family transcription factors as a structure-encoded NLS. We show that ETS domains mediate nuclear import through direct recognition by multiple nuclear transport receptors, including IPO9. Cryo-electron microscopy analysis of the EHF:IPO9 complex reveals that the IPO9 wraps around the ETS domain and engages structural features throughout the winged-helix fold. Biochemical studies demonstrate that the ETS domain DNA-binding helix is critical for importin recognition and for NLS activity in mammalian cells. Comparison of IPO9 bound to EHF and the histone H2A:H2B dimer reveals distinct interaction hotspots, illustrating how IPO9 employs unique combinatorial binding surfaces to accommodate structurally diverse cargos. These findings define a new class of globular NLSs and highlight the adaptability of importins in recognizing distinct protein folds. Significance StatementNuclear import is essential for transcription factor function. However, many nuclear proteins lack recognizable nuclear localization signals (NLSs), leaving their trafficking mechanisms unresolved. Here, we identify the winged-helix DNA-binding domain of ETS transcription factors as a structure-encoded NLS shared across the ETS family of proteins. We show that multiple importins directly interact with this globular domain and define the molecular basis for cargo recognition by determining the cryo-EM structure of an importin bound to an ETS family protein. These studies establish a new class of globular NLSs and shed light on how individual importins can recognize diverse protein folds. We also provide mechanistic insight into nuclear trafficking defects that are caused by disease-linked ETS transcription factor mutations.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites are among the most frequent DNA lesions, arising thousands of times per cell each day. These AP-sites threaten genomic stability and, if left unrepaired, can lead to mutagenesis and human disease. The essential base excision repair enzyme Apurinic/Apyrimidinic Endonuclease I (APE1) initiates repair by cleaving DNA at AP-sites, yet how APE1 efficiently locates and recognizes these lesions within vast excesses of undamaged DNA has remained poorly understood. Using single-molecule imaging, we show that APE1 employs a dynamic search strategy that integrates 1D and 3D diffusion to rapidly scan DNA. On non-damaged DNA, APE1 undergoes fast diffusion, enabling efficient interrogation of large genomic regions within a single binding event. Upon encountering an AP-site, APE1 transitions from a mobile search state into a stationary, lesion-bound complex that is retained at the site of damage. Additional experiments with APE1 variants demonstrate that the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of APE1 supports 1D diffusion, whereas residue R177 stabilizes APE1 at the AP-site once recognized, and the catalytic residues D210 and E96 facilitate enzyme release after cleavage. Together, these findings define the molecular basis by which APE1 balances rapid genome surveillance with stable lesion engagement and timely release. More broadly, this work provides a mechanistic framework for how DNA repair enzymes efficiently locate and process rare lesions embedded within an excess of undamaged DNA. Significance StatementDNA repair enzymes face the formidable challenge of locating rare lesions hidden within vast stretches of undamaged DNA. The essential enzyme APE1 is tasked with identifying and initiating repair of AP-sites, a frequent DNA lesion, to maintain genome integrity. We show that APE1 overcomes this challenge by using a dynamic search mechanism that integrates rapid scanning with precise lesion recognition. Its unstructured N-terminal domain facilitates fast movement along non-damaged DNA, while specific active site residues stabilize engagement at AP-sites and release after catalysis. This coordination of diffusion, recognition, and turnover allows APE1 to efficiently survey the genome and repair AP-sites to maintain genome stability.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Background Myogenic differentiation of muscle stem cells required for skeletal muscle growth and regeneration relies on the precise spatiotemporal coordination of multiple gene-expression programs. Over the past decades, considerable progress has been made in defining the transcriptional networks that govern myogenesis. In particular, myogenic transcription factors integrate extrinsic and intrinsic cues to drive skeletal muscle development and regeneration. In contrast, post-transcriptional layers of regulation have remained comparatively underexplored. Among these, the epitranscriptome -- comprising more than 170 chemical RNA modifications -- has recently emerged as a major regulatory axis in cellular differentiation. N-methyladenosine (mA), the most abundant internal modification of mRNA, is now recognized as a key regulator of stem-cell fate decisions across multiple biological systems. By dynamically modulating RNA stability, translation, and other processing steps, mA enables precise fine-tuning of gene-expression programs in response to physiological cues. These effects are mediated through mA-binding RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), also referred to as readers, which selectively recognize methylated transcripts and translate the modification into functional cellular outcomes. Despite its central role in other tissue contexts, the contribution of mA to skeletal muscle physiology -- and particularly to human muscle stem cell biology -- remains poorly characterized. This gap represents a critical and largely unexplored frontier in muscle biology. Methods To define the epitranscriptome landscape during the myogenic differentiation of human skeletal muscle cells, we performed GLORI on proliferating and differentiated human primary myoblasts. This recently developed approach enables detection of mA at single-nucleotide resolution together with quantitative measurement of methylation stoichiometry at individual sites. mA-modified positions were mapped across the transcriptome in both cellular states and integrated with matched RNA-seq datasets data to contextualise mA features relative to transcript abundance. To place these findings in a broader context, we compared our human mA maps with previously published mouse muscle cell datasets and overlaid them with available CLIP-seq datasets of mA RNA-binding proteins. Results We identified tens of thousands of high-confidence mA sites in proliferating and differentiated human myogenic cells. While many sites were shared between states, myogenic differentiation was accompanied by epitranscriptomic remodeling, affecting both the distribution and stoichiometry of mA marks. Transcripts exhibiting differential mA regulation were enriched for pathways related to myogenic development, cytoskeletal remodeling, signalling, nucleic-acid-associated processes and energy metabolism. Joint analysis of mA site number, methylation stoichiometry, and expression levels indicated the presence of distinct mA regulatory frameworks at the transcript level. Genes associated with myogenesis and regulatory pathways were distributed across these categories, consistent with the coexistence of multiple regulatory programs during myogenic differentiation. In addition, cross-species comparisons revealed the presence of human-specific methylation patterns. Integration with published mA RNA-binding protein datasets uncovered distinct subsets of mA sites with varying binding profiles, suggesting state-dependent interpretation of mA marks. Together, these data constitute, to our knowledge, the first single-nucleotide-resolution atlas of mA methylation in human skeletal muscle, revealing a previously uncharacterized epitranscriptomic landscape and providing a foundational resource for studies of human myogenesis.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> DNA replication in multicellular organisms follows a tightly regulated spatio-temporal program. Although the mechanisms underlying this replication program remain only partially understood, studies in model systems such as Xenopus laevis have highlighted the importance of titrating low-abundance replication factors. Whole-genome duplications as a consequence of polyploidization introduce additional layers of complexity, yet comparative analyses of replication programs across closely related polyploid species are scarce. Here, we developed an interspecies in vitro replication system using X. laevis egg extracts and sperm nuclei from three Xenopus species with varying ploidy: diploid (X. tropicalis), tetraploid (X. laevis), and dodecaploid (X. eysoole). Replication in diploid X. tropicalis was faster than in tetraploid X. laevis nuclei, due to higher fork density and speed. Surprisingly, dodecaploid X. eysoole replication was also accelerated compared to tetraploid nuclei, suggesting that higher ploidy does not necessarily extend S phase. Since replication genes are highly conserved between these species, these results imply dynamic tuning of replication programs across polyploid species and shed light on the evolutionary adaptability of DNA replication in response to genome duplication.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Crystal structures of the Vibrio parahaemolyticus ToxS periplasmic domain (apo and glycocholate-bound) reveal a bile-salt–stabilized strand-swapped dimer that supports a model for bile-induced activation of the ToxRS transcriptional regulator.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The ToxRS system is a member of a two-protein transmembrane transcriptional regulator family of proteins that act as critical environmental stress sensors and regulate virulence gene expression in some bacterial pathogens. These systems are thought to operate by sensing environmental stimuli and transmitting signals through periplasmic domains to activate DNA-binding transcription factors. In Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio cholerae, the ToxRS system regulates virulence factors responsible for severe gastrointestinal symptoms in humans. ToxS has been shown to modulate the activity of its binding partner ToxR by binding bile salts, antimicrobial cholesterol metabolites secreted into the human gut. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this regulation is unclear. Here, we present the crystal structures of the V. parahaemolyticus ToxS periplasmic domain (ToxSp) with and without the bile salt glycocholate. ToxSp forms an 8-stranded broken {beta}-barrel with a central -helix and is structurally homologous to a group of chaperone proteins. Notably, the glycocholate-bound ToxSp structure forms a strand-swapped homodimer containing three bound glycocholate molecules. Modeling two ToxR periplasmic domains in complex with the glycocholate-bound ToxSp dimer provides a structure-based model for bile salt activation of the ToxRS system and suggests that ToxRS homologs may be regulated in a similar manner across diverse bacterial species.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The regulation of gene expression requires precise control of chromatin-associated complexes that respond to diverse structural and epigenetic cues. The Rpd3 Large (Rpd3L) complex is a Sin3 histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex that dynamically adapt to chromatin states to reinforce transcriptional silencing, yet the mechanisms governing the catalytic activation in chromatin context-dependent manner remain unclear. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of Rpd3L bound to both mono- and di-nucleosome substrate at near-atomic resolution, uncovering a substrate-guided allosteric activation mechanism. Rpd3L adopts an asymmetric architecture, in which the proximal catalytic module anchors the first nucleosome, while the Sin3 PAH domains engage linker DNA to reposition a second nucleosome. This spatial configuration brings the distal catalytic module into proximity with chromatin and unlocks its latent deacetylase activity. Biochemical and mass spectrometry analyses confirm that dual nucleosome engagement selectively enhances Rpd3L activity and broadens substrate specificity. Together, these findings establish a hierarchical mechanism by which Rpd3L interprets histone modifications and nucleosome organization to modulate its enzymatic output at promoter regions. Our study provides a framework for understanding higher-order chromatin repression mechanisms by chromatin-regulation complexes and co-repressors.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are toxic DNA lesions formed by the covalent attachment of proteins to DNA. Failure to resolve DPCs leads to genomic instability, premature aging, and cancer predisposition. Although multiple proteases and the 26S proteasome degrade DPCs, how these lesions are detected and marked for proteolysis remains unclear. Here, we show that poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP1/2) sense DPCs and modify them with poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) to promote repair via a SPRTN-Tdp1 axis. We discovered a Nudix homology domain (NHD) in SPRTN that mediates direct non-covalent PAR binding and is important for DPC repair. Loss of PARP1/2 activity or mutation of the SPRTN NHD leads to sustained DPCs. Single-molecule analysis revealed that SPRTN does not bind efficiently to the DPC, however after the addition of PARP1 in the presence of NAD+, SPRTN binding to the DPC was significantly increased.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are transcriptional regulators that orchestrate the canonical response to low-oxygen tension in animal cells. Vertebrates possess three HIF-a isoforms, which arose from two gene duplication events of the ancestral HIF-1a gene. Here, we examined whether the HIF gene family (HIF-1a, HIF-2a, HIF-3a, and HIF-1aN inhibitor) shows evidence of positive selection in hypoxia-tolerant reptiles (Testudines), compared evolutionary patterns within the family, and assessed the transcriptional response to hypoxia in primary cells derived from a hypoxia-tolerant (Caretta caretta) and a non-tolerant (Sceloporus occidentalis) reptile. We found that HIF-1a, HIF-2a, and HIF-1aN are highly conserved across reptiles, whereas HIF-3a is under positive selection in Testudines. We also identified multiple novel regulatory motifs unique to Testudines. Transcriptional signatures of hypoxia exposure indicated stark differences between lizards and turtles. Whereas lizard cells exhibited a canonical response to hypoxia, characterized by enriched cell-survival pathways, sea turtle cells exhibit a robust, distinctive transcriptional response involving enriched pathways related to protein synthesis, quality maintenance, and mitochondrial integrity. Surprisingly, cis-regulatory element analysis did not show HIFs as key regulators of the transcriptional response in either species. Instead, TFDP1 in lizard cells and E2F1 in sea turtle cells emerged as potential key regulators. TFDP1 regulates the cell cycle, specifically DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression, while E2F regulates DNA-damage response, apoptosis, metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis. These results suggest that the reptilian response to hypoxia is shaped by transcriptional plasticity, while highlighting key regulatory mechanisms driving hypoxic adaptation in sea turtle cells. However, positive selection of HIF-3a and novel HIF motifs suggest a combined, but yet to be uncovered, contribution of regulatory and coding sequence evolutionary mechanisms shaping hypoxia tolerance in Testudines.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> FreeTrace is a single-molecule tracking framework that models anomalous (fractional Brownian) diffusion in live-cell trajectories, improving short-trajectory reconstruction and estimating Hurst exponent–based motion subpopulations in eukaryotic chromatin/DNA-associated proteins.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single-molecule tracking (SMT) in live cells reveals how biomolecules explore crowded intracellular environments, yet most tracking software assumes Brownian motion, an approximation that fails when anomalous diffusion dominates. This leads to biased trajectory reconstruction and loss of biophysical information, particularly for the short trajectories typical of intracellular experiments. We present FreeTrace, an SMT framework that reconstructs trajectories under fractional Brownian motion (fBm), incorporating temporal correlations directly into linking with minimal input parameters. A deep neural network estimates diffusion properties (Hurst exponent H and generalised diffusion coefficient K) for individual trajectories, while an analytical ensemble estimator accurately recovers H from trajectories as short as three frames, conditions where mean-squared displacement methods fail. Benchmarking on simulated data demonstrates superior performance across motion types and densities. Applications to chromatin-bound histones, DNA repair proteins in S.c. yeast and human cells reveal biologically meaningful diffusion subpopulations, with H values consistent with polymer models and confined motion. FreeTrace bridges theoretical anomalous diffusion models and routine biological experiments.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This cell-biology preprint dissects how eukaryotic kinetochore linker CENP-T levels are maintained via coordinated stabilization of chromatin-bound pools and buffering of soluble pools, informing chromosome segregation fidelity but only tangentially relating to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Faithful chromosome segregation requires the coordinated assembly and maintenance of kinetochore complexes. However, the homeostatic mechanisms that maintain these multi-subunit assemblies remain unclear. CENP-T is a chromatin-bound linker that recruits the outer kinetochore modules via the CENP-T-W-S-X complex to form a functional kinetochore. Although CENP-T must be continuously replenished, how its steady-state levels are maintained is unknown. Here we demonstrate that CENP-T homeostasis is actively sustained by two spatially distinct pathways. Using covalent pulse-labeling, we find that CENP-T undergoes cell-cycle-coupled turnover rather than being stably inherited. In situ proximity labeling of chromatin-bound and soluble pools identifies regulators of CENP-T stability, including an unexpected role for the CENP-O complex in stabilizing soluble CENP-T. Mechanistically, CENP-S-X stabilizes chromatin-bound CENP-T through DNA-binding, whereas the CENP-O complex buffers a replenishment-competent CENP-T pool. Together, these conserved, spatially compartmentalized pathways establish an actively maintained homeostatic system that ensures robust kinetochore assembly and faithful chromosome segregation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Approximately 60% of the tumour suppressor protein BRCA1 is encoded by a single exon. Many tumours carry mutations in this exon, often resulting in exon skipping and thus a protein of a severely reduced size. Although none of the well-described protein domains of BRCA1 are encoded by this exon 11, the isoform lacking this part shows a hypomorphic activity in homologous recombination. To better understand the function of this large exon, we performed proteomic analyses to identify interaction partners via this part of the protein. Here, we report a DNA damage- and phospho-dependent interaction of TOPBP1 to the protein region of BRCA1 encoded by exon 11. Mechanistically, this interaction is required for the role of BRCA1 in end-resection during homologous recombination. In contrast, the interaction is not required for the role of TOPBP1 in ATR activation. Our data provide novel mechanistic insight into the function of this poorly characterized part of the BRCA1 protein.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Telomeres, repetitive DNA sequences at the ends of chromosomes, are increasingly studied as biomarkers of physiological stress as well as ageing processes. In ichthyology, fish scales provide valuable information regarding life history and ageing and are thus often preserved in substantial collections. This study aims to adapt a quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) method to estimate relative telomere length (RTL) from fish scales archived in such collections. Using the brown trout (Salmo trutta) as a model species, we show that archived scales contain enough DNA to perform qPCR-based RTL measurement. RTLs in scales are on average higher than in fins, however we found no significant correlation between RTL values of both tissues at the individual level. Analysing archived scales originating from the subantarctic Kerguelen Islands introduced brown trout populations, we find substantial variation in RTL between rivers, age classes and body size.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> While cap-dependent translation is the eukaryotic norm, alternative pathways enable selective protein synthesis during stress. We describe a cap-independent mechanism regulating NbRabGAP1, a host factor essential for bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) movement in Nicotiana benthamiana. The 5&#x27; untranslated region (5&#x27; UTR, 553-nt) of NbRabGAP1 contains three upstream open reading frames (uORFs) that typically hinder ribosome scanning. Using bicistronic reporter assays, we identified a functional internal ribosome entry site (IRES) within nucleotides 61-150. This IRES features a predicted stable Y-shaped RNA structure and a purine-rich R-motif. We demonstrate that NbPAB8, a poly(A)-binding protein, specifically binds this R-motif to enhance IRES-mediated translation over 2.5-fold. During BaMV infection, NbPAB8 expression is transiently upregulated, coinciding with maintained NbRabGAP1 levels despite potential repression of global cap-dependent translation. This represents a regulatory switch where viral infection triggers a PAB8-dependent IRES mechanism to sustain the vesicle trafficking machinery required for viral movement. Our findings reveal how viral stress rewires host translational control through specific RNA-protein interactions, ensuring the synthesis of critical host factors via IRES-mediated pathways. HighlightDuring bamboo mosaic virus infection, NbPAB8 binds a purine-rich IRES in the NbRabGAP1 5&#x27; UTR, bypassing global translation repression to maintain vesicle trafficking essential for viral movement.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Experimental evolution in Pseudomonas shows how compensatory mutations can enable loss of prfB (RF2) programmed frameshifting autoregulation, offering general insight into the evolvability and stability of translational regulatory mechanisms rather than direct origins-of-life chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding why some traits are maintained whereas others are repeatedly lost is a central question in evolutionary biology. Here, we address this problem through an analysis of the evolutionary dynamics of autoregulation of the prfB gene, which encodes peptide-chain release factor 2 (RF2), a key factor in bacterial translation termination. RF2 recognizes UGA and UAA stop codons and catalyzes the release of the completed polypeptide. In many species, prfB contains an internal UGA stop codon, triggering premature translation termination by RF2 itself. Complete RF2 translation depends on a +1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) event on the internal stop codon, which occurs more frequently when RF2 levels are low, resulting in autoregulation of prfB expression. While widespread, this autoregulatory mechanism has been lost in multiple bacterial lineages. We combined phylogenetics, experimental evolution and molecular genetics to investigate the evolutionary forces behind this loss. We found no significant correlation between PRF loss and stop codon usage using phylogenetically informed analyses, and PRF disruption in Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25 had no detectable fitness effect. However, engineered mutations that reduced frameshifting caused fitness defects, which were compensated by two classes of mutation: (i) mutations that impair specific ribosomal proteins, and (ii) single-nucleotide deletions in prfB that adjust the reading frame and bypass the internal stop codon. These results suggest that compensatory mutations facilitate the loss of prfB autoregulation under RF2-limiting conditions. We discuss three potential scenarios that could account for this process.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Computational framework (TRAEV) predicts how microbial metabolic traits erode or persist under adaptive evolution in specific environments, validated in engineered yeast and applied to wine-aroma traits.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In industrial applications, microbial strains undergo notable biomass expansion subjecting them to Darwinian selection. The consequent adaptive evolution may threaten the often tediously developed desired traits of the strains, such as flavor or platform chemical production. Yet, it remains unresolved how to predict the evolutionary trait robustness. Here, we propose TRAEV (Trait Robustness Against EVolution), a computational framework for in silico prediction of evolutionary trajectories and robustness of desired metabolic traits in application environments. TRAEV uses constraint-based metabolic model simulations to predict environment-dependent trait-fitness dependencies and Monte Carlo-based perturbation analysis to account for the stochasticity of adaptive evolution. First, TRAEV predicts the immediate phenotypic adaptation to the new environment, and then, the evolutionary trajectories of fitness and desired trait by sampling enzyme usage changes. From the predicted trajectories, trait robustness is quantified as two scores: Robustness Score (RS) and Trade-off Score (TS). RS and TS are the mean of a normalized desired trait and the mean of the product of normalized changes in the desired trait and in fitness, respectively, over intermediate metabolic states along the evolutionary trajectory. We validated TRAEV by demonstrating that it predicted the relative robustness of heterologous pigmentation of genetically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains in synthetic defined chemical environments aligned with experimental observations. We then further applied TRAEV to predictively assess the robustness of desired aroma generation trait in a wine must environment by multiple S. cerevisiae strains if they were developed via a laboratory selection process. Thus, we showed how TRAEV predictions could guide such strain development. TRAEV can be integrated into computational strain design workflows across microbial strains, metabolic traits, and application environments. Ultimately, model-predicted evolutionary robustness of desired traits can guide both strain and process development and help avoiding production losses and enhancing the economic attractiveness of industrial applications using microbial cells.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Conservation concerns regarding potential mineral extraction near deep-sea hydrothermal vents have emphasised the need for a better understanding of the contemporary connectivity of various vent-endemic species, accounting for the specifics of their life-history traits and habitat requirements. Rimicaris shrimps are a major component of vent communities in the Atlantic Ocean, both along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) and at the Mid-Cayman Spreading Center (MCSC). Using ddRAD sequencing, we examined the genetic differentiation of three Atlantic Rimicaris species to better understand their past and present migration pathways and the possible demographic history that led to their current distribution and ecology. Rimicaris exoculata and R. chacei inhabit the MAR and exhibit widespread gene flow along the ridge with no areas of restricted connectivity. R. hybisae occurs at the MCSC and exhibits almost no genetic difference with its congeneric from the MAR, R. chacei, despite the geographic distance between them and their contrasting ecologies and morphologies. Demographic inferences support a scenario of a very recent (less than 2000 generations) separation between MCSC and MAR shrimp populations, followed by a rapid expansion in both regions, possibly triggered by symbiotic development. Analyses further suggest recent or ongoing secondary contacts involving two-way migration, which is more pronounced from the MCSC towards the MAR. All together these results suggest that R. chacei and R. hybisae represent distinct forms of the same species, which we hereby synonymise as R. chacei, highlighting their morphological plasticity in relation to symbiosis.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Experimental evolution and genomic scans in a tiny-genome eukaryotic pest show generalism under fluctuating environments is likely polygenic and linked to stress/detox pathways, offering only indirect context for astrobiology via adaptation rather than origins-of-life mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In agricultural systems, spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments are expected to favour the evolution of generalist pests and pathogens, yet the genomic mechanisms underlying niche-breadth expansion remain poorly understood. Here, we address this gap by assembling one of the smallest known eukaryotic genomes--from the global cereal pest Aceria tosichella--and by resequencing generalist and specialist populations which evolved in the lab on constant versus fluctuating hosts. A previous study demonstrated that generalist populations retained a wider niche, including the ability to exploit a refuge host, compared to specialist populations that showed a narrowing of the ecological niche. Genomic scans identified 640 SNPs that significantly differed in frequency between treatments, including a single highly differentiated 120-kbp region containing 13 genes. Allele-frequency shifts across many SNPs in this region paralleled phenotypic divergence in the ability to utilise refuge hosts, and gene annotations suggested their roles in starvation resistance and nutrient signalling. However, experimental validation of the top candidate gene did not support its strong direct effect on survival on the refuge host, implying a more complex, likely polygenic basis for adaptation. Consistent with this interpretation, numerous significant SNPs occurred outside the focal region, with enrichment for genes involved in xenobiotic transport, detoxification pathways, and ABC transporters. Together, these results indicate that generalism in A. tosichella relies on complex molecular mechanisms that enable survival on suboptimal or refuge hosts, relying to a considerable extent on the ability to deal with stress arising, for example, from toxic compounds present in suboptimal hosts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> During early embryogenesis, the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) undergoes a dramatic form of genome reprogramming wherein specific chromosomes are selectively eliminated from somatic progenitor cells. These programmatic elimination events effectively silence all genes on these chromosomes in all somatic cells. Previous studies in lamprey and other eliminating species have shown that epigenetic silencing marks are enriched on germline-specific chromosomes during programmed elimination. These silencing marks include the histone marks H3K9me3 and H4K20me3, which are respectively deposited by KMT1A/SUV39 and KMT5/SUV420 methyltransferases. To test whether lamprey homologs of these methyltransferases contribute to deposition of silencing marks on eliminated (micronucleated) chromatin and whether these marks contribute to the highly coordinated process of DNA elimination in sea lamprey, we used Cas9 gene editing, lightsheet imaging and RNA sequencing to investigate their potential roles in DNA elimination and more generally during early development. Analysis of knockout embryos for four histone methyltransferases show that these genes contribute to the deposition of repressive histone marks on elimination micronuclei, but are not essential for programmed DNA elimination per se. Analysis of later embryogenic stages suggests that these marks may contribute to interim silencing of germline-specific chromosomes, and reveals major impacts on post-blastula survival and development.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Interbreeding between closely related lineages is a pervasive evolutionary feature across taxa1, including modern humans, who admixed with Neanderthals and other archaic hominins2,3. Identifying where gene flow between these lineages happened can shed light on ecological and adaptive contexts in which introgressed genes were acquired. However, mapping ancient hybrid zones is challenging because post-admixture population dynamics obscure their genetic signatures. Here, we determine the conditions under which spatial patterns of introgressed DNA in ancient genomes allow the inference of the geographic location of past hybridization events during population expansions. Using computational simulations, we identify the conditions under which introgression-based statistics provide informative signals about past hybridization events. We show that the mean genomic proportion of introgressed DNA, which can be readily calculated from low-coverage ancient genomes, reveals a cline that increases with distance from the population expansion source until reaching the hybrid zone boundary and persists over time. Comparison with empirical Neanderthal introgression distribution from an extended Eurasian paleogenomic dataset supports a prolonged admixture pulse extending far beyond the Levant in western Eurasia. Our findings highlight the power of paleogenomics to reconstruct the spatiotemporal dynamics of species interactions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Whole-genome analyses across pea aphid host-associated biotypes show that speciation with ongoing gene flow proceeds via clustered, polygenic barrier loci concentrated in low-recombination regions and rearrangements, with stepwise (“tipping point”) increases in divergence linked to host-specialisation genes.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding how reproductive isolation (RI) evolves in the context of gene flow is central to explaining how new species arise. Theory predicts that the accumulation of barrier loci is shaped by the interplay between divergent selection, recombination, and genomic architecture, yet empirical tests spanning multiple stages of divergence at the intraspecific level remain rare. The pea aphid complex, comprising multiple sympatric biotypes specialised on different legume hosts and spanning a continuum of RI, provides an exceptional opportunity to examine how ecological adaptation drives reproductive isolation under ongoing gene flow. Using whole-genome sequencing data from 13 sympatric European biotypes, we constructed a dense, reference-genome anchored picture of the divergence continuum that controls for genetic background and recombination landscape. Joint patterns of genetic differentiation, absolute divergence and genetic diversity, as well as recombination and introgression rates, reveal a consistent signature of divergence with gene flow and allow robust identification of barrier loci. Across the divergence gradient, RI is highly polygenic, yet barrier loci are clustered and enriched in low-recombination regions and large chromosomal rearrangements, which promote strong linkage disequilibrium and coupling among barrier effects. While genome-wide FST and the number of barrier loci gradually accumulate as divergence increases, the dynamics of differentiation within barrier loci show stepwise increases consistent with theoretical &quot;tipping points&quot; in the accumulation of RI. Barrier loci are enriched in salivary effector, detoxification and chemosensory genes, highlighting their central role in host plant specialisation and RI. These candidate genes are dynamically recruited at different stages of divergence, and some of them are shared among independent biotype comparisons, suggesting generic functional determinants of host plant specialisation and reproductive isolation acquired via parallel evolution or introgression. Our study provides a comprehensive view of the genomic architecture and evolutionary dynamics underlying speciation with gene flow, illustrating how tightly linked, polygenic architectures can facilitate adaptation and diversification in natural populations.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Reports a newly evolved toxin–antidote selfish genetic module in nematodes, suggesting sequential evolution (antidote first, then domesticated microbial-derived toxin) driven by host–pathogen conflict, informing how genetic conflict and reproductive barriers can arise.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Toxin-antidote (TA) systems are selfish genetic elements that promote their own inheritance by selectively eliminating offspring lacking the module, thereby establishing post-zygotic genetic incompatibilities between individuals and populations. Although these systems are widespread across species, their evolutionary origins remain poorly understood. Here, we report the discovery of a novel TA gene pair in the nematode Caenorhabditis nigoni. The antidote gene, Cni-shls-2, is a species-specific F-box gene that arose through recent tandem duplications. Its absence results in embryonic lethality in both C. nigoni and its hybrids with the sister species C. briggsae. This lethality is caused by a maternally deposited toxin, Cni-hlix-1, a chimeric gene formed through the fusion of host and bacterial sequences. Phylogenetic and genomic analyses reveal a sequential evolution of the TA system, in which the antidote evolved prior to the toxin. The stepwise evolution of TA and the potential microbial origin of the toxin support the hypothesis that the antidote initially evolved in response to pathogen exposure, followed by the domestication of the toxin, thereby elucidating the origins of TA formation. These findings highlight the central role of host-pathogen conflict as a driving force in the emergence of genetic incompatibilities and the evolution of reproductive barriers.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many RNA molecules function within confined environments, but the effect of confinement on RNA folding remains poorly understood. Proximity ligation experiments reveal altered long-range contacts in confined versus unconfined states, yet they do not explain how spatial constraints give rise to these differences. Here, we develop a physical modeling approach that incorporates proximity ligation data into coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to reconstruct RNA 3D structures under confinement. We test our model on the ~11 kb genome of the Zika virus, comparing the folding in virions (confined) and in cells (unconfined). We observe that the probability of contact between two regions of the genome vs. linear distance follows different scaling laws in the confined and unconfined cases, in agreement with proximity ligation experiments. We find that genome circularization -- an interaction that regulates replication in Zika -- occurs more frequently under confinement in both experiments and simulations. Our model reveals that the formation of long double-stranded stems through stacking confers local nematic liquid crystalline order to the RNA, and predicts pseudoknot topologies consistent with those seen in crystallographic structures of shorter RNAs. These results provide insight into the mechanism through which confinement alters the ensemble of 3D structures accessible to a long RNA molecule.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Indole and skatole are widespread semiochemicals mediating mosquito behaviors such as host seeking and oviposition. These cues are detected by a conserved group of odorant receptors (indolORs) first identified in mosquitoes and later found in brachyceran flies, suggesting that indolic detection may represent a broader dipteran trait. To test this, we identified and functionally characterized ten new candidate receptors from eight species spanning the dipteran phylogeny. Phylogenetic and functional analyses indicate that these receptors form a single, well-supported clade with diversified in sensitivity to indole and skatole. Comparative motif analysis revealed four conserved residues correlated with ligand preference. The previously described indole-sensitive receptor from the lepidoteran Helicoverpa armigera OR30 does not exhibit these positions and may have involved sensitivity to indole via another mechanism. These findings underscore the evolutionary trajectory of indolORs across Diptera, revealing both conservation and diversification in indolic odor detection mechanisms.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The photoprotective efficacy of natural skin-active complexes is well recognized, yet their application is often hindered by the challenge of deciphering their complex, multi-component, and multi-target mechanisms. To bridge the gap between established phenotypes and molecular mechanisms, we developed an AI-driven integrated platform that combines phytochemical profiling, network pharmacology, and deep learning-based target prediction with rigorous biophysical validation. We applied this platform to investigate RRBE, a bioactive complex refined from red rice bran extract. In vivo clinical studies confirmed that RRBE significantly accelerates the resolution of UV-induced erythema, while cellular and 3D tissue models demonstrated robust suppression of oxidative stress and DNA damage responses. To decode its material basis, the platform deconstructed RRBE into 10 distinct chemical modules. Leveraging our SCOPE-DTI deep learning model for global target prediction, we identified flavonoids (Module 1) and phenolic acids (Module 10) as the primary bioactive drivers relevant to photoprotection. These computational predictions were structurally supported by molecular docking and definitively validated in a physiological environment via Cellular Thermal Shift Assay-Mass Spectrometry (CETSA-MS). Mechanistically, RRBE functions through a synergistic polypharmacology: (1) Module 1 components, represented by procyanidin B2, target NDUFA7 to stabilize mitochondrial function and mitigate ROS; (2) Module 10 components, exemplified by caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and p-coumaric acid, engage FKBP11 and HSP90AA1 to regulate protein homeostasis and stress responses. This work not only deciphers the polypharmacological basis of RRBEs photoprotective action but also validates a scalable &quot;AI-guided, cell-validated&quot; discovery pipeline, offering a rational paradigm for uncovering the protective benefits of complex natural extracts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cytomotive filaments, a prominent class of cytoskeletal polymers comprising the actin and tubulin families, combine directional growth with monomer turnover to perform essential cellular functions. While the functional role of turnover is becoming increasingly clear, how these filaments dynamically self-assemble using a single monomer type remains an open question. Here we exploit physical modelling in combination with genetic algorithms to elucidate the design principles that drive monomer self-assembly into treadmilling filaments - polar filaments that grow on one end and shrink on the other. We first show that directional polymer growth is only possible when a structurally polar monomer changes conformation upon polymerisation, and identify three different mechanisms through which the structural polarity of a monomer can induce kinetic polarity. We then prove that to prevent filament fragmentation and promote end depolymerisation upon nucleotide hydrolysis, the conformation change of a polar monomer must involve both its interface-forming sites. Combining these results, we identify the principles required to design treadmilling monomers, and showcase the emergence of treadmilling dynamics from the bottom-up. Our work sheds light on the physical mechanisms underlying cytomotive self-assembly of biological polymers, and lays the base for the realization of essential cytoskeletal features in synthetic systems with programmable building blocks.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Transcription factors (TFs) control the rate of transcription of genetic information by binding to specific DNA sequences. The time needed for a TF to find its specific target sites is a bottleneck to the genetic response mechanism. While TF target site search is a well-studied problem, the effect of genome 3D architecture on the TF target search times is poorly understood. Here, we use accurate and cell-specific 3D structural ensembles of human chromosomes to investigate how the spatial organization of binding sites on chromosomes influences the dynamics of TFs. We use Chromatin Immuno-Precipitation data to map the position of binding sites for several TFs on chromosomal structures and simulate the dynamics of individual TF within chromosomal territories. We find that the distribution of binding sites along chromosomes cooperates with the 3D folding of the chromatin fiber to induce dynamics in which TFs tend to visit sites distributed sequentially along the genome. In this way, genome 3D architecture appears to reduce the time each TF spends in the unbound state while commuting from one target site to the other. At the same time, genome 3D architecture further reduces the flux of TFs between binding sites already well separated along the genome, effectively isolating distant clusters of binding sites. We compare the TF traffic patterns generated by the 3D structures of human chromosomes with those generated by several alternative structural models characterized by increasing randomness. Finally, we study the effect of lengthwise compaction and phase separation, known architectural features of the human genome, in TFs target search. In short, our analysis demonstrates that genome architecture regulates the traffic of TFs within chromosomal territories and reduces the time each TF spends commuting between binding sites.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> In replicated selection experiments, fatty-acid vesicle populations show an increased turbidity phenotype consistent with emergent cooperative, inheritance-like dynamics during growth/division—supporting the plausibility of pre-genetic (protocell) evolution in prebiotic chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Adaptive evolution has long been hypothesized to be possible in the absence of genetic molecules, but experimental evidence remains lacking. Fatty acid vesicles represent an intriguing model to study the emergence of prebiotic evolution, since they can spontaneously grow and divide and have been hypothesized to be capable of non-genetic inheritance. In this study we conducted multiple experiments to test whether vesicle populations can respond to artificial selection for greater turbidity and, if so, whether that response can be tied to an inheritance-like mechanism. We prepared 96 independent vesicle populations, incubated them for 24 hours and then selected half the populations to propagate into the next generation. The populations to propagate were picked either randomly ,representing drift controls, or were the populations with the greatest turbidity, representing selection. Population propagation involved resuspension, transfer into fresh buffer, feeding with an amphiphile stock, and then incubating for the next 24 hours. In three replicate experiments run for at least 10 generations, we observed consistently greater turbidity in selection lineages compared to drift, as well as a reduction in the heritability (i.e., the correlation between parent and offspring turbidities). We conducted additional experiments to evaluate whether this response to selection is caused by a simple carryover effect or reflects cooperative dynamics, where vesicles from the parental generation affect newly formed vesicles in the offspring generation. The response to selection is much lower if we omitted the resuspension step and/or if we did not feed transfers with amphiphiles but instead mixed them we pre-formed vesicles. Combined with imaging and other analyses of the resuspension and feeding process, these results suggest that cooperative vesicle dynamics occur, where a small number of intact vesicles from a parental generation alters the dynamics of new vesicle formation following food addition. Overall, this study represents the first experimental finding of a response to artificial selection in prebiotic chemistry.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Rising energy needs, the threat of climate change, and the diminishing reserves of non-renewable energy underscore the urgency for advancing alternative, sustainable, clean energy sources. Hydrogen is currently appraised as a logical, sustainable power source, with electrochemical water splitting emerging as a critical method for its production. Water oxidation, a key step in artificial photosynthesis, remains a significant challenge in the development of sustainable energy systems. Transition metal complexes have emerged as promising catalysts for this reaction due to their tunable structures and remarkable catalytic properties. Among the various factors influencing their performance, hydrogen bonding has gained increasing attention as a critical element in shaping catalytic efficiency and reaction pathways. The review explores the multifaceted role of hydrogen bonding in transition metal-based water oxidation catalysts, highlighting its impact on structural stability, proton transfer dynamics, and electronic modulation of active sites. We discuss recent advancements in understanding how hydrogen-bonding interactions influence catalytic activity and selectivity, drawing on both experimental findings and computational insights. By shedding light on the pivotal role of hydrogen bonding, this review aims to inspire innovative approaches for designing next-generation catalysts for sustainable water-splitting technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR) is a promising valorisation route to upgrade the biodiesel by-product while co-producing green hydrogen at the cathode in electrolysers. However, the working mechanism of transition-metal-based catalysts such as Ni(OH)₂ remains poorly understood. Here, we employed a multi-operando spectroelectrochemical approach combining UV–Vis optical spectroscopy, soft X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and time-resolved stepped-potential spectroscopy to investigate the active oxidising species and charge-transfer dynamics under OER and GOR conditions. We identified the NiOOH (Ni3+) as the active species for GOR, whereas the formation of higher valent NiOO (Ni4+) species is completely suppressed in the presence of glycerol. The accumulation of surface adsorbed glycerol molecules is rate-determining, (τ ~ 27.9 s at 1.47 VRHE), occuring slower than the intrinsic catalytic step of glycerol reaction ( τ ~ 3.2 s at 1.47 VRHE), which involves oxidation and bond cleavage. In contrast, OER has significantly slower kinetics (τ ~167 s at 1.47 VRHE), resulting in the dominance of GOR and suppresion of oxygen evolution in the presence of glycerol. The potential-independent production of formic acid during GOR follows an apparent first-order dependence on NiOOH concentration, suggesting continuous C-C bond cleavage activated by reactive *O species. These findings link oxidising species with charge-transfer dynamics, providing insight for the rational design of Ni-based catalysts for glycerol and other biomass-derived molecule oxidations.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> In-situ TEM reveals multistep humidity-driven swelling, deliquescence, and drying-induced salt formation in mixed phthalic acid/NaCl aerosols, improving mechanistic understanding of aerosol water uptake with only indirect relevance to origins-of-life via planetary climate/chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Atmospheric aerosol water uptake properties influence cloud formation and precipitation, atmospheric chemistry, and global climate. Atmospheric aerosols often contain organic acids and inorganic hygroscopic salts, and their internal mixing influences water uptake properties in complex and non-intuitive ways. The heterogeneous nature of aerosol ensembles necessitates nanoscale visualization of aerosol mixing state and water uptake dynamics to uncover mechanistic details. Here we demonstrate that water uptake in phthalic acid (PTA)/sodium chloride (NaCl) aerosols proceeds by PTA swelling, NaCl deliquescence, and droplet growth, while subsequent drying creates core-shell particles containing newly formed sodium phthalate salts. Lab-made individual PTA/NaCl aerosols consisted of cuboidal crystalline NaCl domains phase separated from amorphous PTA domains. Sodium ions were observed in both NaCl and PTA domains, which were separated by a ~10 nm thick interphase with distinct composition and structure. Humidity controlled in-situ TEM imaging revealed PTA/NaCl aerosols initially uptake water by adsorption and swelling of the PTA. Further increases in humidity cause NaCl deliquescence, hygroscopic droplet growth, and partial dissolution and morphology changes in the PTA. Dehumidification initially causes precipitation of an organic-rich shell followed by a polycrystalline NaCl core, yielding a distinctly different core-shell morphology compared to the as-made particles. Diffraction and elemental mapping confirm crystalline sodium acid phthalate forms following dehumidification. This work solidifies our understanding of water uptake and chemical reactions in mixed organic-inorganic atmospheric aerosols by uncovering multistep water uptake dynamics and new phase formation.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Engineering study proposing a zeolite adsorption/desorption thermal energy storage system to convert industrial low-grade waste heat into data center cooling, reducing electricity use substantially while modestly increasing net water consumption.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Data centers (DCs) represent a rapidly growing segment of electricity demand, with a substantial share of their consumption attributed to cooling needs. We propose a zeolite-based thermal energy storage (TES) system that harnesses low-grade waste heat (&lt;200 °C) from nearby industrial facilities to provide cooling for DCs. The system operates through spatially and temporally decoupled adsorption (discharging) and desorption (charging) steps: (a) industrial waste heat drives zeolite desorption, and (b) DC heat rejection facilitates water evaporation, enabling zeolite adsorption. Computational modeling of the thermodynamic cycle quantifies the electricity and water implications of the concept, showing (a) electricity savings exceeding 75% for the combined DC + industrial facility (~86% for the DC alone) relative to a benchmark configuration using a compression chiller and cooling tower, and (b) a modest increase in water consumption for the combined facility (14.8 – 23.9%), despite a reduction of 76.5 – 90.1% % in the industrial facility’s standalone water use. Geospatial analysis of existing DC and industrial facility locations shows that the two are typically in close proximity (median distance of 57 km). As a result, even when transportation energy requirements are considered, via an electrified truck, system-wide electricity savings could be notable in many scenarios (as high +45%). We discuss engineering design considerations, alternative deployment configurations, as well as geographic and coordination requirements for their widespread adoption.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Demonstrates native charge detection mass spectrometry for accurate intact mass/charge profiling of kilobase-scale mRNAs and their impurities, advancing analytical capabilities for large RNA molecules but with only indirect relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) enables direct measurement of mass and charge for individual ions and overcomes fundamental limitations of conventional electrospray mass spectrometry for large, heterogeneous biomolecules. Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) represent a particularly challenging analytical target, as transcripts often span thousands of nucleotides, exhibit substantial heterogeneity, and form higher-order oligomers that are difficult to assess using existing workflows. Here, we optimize and evaluate native CDMS for intact analysis of long mRNAs and conduct systematic comparison of positive and negative analysis polarities. Using a panel of commercially available mRNAs ranging from approximately 1,000 to 4,500 nucleotides, we demonstrate that native CDMS enables direct, and accurate mass measurement of intact mRNAs alongside various process-related impurities (truncations, dimers etc.). Collisional activation improves mass accuracy by reducing adduct heterogeneity while preserving the ability to resolve impurity populations. Across all constructs, CDMS provides quantitative access to charge distributions that scale with transcript length and respond predictably to activation, denaturation, and polarity, offering insight into ion charging behavior and charge accommodation for large RNAs. Negative polarity measurements generally access higher charge states than positive polarity, particularly for the largest transcripts, improving sensitivity and relative size discrimination, while intact mass accuracy remains comparable between polarities when appropriate ion transmission strategies are employed. Together, these results establish native CDMS as a versatile and information-rich platform for intact mRNA characterization, providing simultaneous access to mass, charge, and impurity information that complements existing analytical methods and supports emerging needs in RNA biotherapeutic development.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Germline development relies on perinuclear membraneless germ granules, yet the mechanisms underlying their assembly remain poorly understood. Here we uncover a conserved and central role for LOTUS-domain proteins in driving germ granule assembly. In C. elegans, the LOTUS-domain protein EGGD-1/MIP-1 at sub-stoichiometric levels recruits Vasa protein GLH-1 to the nuclear periphery. Acting as a catalyst, EGGD-1 modulates the ATPase cycle of GLH-1 by preferentially binding to its open conformation, enhancing its RNA binding activities, and facilitating its transition to the closed conformation. In this closed state, GLH-1 enriches mRNAs at the nuclear periphery, which enables the accumulation of RNA-binding proteins including PGL-1 and PGL-3. Using human cells, we demonstrate the LOTUS-domain protein TDRD5 similarly recruits DDX4, the human Vasa homolog, and stimulates the formation of intermitochondrial cement. Collectively, our findings reveal an evolutionarily conserved role of LOTUS-domain proteins in enhancing Vasa activity and provide a unified model for germ granule assembly across species.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Evolution over deep time is often slow relative to neutral or directional expectations. A striking example is provided by Drosophila wing shape, which shows substantial genetic variance yet comparatively little macroevolutionary change. Using a large-scale fitness assay, we find pervasive stabilizing selection across dimensions of D. melanogaster wing shape that is proportional to standing variation, driven by variance in male fitness, and likely generated by pleiotropy. Parameterizing a macroevolutionary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model using our selection estimate recapitulates observed among species variance under reasonable effective population sizes, suggesting a role for apparent stabilizing selection in constraining wing shape evolution over deep time.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Machine-learning architecture for predicting Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction yields with uncertainty calibration and attention-based interpretability, but it has no direct connection to origins-of-life chemistry or astrobiology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Accurate prediction of chemical reaction yields remains essential for accelerating synthesis optimization, yet current machine learning models face critical limitations in capturing temporal dynamics, providing calibrated uncertainty estimates, and explicitly modeling reactant-to-product transformations. Here we introduce ReactionForge, a novel Temporal Graph Network architecture specifically designed for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling yield prediction that addresses these challenges through five key innovations. First, we implement persistent temporal memory mechanisms using Gated Recurrent Units to track catalyst evolution and reagent dynamics across reaction sequences. Second, we develop cross-attention layers that explicitly compare reactant and product molecular graphs, learning which structural changes most influence reaction outcomes. Third, we incorporate hierarchical graph pooling via Self-Attention Graph Pooling to automatically discover functional group patterns. Fourth, we employ evidential deep learning to provide calibrated epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in a single forward pass. Fifth, we use multi-task learning with yield, selectivity, and reaction time as joint objectives to improve generalization. Evaluated on 5,760 Suzuki-Miyaura reactions spanning five metal catalysts and diverse substrates, ReactionForge achieves R² = 0.968 ± 0.004 (RMSE = 5.12 ± 0.18%, MAE = 3.89 ± 0.12%), representing statistically significant improvements over YieldGNN (R² = 0.957 ± 0.005, paired t-test p = 0.002) and YieldBERT (R² = 0.810 ± 0.010, p &lt; 0.001). The model provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimates (Expected Calibration Error = 0.031) that enable uncertainty-guided active learning, achieving 37% improved data efficiency over random sampling. Systematic ablation studies reveal that each architectural component contributes measurably to performance, with cross-attention and temporal memory each adding approximately ΔR² = 0.005. Interpretability analysis shows that learned attention weights successfully recover known structure-reactivity relationships, including chloride activation challenges and ligand-substrate compatibility patterns. Despite architectural complexity, ReactionForge trains 28% faster than YieldGNN. This work demonstrates that chemically motivated architectural innovations in graph neural networks can meaningfully advance reaction prediction when properly grounded in mechanistic understanding.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Hydrogen is a primordial energy carrier and industrial raw material that will play a crucial role in future energy transition and de-fossilization ambitions. Silane hydrolysis represents an underexplored approach to hydrogen generation, yet most known systems have thus far focused on noble-metal catalysis. Herein we report a highly active transition metal-free method for the production of hydrogen from (sea)water and hydrosilanes, relying on the unique combination of simple bases as catalyst, and dimethyl sulfoxide as promoting solvent, assisted by mechanistic and computational studies. Remarkably, the hydrolysis of phenylsilane achieved a turnover frequency (TOF) of 5116 min–1, far superior to existing metal-free systems (TOF ≤ 8 min–1), and even surpassing noble-metal catalysts (TOF ≤ 170 min–1). The developed method rapidly generates hydrogen directly from seawater, applying polymethylhydrosilane (PMHS), a silicon industry waste, with rates up to 70.2 molH2/gcat/h. Notably, we have demonstrated the recyclability of the solvent, and re-use of the by-products formed during PMHS hydrolysis. Thus, the polysiloxane by-products were efficiently depolymerized into functional chlorosilane monomers, which are suitable for the design of new high-value silicon polymers. These findings highlight the broader applicability and circularity of our integrated approach.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a tunable bioorthogonal proximity-labeling method on live cell surfaces via photocatalytic/enzatic tetrazine activation and s-TCO quenching control, primarily advancing chemical biology rather than origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Described is the use of photocatalytic and enzymatic activation of rapid bioorthogonal chemistry for cell surface proximity labeling. Current approaches to proximity labeling rely on the activation of reactive intermediates (e.g. carbenes, nitrenes, radicals, electrophiles) whose half-life is regulated by uncontrollable quenching by water and native biomolecules in the cell or media. Here, we describe an alternative proximity labeling approach based on the fastest variant of the bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation (k2 107 M–1s–1), where reaction half-life can be tuned by simply controlling the concentration of a strained trans-cyclooctene (s-TCO) quencher. An electrophilic s-TCO-NHS ester is initially used to pan-label the proteome prior to activation, providing a bioorthogonal handle for tagging proteins. Subsequently, antibody-photocatalyst or antibody-enzyme conjugates are targeted to CD45 on the surface of live cells and used to locally catalyze the conversion of dihydrotetrazine molecules to reactive tetrazines. Photocatalysis is achieved through brief, 20-second irradiation at 470 nm with a commercially available antibody-fluorescein conjugate, and enzymatic catalysis is achieved using a commercially available HRP-antibody conjugate. Freely diffusing s-TCO-CO2H serves as a quencher during the proximity labeling reaction, and adjusting the quencher concentration can attenuate labeling as demonstrated in vitro on a model protein. Tuning the half-life of the proximity labeling reaction was also studied in live cells and found to produce proteomic data sets with high overlap. Labeling reactions with shorter half-lives enriched fewer total proteins but maintained enrichment of known interactors. We anticipate that the use of bioorthogonal reactions to facilitate protein proximity labeling will find broad use for studying protein-protein interactions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Perspective review reframing RNA secondary-structure representations (including pseudoknots) using circuit topology to connect mathematical models with physical folding organization and kinetics, offering tools potentially useful for understanding RNA-world functional folding.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> RNA molecules fold into complex three-dimensional structures that determine their function. A wide range of mathematical frameworks, such as chord diagrams, fatgraphs, and context-free grammars, have been used to represent these structures; however, these models have largely been developed from mathematical motivations rather than from considerations of the physical principles that govern the folding, organization, and interactions of RNA molecules. In this perspective review, we reinterpret these mathematical models through the lens of circuit topology (CT), a physics-inspired approach originally developed to characterize interaction patterns in linear polymers, relate them to folding kinetics, and enable molecular design and engineering. Using CT, RNA secondary structures, including pseudoknots, can be represented compactly, revealing direct mapping between traditional RNA models and the underlying topological arrangement of interactions. This unified view highlights shared structural principles between RNA and other polymer systems and provides a common basis for exchanging methods across different areas of molecular science. Finally, we outline how the CT framework can be extended to analyze higher-order motifs such as RNA-RNA interactions, base triples, and aspects of folding kinetics. By providing a common language for analyzing the organization and function of folded biomolecular chains, CT bridges mathematical abstraction and molecular reality.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Although our synthetic efforts were directed toward cordysinin A, the reported natural product, the route ultimately delivered its diastereomer, (5S)-hydroxy-cyclo (L-Pro-L-Leu), whose total synthesis is described herein. The cyclo (L-proline-L-leucine) 2,5-diketopiperazine scaffold was prepared through standard solution-phase peptide coupling, followed by deprotection and intramolecular cyclization. Electrochemical oxidation at the proline C5 position generated an N-acyl iminium intermediate that was efficiently trapped by water to afford the corresponding 5-hydroxyproline derivative. However, detailed spectroscopic characterization of the synthetic product, together with comparison to the reported data for the natural isolate, revealed notable discrepancies, suggesting that the structure originally assigned to cordysinin A was likely incorrect. Our findings instead support a structural revision of cordysinin A to a regioisomer featuring hydroxylation at the proline C4 position rather than C5.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a photonic–electro–ionic “optical fiber membrane electrode” catalytic platform that co-localizes photons, electrons, and ions to boost multi-field catalysis (including water-splitting), with potential indirect relevance for prebiotic/Origins-of-Life reaction engineering but no direct OoL focus.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper introduces Optical Fiber Chemistry (OFC) as a fourth-generation catalytic paradigm, distinguished not by incremental improvements in catalyst materials but by a fundamental reconfiguration of the catalytic reaction platform. By employing optical fibers as active photonic control elements, OFC achieves gen- uine coplanar coupling of photons, electrons, and ions within a single membrane electrode, thereby overcoming the intrinsic spatial separation that limits conven- tional thermal catalysis, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and photoelectrochemical systems. This architecture establishes an essential physical foundation for pro- grammable chemistry and artificial intelligence–driven chemical systems. Optical Fiber Chemical Catalysis (OFC) represents the most substantial ad- vance in photo–electro and multi-field synergistic catalysis since the seminal demon- stration of photoelectrochemical water splitting by Fujishima and Honda in 1972. Here, we define the concepts of optical fiber chemistry and optical fiber chemi- cal catalysis, delineate their fundamental elements, and formulate the underlying catalytic laws. The OFC framework enables economical, safe, efficient, and high– energy-density scale-up or distributed deployment of optical fiber chemical reaction units, forming modular optical fiber chemical stacks. Moreover, the OFC platform allows chemical reaction processes to be programmably regulated and serves as a core chemical platform for artificial intelligence laboratories and intelligent chemical manufacturing. Catalytic principle: The central feature of OFC is a sandwich-structured optical-fiber membrane electrode, in which rational structural design enables the synergistic coupling of optical fields, electric fields, and proton/ion transport path- ways at a single reaction interface. Within this architecture, photons, electrons, protons, ions, catalysts, reactants, and products coexist at the same interface, allowing photonic excitation and charge separation to occur synchronously and thereby markedly enhancing catalytic efficiency. On the basis of these principles, optical fiber chemical catalysis is expected to enable key reactions—including am- monia synthesis, noble-metal-free fuel cells, organic synthesis, and pharmaceutical manufacturing—under ambient temperature and pressure. Over the next decade, OFC is anticipated to emerge as a major technological route in chemical engineering and catalysis.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding the role of intrinsic magnetic order on the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) requires careful consideration of the magnetic properties of both the catalytic surface and bulk under operating conditions. Because these often diverge from those of the pristine material, operando characterization that directly links magnetic behaviour to catalytic activity is essential. Here, we investigate the magnetic properties of La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 thin‐film OER catalysts using a combination of temperature‐dependent operando ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy (FMR), ambient‐pressure X‐ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), and operando X‐ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). A direct correlation between changes in long‐range magnetic order and OER activity, with minimal changes in the catalyst’s electronic state was observed. Non‐interacting ferromagnetic regions were found to enhance activity at temperatures just above the Curie temperature. The enhancement is further amplified when the thin film undergoes the bulk paramagnetic‐to‐ferromagnetic transition below the Curie temperature. Our results indicate that interatomic spin‐exchange interactions, occurring within ferromagnetic regions and across the ferromagnetic bulk, and between these atoms and adsorbates, dominate the observed OER enhancements, potentially augmented by short‐range spin‐polarized conduction effects. These findings highlight that local ferromagnetic order, governed by exchange interactions over a few unit cells, plays a crucial role in modulating surface reaction dynamics, offering mechanistic insight into spin‐dependent catalysis.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Presents a tunable cell-surface proximity labeling method using photocatalytic or enzymatic activation of fast tetrazine bioorthogonal ligation with an s-TCO quencher to control reaction half-life, enabling targeted proteomic mapping of protein interactions on live cells.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Described is the use of photocatalytic and enzymatic activation of rapid bioorthogonal chemistry for cell surface proximity labeling. Current approaches to proximity labeling rely on the activation of reactive intermediates (e.g. carbenes, nitrenes, radicals, electrophiles) whose half-life is regulated by uncontrollable quenching by water and native biomolecules in the cell or media. Here, we describe an alternative proximity labeling approach based on the fastest variant of the bioorthogonal tetrazine ligation (k2 107 M–1s–1), where reaction half-life can be tuned by simply controlling the concentration of a strained trans-cyclooctene (s-TCO) quencher. An electrophilic s-TCO-NHS ester is initially used to pan-label the proteome prior to activation, providing a bioorthogonal handle for tagging proteins. Subsequently, antibody-photocatalyst or antibody-enzyme conjugates are targeted to CD45 on the surface of live cells and used to locally catalyze the conversion of dihydrotetrazine molecules to reactive tetrazines. Photocatalysis is achieved through brief, 20-second irradiation at 470 nm with a commercially available antibody-fluorescein conjugate, and enzymatic catalysis is achieved using a commercially available HRP-antibody conjugate. Freely diffusing s-TCO-CO2H serves as a quencher during the proximity labeling reaction, and adjusting the quencher concentration can attenuate labeling as demonstrated in vitro on a model protein. Tuning the half-life of the proximity labeling reaction was also studied in live cells and found to produce proteomic data sets with high overlap. Labeling reactions with shorter half-lives enriched fewer total proteins but maintained enrichment of known interactors. We anticipate that the use of bioorthogonal reactions to facilitate protein proximity labeling will find broad use for studying protein-protein interactions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Develops an individual-based evolutionary model showing how vector-mediated transmission and forest management thresholds can maintain or suppress high virulence in pine wilt disease, but it is not directly related to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pathogen virulence is a central trait shaping disease dynamics and management outcomes. Classical evolutionary theory predicts that virulence should be constrained by trade-offs between transmission and host survival, often favoring intermediate optima. However, many vector-borne forest diseases exhibit persistently high virulence despite severe host mortality, challenging this expectation. Increasing evidence suggests that ecological context, particularly transmission mode, vector abundance, and spatial structure, can fundamentally reshape virulence-transmission trade-offs, biasing selection toward elevated virulence rather than attenuation. Pine wilt disease, caused by the pine wood nematode Bursaphelenchus xylophilus and transmitted by Monochamus beetles, exemplifies this paradox. Infection leads to rapid host death, yet highly virulent nematode lineages persist and spread across forest landscapes. In this system, host death directly facilitates vector reproduction by creating suitable breeding substrates, potentially reversing the classical trade-off in which host mortality constrains transmission. Why such systems remain evolutionarily trapped in high-virulence states, despite widespread host depletion, remains unresolved. Using pine wilt disease as a motivating and representative vector-borne forest pathosystem, we develop an individual-based evolutionary framework to investigate how transmission conditions and management interventions shape long-term virulence evolution. By integrating stochastic population dynamics with selection-gradient analysis, we identify the mechanisms sustaining high virulence and determine quantitative management thresholds capable of reversing selection pressures and driving durable virulence suppression.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Single-molecule tracking in living cells shows that short transcription-factor activation domains (not just DNA-binding domains) largely determine chromatin-bound fraction and residence time via coactivator interactions (e.g., p300), informing how eukaryotic gene-regulatory machinery can evolve modular control over DNA occupancy.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Transcription factors regulate gene expression with DNA-binding domains (DBDs) and activation domains. Despite evidence to the contrary, DBDs are often assumed to be the primary mediators of transcription factor (TF) interactions with DNA and chromatin. Here, we used fast single-molecule tracking of transcription factors in living cells to show that short activation domains can control the fraction of molecules bound to chromatin. Stronger activation domains have higher bound fractions and longer residence times on chromatin. Furthermore, mutations that increase activation domain strength also increase chromatin binding. This trend was consistent in four different activation domains and their mutants. This effect further held for activation domains appended to three different structural classes of DBDs. Stronger activation domains with high chromatin-bound fractions also exhibited increased binding to the p300 coactivator in proximity-assisted photoactivation experiments. Genome-wide measurements indicate these activation domains primarily control the occupancy of binding rather than the genomic location. Taken together, these results demonstrate that very short activation domains play a major role in tethering transcription factors to chromatin.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Bonobos (Pan paniscus), an endangered species, have for decades been genetically understudied, partly due to difficulties in obtaining high-quality samples. The study of their genome is important not only for understanding their evolution, but also for improving conservation efforts, including population management, diversity and inbreeding assessment, and tracking rescued individuals to combat illegal wildlife trafficking. Here, we use chromosome 21 target capture data from 156 non-invasively collected faecal samples from wild bonobos to perform a comprehensive analysis of their population structure. We confirm the existence of three previously suggested subpopulations identified here as Western, Central and Eastern bonobos which are defined by natural barriers of gene flow such as the Lomami River. By estimating levels of inbreeding, diversity and differentiation, we find support for isolation of mainly Western and Eastern populations and add information on the dispersal routes of their ancestors. We infer split times and separation of these populations and apply a genetic framework to geolocalize samples of unknown origin, showing that locations of their potential origin can be estimated with a precision of up to a median of ~50 km. Our study provides valuable insight into the evolution and population structure of bonobos and reveals how rivers act as strong barriers between populations. It also offers resources for conservation efforts and highlights the need to monitor bonobo populations more closely, in particular isolated ones.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> DNA-functionalized nanoparticles noncovalently recruit diverse enzymes and boost activity in a sequence-dependent, programmable manner, offering a nucleic-acid–based interface conceptually relevant to how biopolymer surfaces can modulate catalysis but not directly addressing prebiotic origins.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Enhancing enzyme performance without protein engineering remains a central challenge in biocatalysis. Here, we report the unusual discovery that nanoparticles densely functionalized with DNA can bind enzymes without chemical conjugation, affinity tags, or engineered recognition motifs, and substantially increase catalytic activity. This effect generalizes across multiple enzyme classes: cytochrome c and catalase exhibit ~9.4-fold and ~3.0-fold higher peroxidase activity, while carbonic anhydrase shows a ~1.6-fold increased esterase activity, underscoring the versatility of this system. Mechanistic studies indicate that enhancement is an emergent property of the three-dimensional, high-density DNA shell, with the core functioning primarily as a scaffold. Activity modulation is governed not only by DNA density and length, but also, critically, by DNA sequence, establishing sequence design as a programmable handle for tuning enzyme output. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations reveal that base-specific interactions reshape enzyme conformational flexibility and increase active-site accessibility. We further show sequence-encoded control in multienzyme systems through a DNA-programmed cascade where DNA-functionalized glucose oxidase recruits cytochrome c at the DNA interface, yielding &gt;4.8-fold higher cascade efficiency than free-enzyme mixtures. Together, these findings position DNA-functionalized nanoparticles as adaptable, sequence-programmable platforms for improving and coordinating biocatalysis, opening new routes for enzyme control in synthesis, diagnostics, and therapeutic design.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Amino acids and peptides are essential molecules that play pivotal roles in biology, medicine, and chemistry, particularly in drug design and discovery. Peptide-based drugs are increasingly favored due to their high solubility in aqueous biological systems, ease of structural modification, and the non-toxic nature of their metabolites. For most peptide drugs, the chirality of their higher structures determines both their functionality and biological activities. To date, nearly all amino acid residues in peptide structures exhibit central chirality, although axial chirality has occasionally been observed in peptides. In this study, we report the discovery of a new form of chirality, termed turbo chirality, which consists of two propeller blades and coexists alongside central chirality in amino acids and peptides. Specifically, we found that di-propeller structures in amino acids and peptides can exist in either M,M- or P,P-configurations, depending on the orientation of their chiral centers, which are controlled by (S)- and (R)-configurations, respectively. Computational studies were conducted to explore the relative energies of rotational barriers for conversion between M,M- and P,P-configurations, as well as the transition pathways between the two enantiomers, yielding results that align with our expectations. This discovery is expected to have broad implications for amino acid and peptide research, particularly in structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies of peptides and peptidomimetics. As a result, our findings are anticipated to make a significant impact across multiple disciplines, including chemistry, biomedicine, and materials science.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Simulations of optical spectra can provide key insights to aid experimental interpretation of electronic excitation phenomena. For chromophores in the condensed phase, these spectra, which incorporate the coupling between electronic excitation and molecular and solvent nuclear motions, can be simulated using excitation energies obtained from molecular dynamics simulations of the chromophore and solvent. Here, we present a hybrid scheme that exploits machine learning and physically informed spectral densities to show that as few as 25 ground and excited state energetic gradient calculations can be used to construct models that accurately predict environment-influenced vibronic coupling in optical spectra. We demonstrate our approach for the green fluorescent protein chromophore in water and the cresyl violet chromophore in methanol. We show that our hybrid approach, employing a machine learning model for the high-frequency spectral density and an ab initio parameterized Debye spectral density for the low-frequency, results in systematic improvement of the optical absorption lineshape, leading to a simple machine learning scheme that can be used for simulation of spectral densities and optical spectra.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> DNA is under constant attack by exogenous and endogenous agents that result in alkylation damage, which can lead to mutagenesis and cell death. 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II (AlkA) initiates the repair of many alkylated nucleotides in bacterial cells by cleaving the glycosidic bond connecting the damaged nucleobase to deoxyribose. However, due to the lack of a crystal structure for the enzyme with a substrate nucleotide bound in the active site, it is poorly understood how AlkA accommodates such a wide variety of substrates and there is controversy regarding the AlkA catalytic mechanism. The present study uses MD simulations to investigate AlkA interactions with DNA containing a major substrate, 3-methyladenine (3mA), and QM/MM calculations to map multiple potential pathways for 3mA excision. MD simulations reveal eight residues comprise the AlkA active site, binding the substrate through several non-specific, hydrophobic contacts. Substrate promiscuity is uncovered as likely to be further promoted by Y273, which can change conformation to modulate the binding pocket size. Despite a previous proposal that AlkA actvitity involves DNA−protein crosslink formation, QM/MM calculations suggest that catalysis proceeds through a direct hydrolysis mechanism in which D238 activates a water nucleophile that attacks at C1′ of the damaged nucleotide. Our combined MD and QM/MM approach highlights that proper D238 positioning with respect to the substrate is supported by a network of D238 interactions with the substrate, W218, and W272. The proposed mechanism is consistent with experimental kinetic, mutagenic, and structural data for AlkA, and aligns with the preferred pathway of many other monofunctional glycosylases. The insights into AlkA substrate binding and catalysis gained from this study can push forward the design of small molecule inhibitors as antibacterial agents and broaden our general understanding of DNA repair pathways, which can aid in the development of cancer therapeutics.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05095v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, affects over 50 million people worldwide, and poses significant risks, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Conventional unimodal approaches, primarily reliant on electroencephalography (EEG), face several key challenges, including low SNR, nonstationarity, inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity, portability, and real-time applicability in clinical settings. To address these issues, a comprehensive survey highlights the concept of advanced multimodal learning for epileptic seizure detection and prediction (AMLSDP). The survey presents the evolution of epileptic seizure detection (ESD) and prediction (ESP) technologies across different eras. The survey also explores the core challenges of multimodal and non-EEG-based ESD and ESP.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05177v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We explore the limitations of using imbalance dynamics as a diagnostic tool for many-body localization (MBL) and show that spatial averaging can mask important microscopic features. Focusing on the strongly disordered regime of the random-field XXZ chain, we use state-of-the-art numerical techniques (Krylov time evolution and full diagonalization) to demonstrate that site-resolved spin autocorrelators reveal a rich and complex dynamical behavior that is obscured by the imbalance observable. By analyzing the time evolution and infinite-time limits of these local probes, we reveal resonant structures and rare local instabilities within the MBL phase. These numerical findings are supported by an analytical, few-site toy model that captures the emergence of a multiple-peak structure in local magnetization histograms, which is a hallmark of local resonances. These few-body local effects provide a more detailed understanding of ergodicity-breaking dynamics, and also allow us to explain the finite-size effects of long-time imbalance, and its sensitivity to the initial conditions in quench protocols. Overall, our experimentally testable predictions highlight the necessity of a refined, site-resolved approach to fully understand the complexities of MBL and its connection to rare-region effects.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2510.06154v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The formation of gullies on Mars has often been attributed to the melting of (sub)surface water ice. However, melting-based hypotheses generally overlook key processes: (1) sublimation cooling by latent heat absorption, (2) the non-stability of ice where melting conditions can be reached, and (3) the particular microclimates of gullied slopes. Using state-of-the-art climate simulations, we reassess ice melting scenarios over the past four million years (obliquity &lt;= 35{\deg}), beyond the estimated period of gully formation. We find that the melting of opaque water snow or ice at the surface of Mars is unlikely anywhere due to sublimation cooling, while (quasi-) stable subsurface ice is typically too deep to reach melting temperatures. We propose an alternative mechanism in which seasonal CO2 frost sublimation destabilizes the regolith and brings the underlying water ice close to the surface, allowing rapid heating. Even under these optimal conditions, melting requires unrealistic assumptions. Ice containing a small amount of dust could melt via a solid-state greenhouse effect, but both its possibility and frequency in Mars&#x27; recent past remain uncertain.</p>

We show that, in the large population size limit, the impact of reproduction and selection amounts to realizing a large-deviation dynamics for the non-interacting random walk in which individuals simply explore the genome landscape due to mutations. This mapping, which holds at all times, allows us to recast transitions in the population genome distribution as dynamical phase transitions, which can then be studied using the toolbox of large-deviation theory.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Tests whether CO2-rich Martian-like atmospheres can replace argon as shielding gas for selective laser melting of 316L steel, supporting in-situ manufacturing on Mars but offering only tangential relevance to origins-of-life astrobiology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04232v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: In-space manufacturing is essential for achieving long-term planetary colonization, particularly on Mars, where material transport from Earth is both costly and logistically restrictive. Traditional subtractive manufacturing methods are highly equipment-, energy-, and material-intensive, making additive manufacturing (AM) a more practical and sustainable alternative for extraterrestrial production. Among various AM technologies, selective laser melting (SLM) stands out due to its exceptional versatility, precision, and capability to produce dense metallic parts with complex geometries. However, conventional SLM processes rely heavily on inert argon environments to prevent oxidation and ensure high-quality part formation, conditions that are difficult to reproduce on Mars. This study investigates the feasibility of using carbon dioxide (CO2), which makes up over 95% of the Martian atmosphere, as a potential substitute for argon in SLM. Single-track and two-dimensional 316L stainless steel specimens were fabricated under argon, CO2, and ambient air environments with a wide range of laser parameters to evaluate the influence of atmospheric composition on surface morphology, microstructural cohesion, and oxidation behavior. The results reveal that no single parameter controls the overall part quality; rather, a balance of parameters is essential to maintain thermal equilibrium during fabrication. Although parts produced in CO2 exhibited slightly inferior surface finish, cohesion, and oxidation resistance compared to argon, they performed significantly better than those fabricated in ambient air. These findings suggest that CO2-assisted SLM could enable sustainable in situ manufacturing on Mars and may also serve as a cost-effective alternative shielding gas for terrestrial applications.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04593v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation is a driving source of photochemistry in planetary atmospheres. Proper interpretation of atmospheric observations requires a full understanding of the radiation environment that a planet is exposed to. Using the Suborbital Imaging Spectrograph for Transition-region Irradiance from Nearby Exoplanet host stars (SISTINE) rocket-borne spectrograph, we observed the Sun-like binary system $\alpha$ Centauri AB and captured the FUV spectrum of both stars simultaneously. Our spectra cover 980--1570 {\AA}, providing the broadest FUV wavelength coverage taken in a single exposure and spanning several key stellar emission features which are important photochemical drivers. Combining the SISTINE spectrum with archival observations, model spectra, and a novel stellar activity model, we have created spectral energy distributions (SEDs) spanning 5 {\AA}--1 mm for both $\alpha$ Centauri A and B. We use the SEDs to estimate the total high-energy flux (X-ray--UV) incident on a hypothetical exoplanet orbiting $\alpha$ Centauri A. Because the incident flux varies over time due to the orbit of the stellar companion and the activity level of each star, we use the VULCAN photochemical kinetics code to estimate atmospheric chemical abundances in the case of minimum and maximum flux exposure. Our results indicate that enhanced atmospheric mass loss due to stellar binarity will likely not be an issue for future exoplanet-hunting missions such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory when searching for Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.01474v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The interactions between stars and their orbiting planets, driven by forces such as stellar radiation and gravity, play an essential role in shaping exoplanetary atmospheres and gas-rich debris discs. One way to look into the composition of these environments is to observe how they can contaminate the stellar photospheres. For that, we examine how stellar radiation pressure and gravity influence atomic species and analyse their effects across various stellar effective temperatures. Using the radiative-to-gravitational force ratio, we determined the atomic movement direction and assessed the velocity boost imparted to neutral atoms escaping from exoplanet atmospheres or debris discs. Incorporating the solar far ultraviolet/extreme ultraviolet spectrum to address flux discrepancies in the {\sc{atlas9}} model, we find that radiation affects atoms differently according to their ionisation state, with highly ionised species less affected by stellar radiation. Our results conclude that the stars most suitable for observing stellar contamination are those between 6,500 and 8,000 K, with neutral noble gases and ionised iron-peak elements as the most likely contaminants.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04746v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We study the mass-conserved reaction-diffusion system known as the wave-pinning model, which serves as a minimal framework for describing cell polarity. In this model, the interplay between reaction kinetics and slow diffusion forms a sharp interface that partitions the domain into high- and low-concentration regions. We perform a detailed asymptotic analysis and derive higher-order approximation equations governing the motion of this interface. Our results show that on a fast timescale, the interface evolves via propagating front dynamics, whereas on a slow timescale, it evolves as an area-preserving mean curvature flow. Furthermore, using the derived free boundary problem, we demonstrate that on a significantly slower timescale, an interface whose endpoints lie on the domain boundary drifts along the boundary toward regions of higher curvature. In summary, our analysis reveals that the interface dynamics in the wave-pinning model exhibit a hierarchy of three distinct timescales: wave propagation on a fast timescale, curvature-driven area-preserving evolution on a slow timescale, and motion along the boundary on a significantly slower timescale.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.17976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Stars and planets form, live, and evolve in unison. Throughout the life of a star, dusty circumstellar discs and stellar outflows influence the further evolution of both the star(s) and their orbiting planet(s). Planet-forming discs, winds of red giant branch (RGB) or asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and post-RGB/post-AGB discs are examples of such host environments where dust physics plays a key role. The physical processes that occur during each of these stages establishes how the Solar System as well as exoplanetary systems were formed, are evolving, and will eventually die. This White Paper aims to bridge the fields of stellar evolution and planet formation by peering into the dust kinematics and macrostructure formation, and its effect on planet-host interaction, in dusty environments from stellar birth to death. Near-future advancements in the 2030s will enable the detection, orbital monitoring and atmospheric/mineralogical characterisation of close-in (proto)planets across diverse stages of stellar evolution. To take full advantage of these developments by the 2040s, we should develop the capabilities required to image the varied dusty environments in which planets are entrained over their lifetime. This will enable extensive testing of current theoretical understandings - from the micro-scales of dust assembly to the deeply interlinked macro-scales of planet-host interactions - across diverse settings often too small, distant, and faint to be resolved in the next decade, simultaneously providing valuable constraints on the two-way interplay of dusty host environments and planetary formation/evolution.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05092v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This paper bridges this critical gap by providing a systematic examination of the beamforming codebook technology, i.e., precoding matrix indicator (PMI), in the 5G NR from theoretical, standardization, and implementation perspectives. We begin by introducing the background of beamforming in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and the signaling procedures for codebook-based beamforming in practical 5G systems. Then, we establish the fundamentals of regular codebooks and port-selection codebooks in 3GPP standards. Next, we provide rigorous technical analysis of 3GPP codebook evolution spanning Releases 15-18, with particular focus on: 1) We elucidate the core principles underlying codebook design, 2) provide clear physical interpretations for each symbolic variable in the codebook formulas, summarized in tabular form, and 3) offer intuitive visual illustrations to explain how codebook parameters convey information. These essential pedagogical elements are almost entirely absent in the often-obscure standardization documents. Through mathematical modeling, performance benchmarking, feedback comparisons, and scenario-dependent applicability analysis, we provide researchers and engineers with a unified understanding of beamforming codebooks in real-world systems. Furthermore, we identify future directions and other beamforming scenarios for ongoing research and development efforts. This work serves as both an informative tutorial and a guidance for future research, facilitating more effective collaboration between academia and industry in advancing wireless communication technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04484v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We present a detailed transit photometric analysis of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-12 b using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The study is based on publicly available calibrated light curves and target pixel files accessed through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) cloud infrastructure. After extracting and normalizing the photometric time series, the light curve was phase-folded using an initial ephemeris and modeled with a physical transit model to determine the system&#x27;s geometric parameters. From the transit modeling, we measure the planet-to-star radius ratio, orbital inclination, impact parameter, and transit duration. Adopting stellar parameters from the literature, we derive the planetary radius and transit depth, confirming the highly inflated nature of WASP-12 b. Individual mid-transit times were measured and used to refine the orbital ephemeris through a weighted linear fit. The resulting refined orbital period and reference epoch improve the predictive accuracy of future transit times over the TESS observational baseline. An observed-minus-calculated (O-C) analysis reveals no statistically significant transit timing variations, indicating that the timing data are consistent with a linear ephemeris within the measurement uncertainties. This work demonstrates the capability of TESS photometry to provide precise transit characterization and ephemeris refinement for well-studied exoplanet systems, and provides updated parameters that are relevant for future atmospheric and dynamical investigations of WASP-12 b.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2402.06677v5 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Quantum entanglement manifests itself in non-local correlations between the constituents of a system. In its simplest realization, a measurement on one subsystem is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple parties, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we argue that all forms of multipartite entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a physical state as it heats up, evolves in time in a large family of dynamical protocols, or as its parts become separated. We focus on the generic case where the system interacts with an environment. These results mainly follow from the geometry of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium, and a quantum spin chain. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that protects bipartite quantum correlations. However, genuinely collective fermionic entanglement disappears during typical evolution, thus sharing the same fate as in bosonic systems. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04315v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: At high eccentricities, tidal forcing excites vibrational modes within orbiting bodies known as dynamical tides. In this paper, we implement the coupled evolution of these modes with the body&#x27;s orbit in the \texttt{REBOUNDx} framework, an extension to the popular $N$-body integrator \texttt{REBOUND}. We provide a variety of test cases relevant to exoplanet dynamics and demonstrate overall agreement with prior studies of dynamical tides in the secular regime. Our implementation is readily applied to various high-eccentricity scenarios and allows for fast and accurate $N$-body investigations of astrophysical systems for which dynamical tides are relevant.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Develops an information-theoretic achievable-rate analysis and low-complexity MS-CD-MAMP receiver with optimal coding principles for coded MIMO multicarrier (OFDM/OTFS/AFDM) transmission over doubly selective wireless channels.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04433v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The integration of multicarrier modulation and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) is critical for reliable transmission of wireless signals in complex environments, which significantly improve spectrum efficiency. Existing studies have shown that popular orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) offer significant advantages over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in uncoded doubly selective channels. However, it remains uncertain whether these benefits extend to coded systems. Meanwhile, the information-theoretic limit analysis of coded MIMO multicarrier systems and the corresponding low-complexity receiver design remain unclear. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-slot cross-domain memory approximate message passing (MS-CD-MAMP) receiver as well as develops its information-theoretic (i.e., achievable rate) limit and optimal coding principle for MIMO-multicarrier modulation (e.g., OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM) systems. The proposed MS-CD-MAMP receiver can exploit not only the time domain channel sparsity for low complexity but also the corresponding symbol domain constellation constraints for performance enhancement. Meanwhile, limited by the high-dimensional complex state evolution (SE), a simplified single-input single-output variational SE is proposed to derive the achievable rate of MS-CD-MAMP and the optimal coding principle with the goal of maximizing the achievable rate. Numerical results show that coded MIMO-OFDM/OTFS/AFDM with MS-CD-MAMP achieve the same maximum achievable rate in doubly selective channels, whose finite-length performance with practical optimized low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is only 0.5 $\sim$ 1.8 dB away from the associated theoretical limit, and has 0.8 $\sim$ 4.4 dB gain over the well-designed point-to-point LDPC codes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.07220v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Recent progress in open many-body quantum systems has highlighted the importance of the Markov length, the characteristic scale over which conditional correlations decay. It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany-Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04874v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: A highly diluted aqueous solution of histamine was studied by molecular dynamics using the TIP3P and SPC/E water models. It was shown that the local structure of the solution around histamine is determined by local Coulomb interactions and hydrogen bonds and is practically independent of the choice of the water model. Dynamic analysis based on the mean square displacement functions revealed a significant dependence of the diffusion behavior of histamine on the water model. It was found that the TIP3P water model leads to overestimated values of the diffusion coefficients of water and histamine and a transition to the diffusion mode of motion. It was found that the SPC/E water model provides slower dynamics of the solution components, and the values of the diffusion coefficients are in better agreement with experimental data. It was shown that the dynamics of histamine is highly sensitive to the choice of the water model, and the SPC/E model is more suitable for the correct description of the dynamic properties of the ``histamine--water&#x27;&#x27; system under physiological conditions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a two-parameter memory-weighted velocity (fractional-derivative-like) operator for history-dependent dynamical systems, with no direct connection to origins-of-life chemistry or biology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05122v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The modeling of dynamical systems whose present state depends on their history often requires generalizations of the classical concept of a derivative. This work introduces a **memory-weighted velocity operator** \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}\) designed to quantify rates of change while incorporating time-varying, power-law memory. The operator is defined via a kernel with two independent, continuous memory exponents \(\alpha(t)\) and \(\beta(t)\), which separately weight the influence of past state increments and the scaling of elapsed time. For a function \(x\), the resulting quantity \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}[x]\) represents its memory-weighted rate of change. We establish fundamental properties of this operator, including its explicit integral representation, linearity, and a key result on the **continuous dependence** of \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}[x]\) on the exponents \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) with respect to uniform convergence. Furthermore, we examine the special **uniform-memory** case \(\alpha=\beta\equiv1\), proving that \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}[x](t)\) **asymptotically recovers** the classical derivative \(\dot{x}(0)\) as \(t \to 0^{+}\), thereby ensuring consistency with standard calculus. The analysis is supported by self-contained appendices providing necessary technical tools. The framework developed here offers a well-defined mathematical object for describing memory-dependent dynamics, with potential utility in formulating and analyzing evolution equations that feature adaptively weighted historical information.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05120v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) determines the bulk evolution and observable emission in a wide variety of high-energy astrophysical phenomena. Due to their complexity, RHD problems must usually be studied through numerical simulation. We have extended the publicly available RICH code, which previously solved the equations of RHD in the limit of grey flux-limited diffusion (FLD), to operate with a multigroup FLD solver. RICH is a semi-Lagrangian code that solves the equations of RHD on an unstructured moving mesh, and is the first multigroup RHD moving mesh code, making it uniquely applicable to problems with extreme dynamic range and dynamically important radiation forces. We validate our multigroup module against multiple analytic benchmarks, including a novel test of the RHD Doppler term. The computational efficiency of the code is aided by a novel scheme to accelerate convergence in optically thick cells. Finally, we apply multigroup RICH in a pilot study of a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), using a $10^4 M_\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole. Our simulations self-consistently produce a bright early-time X-ray flash prior to peak optical/UV light, in qualitative agreement with post-processing of (grey) RICH simulations of supermassive black hole TDEs, as well as X-ray observations of the TDE AT 2022dsb.</p>

To do so, we study evolutionary dynamics in which individuals experience mutations, reproduction, and selection using variants of the Moran model. We show that, in the large population size limit, the impact of reproduction and selection amounts to realizing a large-deviation dynamics for the non-interacting random walk in which individuals simply explore the genome landscape due to mutations. This mapping, which holds at all times, allows us to recast transitions in the population genome distribution as dynamical phase transitions, which can then be studied using the toolbox of large-deviation theory.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.09057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: By introducing an extra stack of D6-branes to standard ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, we extend the landscape of its complete search. In this construction, the $d$-stack of D6-branes is introduced besides the standard $a,~b,~c$-stacks. More intersections from the extra stacks of D6-branes appear, and thus Higgs/Higgs-like particles arise from more origins. Among these models, we find eight new classes of ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with gauge symmetries $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_{R_1}\times SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{R}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$, where $d$-stack of D6-branes carries the gauge symmetries $SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(2)_{L_2}$, respectively. The $SU(2)_{L_1/R_1} \times SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ can be broken down to the diagonal $SU(2)_{L/R}$ gauge symmetry via bifundamental Higgs fields. In such a way, we for the first time successfully constructed three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from non-rigid D6-branes with extra $d$-stacks of D6-branes as visible sectors. Interestingly, by introducing extra stack of D6-branes to the standard supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, the number of filler brane reduces in general, and eventually the models without any $USp(N)$ gauge symmetry present. This reduces the exotic particles from filler brane intersection yet provides more vector-like particles from ${\cal N}=2$ subsector that are useful in renormalization group equation evolution as an advantage. Moreover, interesting degeneracy behavior with the same gauge coupling ratio exists in certain class of models.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05031v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: When simulating three-dimensional flows interacting with deformable and elastic obstacles, current methods often encounter complexities in the governing equations and challenges in numerical implementation. In this work, we introduce a novel numerical formulation for simulating incompressible viscous flows at low Reynolds numbers in the presence of deformable interfaces. Our method employs a vorticity-stream vector formulation that significantly simplifies the fluid solver, transforming it into a set of coupled Poisson problems. The body-fluid interface is modeled using a phase field, allowing for the incorporation of various free-energy models to account for membrane bending and surface tension. In contrast to existing three-dimensional approaches, such as Lattice Boltzmann Methods or boundary-integral techniques, our formulation is lightweight and grounded in classical fluid mechanics principles, making it implementable with standard finite-difference techniques. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method by simulating the evolution of a single vesicle or droplet in Newtonian Poiseuille and Couette flows under different free-energy models, successfully recovering canonical axisymmetric shapes and stress profiles. Although this work primarily focuses on single-body dynamics in Newtonian suspending fluids, the framework can be extended to include body forces, inertial effects, and viscoelastic media.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04898v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Phase-field (PF) modeling is a powerful tool for simulating microstructure evolution. To overcome the high computational cost of PF in solving complex PDEs, machine learning methods such as PINNs, convLSTM have been used to predict PF evolution. However, current methods still face shortages of low flexibility, poor generalization and short predicting time length. In this work, we present a joint framework coupling voxel-flow network (VFN) with PF simulations in an alternating manner for long-horizon temporal prediction of microstructure evolution. The VFN iteratively predicts future evolution by learning the flow of pixels from past snapshots, with periodic boundaries preserved in the process. Periodical PF simulations suppresses nonphysical artifacts, reduces accumulated error, and extends reliable prediction time length. The VFN is about 1,000 times faster than PF simulation on GPU. In validation using grain growth and spinodal decomposition, MSE and SSIM remain 6.76% and 0.911 when predicted 18 frames from only 2 input frames, outperforming similar predicting methods. For an ultra-long grain growth prediction for 82 frames from 2 input frames, grain number decreases from 600 to 29 with NMSE of average grain area remaining 1.64%. This joint framework enables rapid, generalized, flexible and physically consistent microstructure forecasting from image-based data for ultra-long time scales.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2501.18620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: As a core element of culture, images transform perception into structured representations and undergo evolution similar to natural languages. Given that visual input accounts for 60% of human sensory experience, it is natural to ask whether images follow statistical regularities similar to those in linguistic systems. Guided by symbol-grounding theory, which posits that meaningful symbols originate from perception, we treat images as vision-centric artifacts and employ pre-trained neural networks to model visual processing. By detecting kernel activations and extracting pixels, we obtain text-like units, which reveal that these image-derived representations adhere to statistical laws such as Zipf&#x27;s, Heaps&#x27;, and Benford&#x27;s laws, analogous to linguistic data. Notably, these statistical regularities emerge spontaneously, without the need for explicit symbols or hybrid architectures. Our results indicate that connectionist networks can automatically develop structured, quasi-symbolic units through perceptual processing alone, suggesting that text- and symbol-like properties can naturally emerge from neural networks and providing a novel perspective for interpretation.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This biomedical study shows that [225Ac]Ac-FAPI-04 radionuclide therapy induces DNA damage and remodels the tumor microenvironment via IL-27/JAK-STAT activation and Tnfaip3 downregulation to enhance cytotoxic T cell immunity, but it is not relevant to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Background: Accumulating evidence substantiates the capacity of targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) to potentiate tumor immunotherapy responses. However, combining TRT and immunotherapies exhibits substantial varying efficacy, underscoring the importance of investigating mechanisms through which TRT remodels the tumor microenvironment (TME). Despite recent advancements, the specific signaling molecules mediated by TRT that regulate the functions of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) remain unclear. Methods: Given the demonstrated potential of -radionuclides targeting the fibroblast activation protein (FAP) in TRT, this study employed [225Ac]Ac-FAPI-04 to investigate the mechanisms of TRT-induced TME remodeling. The cytotoxic effects were first evaluated in the B16F10 cell line, followed by an assessment of its in vivo therapeutic efficacy in tumor-bearing mice. RNA-sequencing analysis was utilized to elucidate underlying signaling pathways involving immune responses. Results: [225Ac]Ac-FAPI-04 significantly induced DNA double-strand breaks, further elevated ROS levels, and apoptosis in tumor cells. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that [225Ac]Ac-FAPI-04 activates the IL-27/JAK-STAT pathway to amplify interferon-mediated responses, indicating IL-27 serves as a critical regulatory signal for CTLs during TRT. A concomitant observation was the downregulation of Tnfaip3 following [225Ac]Ac-FAPI-04 treatment. Tnfaip3 is implicated in modulating CTLs&#x27; behavior and intratumoral infiltration, while its downregulation was associated with the upregulation of cytotoxic effector molecules, as confirmed in this study. Conclusion: This study identifies a TRT-induced pattern of synergistic signaling mediated by IL-27 and Tnfaip3, which collectively enhances CTL recruitment and potentiates their cytotoxic function. These findings provide a detailed mechanistic rationale for strategies aimed at augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of TRT and immunotherapy combinations.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Using engineered recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae × S. paradoxus hybrids and lab evolution, the study finds hybrid fitness is shaped mainly by widespread weak, background-dependent genetic incompatibilities and compensatory adaptation rather than rare strong lethal incompatibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Species barriers limit gene flow and maintain co-adapted genomes. Interspecific hybridization can break down species barriers to reveal genetic incompatibilities. Although the phenotypic and genomic consequences of hybridization have been extensively studied in many systems, far less is known about the longer-term evolutionary dynamics of highly divergent, mosaic genomes and the extent to which genetic incompatibilities shape their adaptation. In yeast, pre-zygotic barriers are weak but post-zygotic barriers are strong due to mispairing of chromosomes during meiosis. By suppressing anti-recombination genes in meiosis, we generated a panel of 20 haploid recombinant hybrids from a cross between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its sister species, Saccharomyces paradoxus. Across conditions, these hybrids are, on average, less fit than either parent and show broad phenotypic variation. Inheritance patterns of protein complexes in the hybrid genomes reveal no evidence of pairwise lethality but do support a model of pervasive weak negative genetic interactions in hybrid protein complexes. We show by laboratory evolution that each recombinant genome follows a distinct evolutionary trajectory, and a small subset of hybrid protein complexes and loci show hybrid-specific mutational targeting. Finally, we show that species-of-origin alleles can bias evolutionary outcomes by reshaping selection on interacting genes. Together, our results suggest that strong pairwise incompatibilities are rare, while weak, background-dependent incompatibilities are widespread and shape fitness and adaptation in hybrid genomes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The 14-3-3 protein family, with over 1300 binding partners, is one of the largest regulators of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in eukaryotic cells. They recognise and bind to phosphorylation-related motifs in their partner proteins, creating scaffolds to stabilise proteins and allowing or inhibiting kinases` access to their targets. 14-3-3 consists of seven isoforms ({beta}, {gamma}, {epsilon}, {zeta}, , {theta} and {sigma}), which are expressed across all tissues. Given their important role in PPIs, their dysregulation can contribute to a variety of diseases, such as cancer or neurodegenerative disorders like Creutzfeldt-Jakob`s, Parkinson`s or Alzheimer`s diseases. Pathological effects can arise due to loss of function, aberrant interactions or protein aggregation. Notably, 14-3-3 aggregates have been detected in Lewy bodies or cerebrospinal fluid, mirroring the presence of amyloid proteins, such as -synuclein or {beta}-amyloid. Toxic amyloid aggregation signals the onset of neurodegeneration, which can occur through misfolding of proteins or liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) -- a process during which proteins condense into membraneless organelles. Unlike other amyloidogenic proteins, there is little information on the conditions under which the 14-3-3 protein family members undergo LLPS or their relationship with amyloid aggregation. To address this gap, we examined all isoforms of 14-3-3 in vitro and observed the formation of amyloid aggregates and phase-separated droplets. Our results revealed that the {epsilon} and {theta} isoforms form worm-like fibrils, and molecular crowding conditions promote phase separation in most of the 14-3-3 proteins.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Ophrys orchids (or bee orchids) provide an outstanding example of a plant adaptive radiation. Over the last five million years, this genus has diversified into hundreds of taxa as a result of its unconventional pollination strategy, known as &#x27;sexual swindling&#x27;. However, the rapid and substantial diversification of this genus, combined with its capacity for hybridisation and large genome size, poses significant challenges in addressing its systematics. We used phylotranscriptomics as a genome complexity reduction technique to infer the phylogenetic relationships among Ophrys main lineages. More than seven thousand gene trees enabled us to determine the relative contributions of gene flow and incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) in Ophrys evolution. First, we propose a new phylogenetic hypothesis for the genus with an unprecedented resolution that largely confirms the relationships between the main Ophrys lineages, but also provides new insights within each sub-genera. By combining phylogenetic network inference with introgression analyses based on gene tree topologies and branch lengths, we then show that the numerous phylogenetic incongruences among gene tree topologies result from a pervasive background of ILS, over which stand out several well-supported, ancient and potentially adaptive gene flow events between lineages. These major gene flow events provide a new perspective on the evolution of the Ophrys genus and its pollination, questioning previous hypotheses inferred without considering its reticulate evolution, and providing a better understanding of discrepancies observed among previous phylogenetic studies of the genus.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding how transcriptional output and chromatin accessibility coordinate across cellular states remains a central challenge in multimodal single-cell biology. Here, we establish explicit hierarchical empirical bounds on RNA-chromatin statistical dependence using a strictly falsification-driven, information-theoretic analysis of paired RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. Our contribution is not to assert universal coupling, but to quantify the maximum intra-state coupling that survives adversarial nulls, thereby converting qualitative intuition into empirical bounds. Leveraging unimodal latent representations and adversarial null models, we quantify both the existence and the limits of cross-modal dependence across organizational scales. At the population level, global RNA-ATAC mutual information is strong and reproducible across donors, but is shown to be overwhelmingly dominated by cell-type composition rather than fine-grained regulatory coordination. When cellular state is explicitly controlled, intra-state RNA-ATAC coupling collapses to null expectations in the majority of populations, directly falsifying the hypothesis of a universal within-state regulatory channel. Despite this collapse, a weak but statistically robust residual coupling persists in a restricted subset of highly dynamic states, including erythroid differentiation compartments, activated T cells, and NK cells. This residual signal survives stringent local permutation tests and conditional mutual information analysis, demonstrating that it cannot be reduced to compositional mixing alone. Quantitatively, residual within-state dependence is consistently an order of magnitude smaller than global dependence, placing an empirical upper bound on within-state RNA-ATAC coordination in this dataset. Donor-resolved ratios rho = I(R;A|S)/I(R;A) indicate that most of the global dependence is removed by conditioning on state; operationally, we refer to the removed fraction (1 - rho) as composition-dominated dependence. Throughout, &quot;state-contingent statistical dependence&quot; is used strictly as an operational descriptor rather than a causal claim: mutual information and conditional mutual information quantify statistical dependence only, not directionality or mechanism. This framing constrains downstream mechanistic interpretation and future multimodal modeling.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> DeepKOALA is a fast GRU-based deep learning tool for KEGG Orthology assignment that accelerates large-scale DNA/protein functional annotation but is only indirectly relevant to origins-of-life research as a general bioinformatics enabler.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The KEGG Orthology (KO) system links DNA and protein sequences to biological functions and pathways, providing a curated, fundamental and consistent annotation framework across all domains of life. While accurate, traditional sequence alignment-based annotation methods are computationally expensive, which severely limits their application in large-scale datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce DeepKOALA, a deep learning approach based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), which frames KO annotation as an open-set recognition task. This design reduces false positives arising from out-of-scope sequences and, together with a lightweight GRU backbone, enables high-throughput annotation. The GRU-based model was benchmarked against four other deep learning architectures and showed the best balance between speed and accuracy. We further performed a cross-species evaluation of DeepKOALA in comparison with existing KO annotation tools, where it achieved an F1-score of 0.8653 and 37.5-fold acceleration compared with BlastKOALA. We also provide a specialized fragment model for handling incomplete sequences and an optional Multi-domain mode. Together, these features make DeepKOALA a scalable, efficient, and accurate solution for high-throughput function annotation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spatial organization of transcription machinery is emerging as a key regulator of gene expression, yet how RNA polymerases are organized at gene clusters remains unclear. Here, we show that RNA polymerases II and polymerase III form distinct nuclear foci at the 5S ribosomal DNA (rDNA)-Spliced leader 1 (SL1) cluster in C. elegans. Within this cluster, polymerase II binds to the SL1 gene, while polymerase III associates with 5S rDNA. Both polymerase foci display dynamic but distinct behaviors within the nucleus. The assembly of these polymerase foci is regulated across the cell cycle. ATTF-6, an AT-hook transcription factor, is essential for polymerases II foci formation but dispensable for polymerases III foci. While Pol III foci are largely resistant to temperature changes, Pol II foci are temperature-sensitive, and their dissolution correlates with reduced SL1 expression. Together, these results reveal a spatial and temporal regulation of two RNA polymerases that organize gene cluster transcription.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Proposes a Bayesian circuit–Hamiltonian “Gated Quantum Resonator” formalism to model catalysis and tunneling/coherence effects in complex reactive systems, offering a potentially useful (but indirect) theoretical tool for origins-of-life chemistry via improved mechanistic discrimination without explicit long-timescale MD/QM-MM trajectories.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Molecular dynamics (MD) and hybrid quantum–classical (QM/MM) methods provide powerful tools for simulating chemical and biological systems, yet their application to long-timescale, strongly coupled processes remains limited by non-integrability, chaotic sensitivity, and extreme time-scale separation. These limitations motivate complementary formalisms that emphasize structure, constraint, and evidence integration over brute-force trajectory resolution. Here we introduce the Gated Quantum Resonator (GQR) framework, a Bayesian circuit–Hamiltonian formalism in which reactive coordinates are modeled as coupled vibronic–electronic resonators with gateable interactions. Linearization around operating points maps the effective Hamiltonian onto electrical network analogues, enabling transparent parameterization and rapid Bayesian updating from spectroscopic and mechanistic evidence. The framework provides a unified language for describing non-Arrhenius kinetics, tunnelling assisted by constrained vibronic coherence, and mode-selective transport in open quantum systems. Without resolving full many-body trajectories, GQR identifies protected dynamical subspaces in which coherent evolution can persist under environmental coupling. This formulation is applicable across enzymatic catalysis, heterogeneous and electrocatalytic systems, and radiative phenomena, offering a tractable complement to conventional simulation approaches for hypothesis generation, model reduction, and mechanistic discrimination.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Reports a minimalist nucleolin-derived peptide that selectively binds and stabilizes the otherwise unstable RNA i-motif at higher pH, highlighting plausible peptide–RNA recognition mechanisms relevant to early nucleic-acid structural regulation.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Folded RNA structures are increasingly being recognised as key regulators in biological processes, yet the RNA i-motif remains poorly characterised due to its low stability and lack of selective molecular probes. Here, we describe the first small molecule – a short peptide – that binds the elusive RNA i-motif. Our minimalist peptide RGGFGGRGG is derived from the intrinsically disordered region of the protein Nucleolin and binds to folded RNA over DNA with &gt;5x selectivity. The binding of two peptide molecules folds the RNA i-motif at a higher pH than under native conditions. This folded, peptide-bound structure can still bind other guests, such as the intercalator thiazole orange, displaying heteroallosteric properties. Our peptide binding is driven by more than simple electrostatic attraction, exploiting the subtle differences in steric complementarity and hydration of the compact RNA structures relative to DNA congeners and unfolded strands. Our findings underline the potential of minimalistic peptide scaffolds as selective binders for non-canonical RNA structures, allowing for the probing and modulation of RNA topologies.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Cronin and Walker extend assembly theory to quantify “material causation” via an assembly index and copy number, proposing a selection threshold in assembly space that operationally demarcates life and open-ended evolution as persistent, high-assembly structures.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Leroy Cronin, Sara I. Walker Assembly theory (AT) introduces a concept of causation as a material property, constitutive of a metrology of evolution and selection. The physical scale for causation is quantified with the assembly index, defined as the minimum number of steps necessary for a distinguishable object to exist, where steps are assembled recursively. Observing countable copies of high assembly index objects indicates that a mechanism to produce them is persistent, such that the object&#x27;s environment builds a memory that traps causation within a contingent chain. Copy number and assembly index underlie the standardized metrology for detecting causation (assembly index), and evidence of contingency (copy number). Together, these allow the precise definition of a selective threshold in assembly space, understood as the set of all causal possibilities. This threshold demarcates life (and its derivative agential, intelligent and technological forms) as structures with persistent copies beyond the threshold. In introducing a fundamental concept of material causation to explain and measure life, AT represents a departure from prior theories of causation, such as interventional ones, which have so far proven incompatible with fundamental physics. We discuss how AT&#x27;s concept of causation provides the foundation for a theory of physics where novelty, contingency and the potential for open-endedness are fundamental, and determinism is emergent along assembled lineages.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chirality can arise through supramolecular curvature that resolves geometric frustrations in the packing of bent, achiral molecular or colloidal building blocks. Here, we leverage orthogonal protection-deprotection click chemistry to create sequence-defined mesogenic heterodimers exhibiting emergent chirality. We compare the hierarchical self-assembly of the synthesized asymmetric, achiral heterodimers which differ only in the position of a methyl substituent. Both dimers form chiral spherulites composed of nanocylinders. However, the detailed arrangement of nanocylinders depends on the position of the methyl substituent and the crystallization conditions. Despite the chemical similarity, in one dimer, two crystalline forms exhibit optical rotation indicating the presence of chiral domains, while the crystalline phase of the other dimer does not exhibit optical rotation yet adopts a chiral assembly of nanocylinders. We propose that differences in nanocylinder arrangements may arise from changes in nanocylinder curvature and dimensions dictated by the methyl substituent position, inducing these divergent spontaneously chiral behaviors. These results highlight the role of sequence and molecular design in directing the bottom-up hierarchical self-assembly and chirality of mesogenic systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03399v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: A multifractal model is used to analyze neutron evolution within a reactor. For chain reactions, various characteristics of multifractal neutron behavior have been determined. These include the dimension of the multifractal carrier, information and correlation dimensions, the entropy of the fractal set, maximum and minimum dimension values, and the multifractal spectrum function. The geometric features of a multifractal allow for the description of a stochastic system consisting of hierarchically subordinate statistical ensembles, which are characterized by Cayley trees. A stationary distribution over hierarchical levels is established, which follows the Tsallis power law. The text also points out some potential applications of fractal patterns in nuclear reactor theory. The chance of percolation, which is when we see a state in the Bethe lattice where there&#x27;s at least one continuous path through neighboring conducting nodes all the way across, is similar to the likelihood of a self-sustaining fission chain reaction happening. When this probability hits a critical point, we get a (conditionally) infinite cluster of neutrons forming. The percolation probability, influenced by how long the reactor has been running and its size, is linked to the reactor&#x27;s criticality. We take a look at how the neutron multiplication factor behaves over time. We especially focus on the early stages of a self-sustaining nuclear fission chain reaction. We also highlight the ways to identify the boundaries of the critical region.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2504.20576v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We consider a Klein-Gordon-Wave system, describing the evolution of a massive field and a massless one interacting through a Yukawa-like coupling, and we explicitly derive its Hamiltonian normal form to first and second order. To the first-order approximation, the normal form results in a Schr\&quot;odinger-Wave system, which reduces to the Schr\&quot;odinger-Poisson one in the singular limit of vanishing perturbative parameter. The second-order approximation provides the successive corrections to the Schr\&quot;odinger-Wave system, and is presented in order to show that higher-order approximations to all orders can be obtained by iterating our constructive procedure. The normal form technique adopted here formally extends the standard Birkhoff normal form procedure for harmonic oscillators to include a set of free particles in the unperturbed problem. The mathematical result obtained here might explain, for example, the &quot;cooling&quot; process of ultra-light dark matter, the approximate validity of the Schr\&quot;odinger-Poisson system describing its dynamics and the long term conservation of the total dark matter mass.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03335v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to evolve solutions to problems in many domains, in a process inspired by biological evolution. However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called &quot;Red Queen&quot; dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03408v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: With the arrival of JWST observations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, it is timely to reassess the contribution of tidal heating to their heat budget. JWST thermal phase curves could reveal endogenic heating through an anomalously high nightside temperature, providing an opportunity to estimate tidal heating. In this study, we revisit the tidal heating of these planets and propose a simple method to compute the tidal heating profile across a broad range of parameters. Our approach leverages a known formulation for synchronously rotating planets on low-eccentricity orbits and the fact that the profile shape depends solely on internal structure. We calculate the tidal heating contributions for all T-1 planets, with a particular focus on the impact of internal structure and eccentricity uncertainties on their total heat budget. Although the masses and radii of these planets are well constrained, degeneracies remain in their internal structure and composition. For volatile-poor planets of silicate-rock compositions, we investigate the role of core iron content by exploring a range of core sizes. For each structure, we compute the degree-two gravitational Love number, $k_2$, and the corresponding tidal heating profiles. We assume sub-solidus temperatures profiles that are decoupled from interior heat production, which means our estimates are conservative and likely represent minimum values. We find that the tidal heat flux for T-1b and c can exceed Io&#x27;s heat flux, with uncertainties primarily driven by eccentricity. These high fluxes may be detectable with JWST. For T-1f to g, the tidal flux remains below Earth&#x27;s geothermal flux, suggesting that tidal heating is unlikely to be the dominant energy source. For planets d and e, however, tidal heating likely dominates their heat budget, potentially driving intense volcanic and tectonic activity, which could enhance their habitability prospects.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.18429v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: This study is motivated by a robustness issue in numerical optimization of bound-constrained problems: many algorithms that perform well on a particular benchmark suite, such as the IEEE CEC2017 problems, struggle to maintain the same level of performance when applied to other suites that differ in dimensionality, landscape complexity, or the maximum number of function evaluations ($N_{\text{max}}$). To address this, we propose the Adaptive Restart-Refine Differential Evolution (ARRDE) algorithm, a new variant of Differential Evolution (DE). ARRDE builds upon the LSHADE algorithm, incorporates key mechanisms from jSO, and introduces a nonlinear population-size reduction strategy combined with an adaptive restart-refine mechanism. We evaluate ARRDE on five benchmark suites (CEC2011, CEC2017, CEC2019, CEC2020, and CEC2022) which, to the best of our knowledge, constitutes the most extensive experimental study to date in the context of algorithmic comparison, as most prior works consider only one or two suites. This broad evaluation enables a rigorous assessment of generalization across markedly different problem characteristics. To further support fair cross-suite comparisons, we also introduce a bounded accuracy-based scoring metric derived from relative error. Using both rank-based and accuracy-based metrics, and comparing against algorithms that perform strongly on CEC2017 (e.g., jSO and LSHADE-cnEpSin) as well as those that excel on CEC2020 (e.g., j2020 and NLSHADE-RSP), ARRDE consistently demonstrates top-tier performance, ranking first across all benchmark suites considered. These results highlight ARRDE&#x27;s robustness and its superior generalization capability.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> N-body simulations propose a two-reservoir inner Solar System where a sweeping secular resonance compacts and migrates oxidized planetesimals, forming Mars and delivering more oxidized material to proto-Earth while reproducing inner-system oxidation/isotopic gradients.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04032v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The models that most successfully reproduce the orbital architecture of the Solar System terrestrial planets start from a narrow annulus of material that grows into embryos and then planets. However, it is not clear how this ring model can be made consistent with the chemical structure of the inner Solar System, which shows a reduced-to-oxidized gradient from Mercury to Mars and a parallel gradient in the asteroid belt. We propose that there were two primary reservoirs in the early inner Solar System: a narrow, refractory enriched ring inside of 1 au, and a less massive, extended planetesimal disk outside of 1 au with oxidation states ranging from enstatite chondrites to ordinary chondrites. We show through a suite of N-body simulations that an inwardly sweeping secular resonance, caused by aerodynamic drag and perturbations from a mean-motion resonant Jupiter and Saturn, gathers the outer planetesimal disk into a narrow ring that migrates radially, forms Mars, and contributes oxidized material to proto-Earth. Remaining unaccreted planetesimals can be implanted into the asteroid belt as the parent bodies of aubrites and non-carbonaceous iron meteorites, while the most reduced material is not implanted and thus unsampled in the meteorite collection. This model explains the oxidation and isotopic gradients within the inner Solar System within the context of a low-viscosity, magnetic wind-driven disk.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Provides new THz–mid-IR optical constants for N₂ ice to improve radiative-transfer and snowline/disk-mass modeling in protoplanetary disks, indirectly informing volatile inventories relevant to habitable planet formation.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03951v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Context. Understanding the optical properties of astrophysical ices is crucial for modeling dust continuum emission and radiative transfer in cold, dense interstellar environments. Molecular nitrogen (N$_2$), a major nitrogen reservoir in protoplanetary disks, plays a key role in nitrogen chemistry, yet the lack of direct terahertz (THz)--infrared (IR) optical constants for N$_2$ ice introduces uncertainties in radiative transfer models, snowline locations, and disk mass estimates. Aims. We present direct measurements of the optical properties of N$_2$ ice over a broad THz--IR spectral range using terahertz pulsed spectroscopy (TPS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and comparison with literature data. Methods. N$_2$ ice was grown at cryogenic temperatures by gas-phase deposition onto a cold silicon window. The THz complex refractive index was directly reconstructed from TPS data, while the IR response was derived from FTIR measurements using Kramers--Kronig relations. The optical response was parameterized with a Lorentz dielectric model and validated by DFT calculations. Results. The complex refractive index of N$_2$ ice is quantified from $\nu = 0.3$--$16$~THz ($\lambda = 1$~mm--$18.75~\mu$m). Resonant absorption peaks at $\nu_\mathrm{L} = 1.47$ and $2.13$~THz with damping constants $\gamma_\mathrm{L} = 0.03$ and $0.22$~THz are attributed to optically active phonons of the $\alpha$-N$_2$ crystal. Conclusions. We provide a complete set of the THz--IR optical constants for \ce{N2} ice by combining TPS and FTIR spectroscopy. Our results have implications for future observational and modeling studies of protoplanetary disk evolution and planet formation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03932v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Planets with masses between Earth and Neptune often have radii that imply the presence of volatiles, suggesting that water may be abundant in their interiors. However, directly observing the precise water mass fraction and water distribution remains unfeasible. In our study, we employ an internal structure code MAGRATHEA to model planets with high water content and explore potential interior distributions. Departing from traditional assumptions of a layered structure, we determine water and rock distribution based on water-rock miscibility criteria. We model {wet planets} with an iron core and a homogeneous mixture of rock and water above it. At the outer regions of the planet, the pressure and temperature are below the rock-water miscibility point (the second critical point), causing the segregation of water and rock. Consequently, a shell of water is formed in the outermost layers. By considering the water-rock miscibility and the vapor state of water, our approach highlights the uncertainty in estimating the water mass fraction of detected exoplanets.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03963v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how external photo-evaporation influences the formation, dynamical evolution and the resultant planetary architecture of multi-planet systems born in stellar clusters. We use a model of N-body simulations of multiple planet formation via pebble accretion coupled with a 1-D viscous disc subject to external photo-evaporation. We found that external photo-evaporation reduces the planet growth by reducing the pebble mass reservoir in discs containing multiple planetary embryos across a wide range of disc masses, and is particularly effective in suppressing planet growth in less initially massive discs (&lt; 0.1 M$_{\odot}$). However, in more initially massive ($\geq$ 0.1 M$_{\oplus}$) discs planets lost due to planet-planet interactions dominate the outcome for final resultant total planet mass, masking the effects of external photo-evaporation in curbing the planet mass growth. In terms of the final resulting planetary architectures, the signature of external photo-evaporation is visible in less massive (&lt; 0.1 M$_{\odot}$) discs, with fewer numbers and lower masses of planets surviving in discs irradiated with stronger external FUV radiation. External photo-evaporation also leaves a signature for the wide orbit (&gt; 10 au) terrestrial planets (0.1 - 1 M$_{\oplus}$), with fewer planets populating this region for stronger FUV field. Finally, the 1st-order resonant pairs fraction decreases with stronger FUV radiation, although the resonant pairs occur rarely regardless of the FUV radiation environment, due to the small number of planets that survive gravitational encounters.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03990v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We analyse the association between the NEAs 2021 PH27 and 2025 GN1, which share similar heliocentric Keplerian elements and the same taxonomic classification. First, we confirm the spectral similarity by getting independent colours measurements of 2025 GN1 and confirming that they are both X-type. From numerical integration of the orbits up to 100 kyr in the past, taking into account relativistic corrections, we found that the two asteroids experienced five similar flybys with Venus, but none of them were closer than the Roche limit. The perihelion distance also reached values between 0.1 and 0.08 au about 17/21 kyr and 45/48 kyr ago, but still well outside the Roche limit with the Sun. So, the origin of the pair by tidal disruption of a progenitor rubble-pile asteroid appears unlikely. On the other hand, we found periods lasting several thousand years where the perihelion was below 0.1 au, and this can lead to thermal fracturing of the surface. We found that the rotation period of the primary and the mass ratio secondary/primary make the pair indistinguishable from the binary systems known among the NEAs, and the YORP effect can double the rotation period of 2021 PH27 in $150 \pm 50$ kyr. So it is plausible that the pair was formed by the rotational disintegration of a rubble-pile asteroid due to anisotropic gas emission or the YORP effect, which formed a binary system that later dissolved due to the internal dynamics of the pair. We are unable to give a value for the separation age; we can only say that it occurred more than 10.5 kyr ago and may have occurred between 17/21 kyr ago during the last and longer phase of lower perihelion distance. In this scenario, little meteoroids released in space due to the fragmentation event are still near the pair&#x27;s orbit and can generate a meteor shower in Venus&#x27; atmosphere.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03350v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The context of the Sun in the galactic neighborhood is not well understood, especially when we compare its physical properties to those of nearby stars. Thereby, we still cannot fully comprehend whether or not the Sun is a typical star. This work aims to identify and characterize stars aligned with the solar evolutionary track that could represent it at the ZAMS and subgiant stages. We performed a spectroscopic analysis of 18 photometrically selected candidates using high-resolution and high-SNR spectra as well as the classical spectroscopic method, based on the excitation and ionization equilibria of Fe I and Fe II lines. Additionally, we derived evolutionary parameters using isochrones, and kinematic parameters. We also estimated chromospheric activity levels and performed age estimates through 3 additional independent methods: activity-age relations using the Ca II H $\&amp;$ K and H$\alpha$ lines, and rotation periods estimated from TESS light curves. We identified three candidates that provide a good match to the Sun at $\approx$ 0.5 Gyr (HD 13531 and HD 61033) and subgiant (HD 148577) stages. Moreover, HD 197210 could be of interest when studying the Sun at $\approx$ 2 Gyr, when the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere started having a significant amount of oxygen. Our selection method was successful and we were able to identify stars similar to the Sun at different evolutionary stages, which is essential for future research in the search of exoplanets and understand habitability, especially with the advent of the next generation of exoplanet-hunting instruments.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.23542v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Surviving rapid inward orbital migration is a crucial aspect of formation models for the Jupiter&#x27;s Galilean moons. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the orbital migration of the Galilean moons by incorporating self-consistent solid dynamics in circumjovian disk models. We perform two-fluid simulations using the FARGO3D code on a 2D polar grid. The simulations model a satellite with the mass of a proto-moon, Europa, or Ganymede interacting with a circumjovian disk. The dust component, coupled to the gas via a drag force, is characterized by the dust-to-gas mass ratio ($\epsilon$) and the Stokes number ($T_s$). The effect of solids fundamentally alter the satellites&#x27; evolution. We identify a vast parameter space where migration is slowed, halted, robustly reversed -leading to outward migration-, or significantly accelerated inward. The migration rate is dependent on satellite mass, providing a natural source of differential migration. Solid dynamics provides a robust and self-consistent mechanism that fundamentally alters the migration of the Galilean moons, potentially addressing the long-standing migration catastrophe. This mechanism critically affects the survival of satellites and could offer a viable physical process to explain the establishment of resonances through differential migration. These findings establish that solid torques are a critical, non-negligible factor in shaping the final architecture of satellite systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04091v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The earliest stages of disk formation and dust evolution during the protostellar phase remain poorly constrained. Millimeter dust emission and its polarization provide key insights into the physical processes and material distribution at the envelope-disk interface. We present ALMA polarimetric observations at 1.4 mm and 3 mm of two young stellar objects in Taurus, IRAS 04166+2706 (K04166) and IRAS 04169+2702 (K04169), probing scales from 25 au to 3000 au. We model the Stokes I emission to separate disk and envelope contributions and analyze the polarization properties to identify the dominant polarization mechanisms. K04166 shows extended Stokes I and polarized emission tracing a tentative hourglass magnetic field morphology in its envelope. In the inner envelope and disk (&lt; 100 au), the properties of the polarized emission change, suggesting either a toroidal magnetic field or the presence of large grains. In contrast, K04169 exhibits compact Stokes I and polarized emission consistent with self-scattering from the disk. Both disks are extremely compact, but only K04166 retains a substantial envelope. Our multiscale ALMA polarimetric observations reveal a transition from magnetically aligned grains in envelopes to self-scattering in disks within the transition region of 20-50 au. These results provide important clues on dust grain growth and magnetic field morphology at the disk-envelope scales. Despite being embedded in the same filament, the two sources display striking differences, indicating that K04166 is a young embedded object with a substantial envelope threaded by relatively organized magnetic fields. Meanwhile, K04169 is more evolved, likely to be a young T-Tauri star. However, in both disks, the presence of large grains already suggests a scenario of early dust evolution in disks of the Class 0 stage.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.16056v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Gravitational scattering of small bodies (planetesimals) by a planet remains a fundamental problem in celestial mechanics. It is traditionally modeled within the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP), where individual particle trajectories are obtained via numerical integrations. Here, we use {\&quot;O}pik&#x27;s close-encounter framework to study the random walk of the orbital energy $x$ for an ensemble of test particles on planet-crossing orbits. We show that the evolution of each particle&#x27;s orbital elements $(a, e, i)$ is fully encapsulated by the 3D rotation of the relative velocity vector $\bm{U}_\infty$, whose magnitude remains constant. Consequently, the system can be reduced to two degrees of freedom. By averaging over all possible flyby geometries, we derive explicit expressions for the drift and diffusion coefficients of $x$. We then solve the resulting Fokker--Planck equation to obtain a closed-form solution for the time evolution of the particle distribution. A characteristic scattering timescale naturally emerges, scaling as $(P_{p}/M_{p}^{2})/500$, where $P_{p}$ is the planet&#x27;s orbital period and $M_{p}$ its mass ratio to the central star. The typical ejection speed of small bodies by a planet is estimated to be $3 v_p M_{p}^{1/3}$, where $v_p$ is the planet&#x27;s orbital speed. Our analytical solution constitutes a universal law applicable to both the Solar System and exoplanetary systems, providing a computationally efficient alternative to costly $N$-body simulations for studying the orbital distributions and ejection of planetesimals and planets (e.g., Kuiper Belt, Oort Cloud, debris disks, interstellar objects, and free-floating planets).</p>

The resulting expressions for the collisional rates and transport coefficients are fitted with simple analytical functions that capture their temperature dependence over a wide range of shear rates. Comparison with direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) results shows excellent quantitative agreement for the shear stress, temperature anisotropy, and steady viscosity.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.05427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Stellar and planetary magnetic fields play a crucial role in the habitability of a planet and the integrity of its atmosphere. The recently claimed detection of biosignatures, methane, carbon dioxide and dimethyl sulfide/disulfide, in the atmosphere of K2-18 b, a sub-Neptune orbiting an M dwarf star present an intriguing question regarding the stellar magnetic environment and the resistance of the planet&#x27;s magnetosphere (if it exists) to erosion by magnetic activity from the host. To probe for radio emission from the system, we have conducted observations using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at S, C and X-bands (2-4, 4.5-7.5 and 8-10 GHz respectively) to search for coherent and incoherent radio emission. We detect no radio emission associated with incoherent emission mechanisms. We report $3\sigma$ Stokes I upper limits of $49.8\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at S-band, $17.7\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$at C-band and $18.0\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at X-band and an upper limit of the ratio of the radio to the total bolometric luminosity of $\log L_\text{R}/\log L_\text{bol}&lt;-8.8$. We have also searched for short duration bursts associated with coherent emission mechanisms at C and X-bands . No signals above a $3\sigma$ significance threshold are detected. Although no signals are detected our radio observations offer constraints, albeit limited, on the stellar magnetic environment supporting recent X-ray observations indicating K2-18 is a very faint emitter. Our results also contextualise any planetary transmission spectra by providing constraints on the activity level of the host.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04105v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Conformable derivatives provide a fractional-looking calculus that remains local and admits a simple representation through classical derivatives with explicit weights. In this paper we develop a systematic operator-theoretic perspective showing that conformable time evolution is, in essence, a classical $C_0$-semigroup observed through a nonlinear clock. We introduce the conformable time map $\psi(t)=t^\alpha/\alpha$ and prove that every $C_0$--$\alpha$-semigroup $\{T_\alpha(t)\}_{t\ge0}$ can be written as $T_\alpha(t)=T(\psi(t))$ for a uniquely determined classical $C_0$-semigroup $\{T(s)\}_{s\ge0}$, with generators agreeing on a common domain. This correspondence yields a one-to-one transfer of mild solutions and shows that orbit-based linear dynamics are invariant under conformable reparametrization. In particular, $\alpha$-hypercyclicity and $\alpha$--chaos coincide with the usual notions for the associated classical semigroup. As a consequence, we obtain a conformable version of the Desch--Schappacher--Webb spectral criterion for chaos. We also place the analysis in the natural functional setting provided by conformable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p,\alpha}$ and their explicit isometric identification with standard $L^p$ spaces, which allows one to transport estimates and spectral arguments without loss. The results clarify which dynamical phenomena in conformable models are genuinely new and which are inherited from classical semigroup dynamics via a nonlinear change of time.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.06439v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We present spatially resolved ALMA observations of the water line at 183 GHz in the disk around the Herbig star HD 100546. The water vapor emission peaks at the inner edge of the warm dust cavity, located ~15 au from the central star. We attribute this to thermal desorption at the water snowline, shifted outward at the dust cavity wall directly heated by the intense radiation. This represents the first spatially resolved image of the water snowline using ALMA observations of the main water isotopologue in a protoplanetary disk. The water emission morphology peaking inside the first dust ring is consistent with previous ALMA detections of oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules in the disk, including thermally desorbed methanol. These findings signal that warm cavities of transition disks provide ideal targets to directly reconstruct the spatial distribution of water vapor and the snowline location with ALMA, and directly connect water vapor emission to ice desorption of complex organic species.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03334v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Scalable hydrogen production using proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers depends on overcoming efficiency losses arising from coupled multiphase, multicomponent transport and interfacial phenomena across the membrane electrode assembly. Here, we demonstrate a multiscale computational framework that combines pore network modeling with finite-element-based reactive transport simulations to accurately and efficiently resolve structure-performance trade-offs in porous transport layers (PTLs). We perform experiments for both commercial single-layer PTLs and microporous layer (MPL)-integrated configurations to benchmark the electrochemical model, achieving excellent agreement between modeling and measurements. We show that in single-layer PTLs, open porous networks facilitate mass transport but incur large voltage penalties from PTL-anode catalyst layer (ACL) contact resistance. Bilayer architectures with dense MPLs reduce these losses by simultaneously improving transport, contact, and structural stability. Finally, in stratified multilayer stacks, combining fine pores near the ACL with highly porous backing layers delivers superior performance at high current densities. Altogether, these results establish mechanistic guidelines for porosity-informed PTL design that minimize interfacial resistance and enable high-efficiency PEMWE operation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03887v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The microscopic and fundamental origin of slide electrification, where droplets of water move across insulating surfaces accumulating and depositing electrical charges, is still debated. Charge transfer is often attributed to ion transfer at the receding contact line. However, it is still unclear whether ion transfer alone can fully account for the observed charge separation. We examined slide electrification of two polar, self-ionizing liquids (water, formamide) and two non-polar liquids (diiodomethane, bromonaphthalene). By cooling below the melting temperature, we were able to compare this process to tribocharging of the respective frozen components. Despite having ions immobilized at sub-freezing temperatures, the ice of the polar liquids continues to accumulate significant charge. Non-polar liquids exhibit lower charging (&lt;25% of polar liquids) and nearly identical charging behaviour in both their liquid and frozen phases on five different substrates. Since non-polar liquids contain few free ions, these observations indicate an alternative charging mechanism, which could be electron transfer. Our findings suggest that slide electrification operates through two mechanisms, with the dominant charge transfer pathway shifting between ions and electron transfer depending on the electronegativity, phase, and temperature.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03935v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Gas-radiation coupling critically influences hypersonic reentry flows, where extreme temperatures induce pronounced non-equilibrium gas and radiative heat transport. Accurate and efficient simulation of radiative gas dynamics is therefore indispensable for reliable design of thermal protection systems for atmospheric entry vehicles. In this study, a Boltzmann-type kinetic model for radiative gas flows is solved across a broad spectrum of flow and radiation transport regimes using the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS). The approach integrates an unstructured finite-volume discrete velocity method with a set of macroscopic synthetic equations. Within this framework, the kinetic model provides high-order closures for the constitutive relations in the synthetic equations. Simultaneously, the macroscopic synthetic equations drive the evolution of the mesoscopic kinetic system, significantly accelerating steady-state convergence in near-continuum regimes, as substantiated by linear Fourier stability analysis. Crucially, the algorithm is proven to be asymptotic-preserving, correctly recovering the continuum and optically thick limits, represented by the radiative Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations governing distinct translational, rotational, vibrational, and radiative temperatures, on coarse meshes independent of the mean free path. Numerical simulations of challenging benchmarks, including three-dimensional hypersonic flow over an Apollo reentry capsule, demonstrate that GSIS achieves orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional iterative schemes in multiscale simulations of radiative gas flows while accurately capturing non-equilibrium effects and radiative heat transfer in hypersonic environments.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04104v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) force fields enable large-scale simulations with near-first-principles accuracy at substantially reduced computational cost. Recent work has extended ML force-field approaches to adiabatic dynamical simulations of condensed-matter lattice models with coupled electronic and structural or magnetic degrees of freedom. However, most existing formulations rely on hand-crafted, symmetry-aware descriptors, whose construction is often system-specific and can hinder generality and transferability across different lattice Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a symmetry-preserving framework based on equivariant neural networks (ENNs) that provides a general, data-driven mapping from local configurations of dynamical variables to the associated on-site forces in a lattice Hamiltonian. In contrast to ENN architectures developed for molecular systems -- where continuous Euclidean symmetries dominate -- our approach aims to embed the discrete point-group and internal symmetries intrinsic to lattice models directly into the neural-network representation of the force field. As a proof of principle, we construct an ENN-based force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of the Holstein Hamiltonian on a square lattice, a canonical system for electron-lattice physics. The resulting ML-enabled large-scale dynamical simulations faithfully capture mesoscale evolution of the symmetry-breaking phase, illustrating the utility of lattice-equivariant architectures for linking microscopic electronic processes to emergent dynamical behavior in condensed-matter lattice systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03619v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Fitness consequence of dispersal depends on property of the entire landscape, which patches are available and what are the cost of moving. These are information that are not available locally when an organism make the decision to disperse. This poses a problem to the organism, where it is unclear how an adaptive decision can be made. This also poses a problem to the scientist, since in order to study the adaptiveness of dispersal, we need information of the entire landscape. For theorist, this is through making a series of assumption about either the landscape or the organism, and for empiricists, this means a large amount of measurements needs to be made across a large area. In this paper, we propose a link between local demographic process, which an organism can have access to, to the fitness consequence of dispersal. This meant local environmental cue can be used for the decision on dispersal, and hence allow the evolution of plastic dispersal strategy. We will then show that using this approach, evolution of dispersal on complex landscape can be modelled with relative ease, and to show that accidental dispersal in one patch can drive the evolution of adaptive dispersal in another.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03656v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Long-range interactions and electric response are essential for accurate modeling of condensed-phase systems, but capturing them efficiently remains a challenge for atomistic machine learning. Traditionally, these two phenomena can be represented by static charges, that participate in Coulomb interactions between atoms, and dynamic charges such as atomic polar tensors - aka Born effective charges - describing the response to an external electric field. We critically compare different approaches to learn both types of charges, taking bulk water and water clusters as paradigmatic examples: (1) Learning them independently; (2) Coupling static and dynamic charges based on their physical relationship with a single global coupling constant to account for dielectric screening; (3) Coupled learning with a local, environment-dependent screening factor. In the coupled case, correcting for dielectric screening is essential, yet the common assumption of homogeneous, isotropic screening breaks down in heterogeneous systems such as water clusters. A learned, environment-dependent screening restores high accuracy for the dynamical charges. However, the accuracy gain over independent dynamic predictions is negligible, while the computational cost increases compared to using separate models for static and dynamical charges. This suggests that, despite the formal connection between the two charge types, modeling them independently is the more practical choice for both condensed-phase and isolated cluster systems.</p>

When the state variables of the plant represent the concentrations of chemical substances and the control action constitutes an instantaneous introduction of a certain quantity of a chemical or drug, this control setup is referred to as a (discrete) dosing problem. The present paper examines an amplitude- and frequency-modulated impulsive controller that, under stationary conditions, generates a desired sequence of uniform and equidistant control impulses based on continuous measurements of the output of a smooth positive nonlinear time-invariant single-input single-output plant with Wiener structure. The controller design method is based on constructing and stabilizing the fixed point of a discrete map that describes the evolution of the state vector of the continuous plant between successive impulsive control action instants. Stability of the fixed point ensures the existence of a basin of attraction along the stationary trajectory, where the solution of a perturbed closed-loop system converges to the stationary solution. The convergence rate is determined by the slopes of the amplitude and frequency modulation functions of the impulsive controller. The proposed controller is applied to the dosing of the drug \emph{atracurium} in closed-loop neuromuscular blockade, and its performance is evaluated on a database of patient-specific pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models estimated from clinical data. It is demonstrated that an implementation of the standard regimen as a pulse-modulated feedback controller significantly minimizes the incidence of underdosing events.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2308.08794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Tipping points are abrupt, drastic, and often irreversible changes in the evolution of non-stationary and chaotic dynamical systems. For instance, increased greenhouse gas concentrations are predicted to lead to drastic decreases in low cloud cover, referred to as a climatological tipping point. In this paper, we learn the evolution of such non-stationary dynamical systems using a novel recurrent neural operator (RNO), which learns mappings between function spaces. After training RNO on only the pre-tipping dynamics, we employ it to detect future tipping points using an uncertainty-based approach. In particular, we propose a conformal prediction framework to forecast tipping points by monitoring deviations from physics constraints (such as conserved quantities and partial differential equations), enabling forecasting of these abrupt changes along with a rigorous measure of uncertainty. We illustrate our proposed methodology on non-stationary ordinary and partial differential equations, such as the Lorenz-63 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations. We also apply our methods to forecast a climate tipping point in stratocumulus cloud cover and airfoil wake and stall transitions using only limited knowledge of the governing equations. For the latter, we show that our proposed method zero-shot generalizes to forecasting multiple future tipping points under varying Reynolds numbers. In our experiments, we demonstrate that even partial or approximate physics constraints can be used to accurately forecast future tipping points.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03930v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Phage display is a powerful laboratory technique used to study the interactions between proteins and other molecules, whether other proteins, peptides, DNA or RNA. The under-utilisation of this data in conjunction with deep learning models for protein design may be attributed to; high experimental noise levels; the complex nature of data pre-processing; and difficulty interpreting these experimental results. In this work, we propose a novel approach utilising a Bayesian Neural Network within a training loop, in order to simulate the phage display experiment and its associated noise. Our goal is to investigate how understanding the experimental noise and model uncertainty can enable the reliable application of such models to reliably interpret phage display experiments. We validate our approach using actual binding affinity measurements instead of relying solely on proxy values derived from &#x27;held-out&#x27; phage display rounds.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Experimental evolution in a host–parasite microcosm shows that selection at epidemic wave fronts can favor higher infectivity with reduced virulence to enhance spread, illustrating eco-evolutionary feedbacks relevant to general evolutionary dynamics rather than core origins-of-life processes.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spreading epidemics can foster the rapid emergence of novel parasite variants. Similar to range expansions, parasites at the front of an epidemic wave may evolve traits facilitating their spatial spread. Typically, higher transmissibility and virulence are expected to evolve at the epidemic front, but predictions change if virulence reduces dispersal of infected hosts. We investigated the feedbacks between epidemiology and evolution in interconnected microcosms of the ciliate Paramecium caudatum and its bacterial parasite Holospora undulata. First, two long-term treatments mimicked the moving front of epidemic waves, with and without the natural dispersal of infected hosts. Phenotypic trait assays revealed an eco-to-evo feedback: wave-front parasites (i.e., travelling with infected hosts) were less virulent and interfered less with host dispersal, but also showed higher infectivity, compared to parasites from the control treatment. Whole-genome resequencing corroborated phenotypic divergence, but the genetic targets of selection remain unknown. Second, measurement of the spread of evolved parasites in linear landscapes demonstrated an evo-to-eco feedback: wave-front parasites produced stronger infection outbreaks and faster spreading epidemic waves than did evolution-control parasites. A simulation model assessed the relative importance of the different parasite traits in determining infectious spread over a broad parameter range. It suggests that, if dispersal is generally low, higher infectivity alone can produce the observed differences in epidemic spread speed. Our study illustrates how the need to travel with the host shapes eco-evolutionary feedbacks at parasite invasion fronts, and it highlights the importance of considering concomitant evolutionary change when predicting epidemic speed.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Antifolate resistance in P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase remains a major challenge for malaria control. To understand how this enzyme preserves function under antifolate selection, we developed PfPATH, a computational framework that integrates mutational fitness measurements, evolutionary interactions, and structural information to map plausible adaptive trajectories. PfPATH adaptive walks reveal that only a small subset of residues forms a constrained adaptive ridge that guides evolution. Most resistance mutations are harmful on their own and only become viable when supported by stabilizing changes. Hence, adaptation is confined to a few constrained pathways yielding high resistance. Structural network analyses indicate that these resistance mutations do not disrupt the overall enzyme architecture. Instead, they reorganize internal communication in a way that preserves catalytic function. We further showed through molecular dynamics and free-energy analyses that resistant variants remain structurally stable while exploring broader low-energy conformational substates. In conclusion, our work reveals a narrow and predictable route to antifolate escape, with implications for anticipating resistance evolution and guiding future drug design.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> A perspective piece arguing that long-term human–Mycobacterium tuberculosis co-evolution produces multiple immunological pathways to disease, and that systems-biology tools (e.g., single-cell/spatial transcriptomics) must model this complexity rather than seek a single mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tuberculosis is once again the most fatal global infectious disease and has killed many more humans than any other pathogen. Despite the identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) over 140 years ago, we have yet to control the epidemic. A central issue is the complexity of the host–pathogen interaction, with multiple underlying pathways leading to tuberculosis disease. This intricate relationship stems from the prolonged co-evolution of the pathogen with humans, resulting in diverse immunological processes leading to tuberculosis disease. Conversely, Mtb exposure may give a survival advantage through innate immune training, thereby providing selective pressure over millennia. Emerging methodologies, such as single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, offer a golden opportunity to understand the immunology unpinning this host–pathogen interaction at unprecedented resolution. However, these analyses will be fundamentally flawed if they do not consider the intricacies of human Mtb infection. Here, we propose that attempts to find single immunological mechanisms leading to tuberculosis are hindering progress, and we must embrace the complexity of multiple paths to disease to allow the systems biology era to deliver transformative solutions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces and benchmarks a machine-learning perturbation model (RAZOR) for charged Pt(111)–water interfaces, focusing on avoiding dielectric breakdown artifacts to accurately reproduce ab initio interfacial water structure and potential response under modest bias.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The recently introduced &quot;Response analysis in z-orientation&quot; (RAZOR) model utilizes perturbation theory to machine learn the energy and force response to applied bias charges in atomistic simulations of electrified interfaces. While we have shown that RAZOR successfully reproduces ab initio results for adsorbates on metallic surfaces in an implicit solvent environment, real electrochemical applications require the inclusion of at least a few explicit H2O layers of the electrolyte. Here, we benchmark RAZOR&#x27;s performance in the description of the Pt(111)-H2O interface. We show that RAZOR can reliably reproduce ab initio molecular dynamics findings for bias-induced changes in H2O density and orientation profiles as well as changes in the potential. To do so, a specific training procedure needs to be applied which avoids the erroneous learning of artifacts from the dielectric breakdown of interfacial water and the accompanying charge transfer into the H2O layers. Ultimately, we are confident that RAZOR can provide quantitative predictions in a +/- 20 muC/cm2 window around the neutral-charged cell, which is sufficient for many pressing electrochemical questions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In-situ soft X-ray spectroscopy provides direct insight into the electronic structure of electrocatalysts under realistic reaction conditions but remains technically challenging due to the need to combine aqueous electrochemistry with ultra-high-vacuum detection. Here we present a mesoporous carbon–membrane working electrode assembly (WEA) that enables window-free in-situ XPS and NEXAFS measurements during electrochemical reactions. The design integrates a Nafion™ proton-exchange membrane with a mesoporous carbon–ionomer contact layer and a thin IrOₓ catalyst layer, providing continuous electronic and protonic pathways and stable hydration through the membrane. By tuning the chamber water vapor pressure to 8 mbar, the WEA maintains a nanometer-thin water layer sufficient for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) while preserving photoelectron detection efficiency. A robust peristaltic pumping system and closed-loop alumina-bed water vapor dosing maintain steady-state hydration at 6–10 mbar with &lt;±0.1 mbar variation, enabling reproducible in-siut spectra over extended periods. In-situ Ir 4f and O 1s XPS reveal reversible oxidation of Ir³⁺/Ir⁴⁺ to Ir⁴⁺/Ir⁵⁺ and dynamic changes in hydroxyl and lattice oxygen species, while O K-edge NEXAFS identify the formation of μ₂–O and μ₁–O species at OER potential, corresponding to OER-active intermediates. The WEA thus provides a quantitative, window-free platform for probing electrochemical interfaces under near-ambient conditions and establishes a general methodology for in-situ soft X-ray studies of functional electrocatalysts, closely resembling the architecture and operation of industrial membrane-based water electrolysers. This approach establishes a reliable methodology for coupling electrochemistry with the element specific soft X-ray spectroscopy under realistic reaction conditions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> LORA is a Snakemake-based, reproducible long-read genome assembly pipeline integrating multiple assemblers and QC/reporting steps for bacterial and unicellular eukaryote datasets, offering general genomics utility but minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Genome assembly from long-read sequencing data has become a standard approach for resolving complex genomic regions and producing high-contiguity assemblies. However, the diversity of available assemblers, their varying performance across species, and the need for reproducible workflows present ongoing challenges. We developed LORA, an easy-to-use and reproducible application for assembling genomes from long-read data. LORA integrates several well-established assemblers, including Canu, HiFiasm, Flye, and Unicycler, as well as more recent tools such as Necat and Pecat. It is implemented as a Snakemake pipeline to parallelize tasks and support seamless execution on both local machines and computing clusters. LORA includes multiple quality assessment steps, interactive HTML reports for interpretation, BLAST-based taxonomic identification, and completeness evaluation. Together, these features provide users with a comprehensive view of assembly quality and potential problematic. We illustrate the capabilities of LORA using datasets from bacterial genomes and unicellular eukaryotes, sequenced with both PacBio and Oxford Nanopore technologies, highlighting typical outcomes and common pitfalls encountered during long-read assemblies. LORA is distributed as part of the Sequana project, an open-source framework designed for reproducibility, maintainability, and straightforward deployment across computing environments.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Operando X-ray diffraction reveals how oxygen-loss-driven surface reconstruction in Ni-rich layered oxide cathodes promotes heterogeneous bulk delithiation and accelerates capacity fade during high-voltage cycling.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The electrochemical performance of single-crystalline Ni-rich layered oxide cathodes is fundamentally limited by bulk Li⁺ diffusion within micrometre-sized particles. During high-voltage cycling—necessary for high-energy applications—intraparticle Li⁺ diffusion is further impeded by oxygen-loss-induced surface reconstruction from the layered phase to spinel/rock-salt structures. Therefore, to fully understand how bulk Li⁺ transport kinetics influences electrochemical degradation, it is necessary to establish the correlation between surface reconstruction and bulk delithiation during the anisotropic structural evolution (i.e., expansion of the layers followed by their contraction) of the cathode particles during long-term cycling. In this work, we accomplish this using multi-rate operando X-ray diffraction studies of single-crystalline Ni-rich layered oxide cathodes aged under different voltage windows in single-layer pouch full cells. We quantify how increased surface reconstruction leads to greater heterogeneity in bulk delithiation, thereby promoting phase separation and exacerbating electrochemical capacity fade. These results provide a direct mechanistic link between surface degradation and bulk delithiation in such cathodes and offer a framework for non-destructively probing kinetics-dependent degradation under practically relevant conditions to guide strategies for improved cycling stability.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Reports an MSI2–HOXA9 fusion as an oncogenic second hit in blast-crisis CML that increases mitochondrial gene expression and respiration, with limited direct relevance to origins-of-life questions beyond general RNA/mitochondrial biology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Myeloid leukemias, diseases marked by aggressiveness and poor outcomes, are frequently triggered by oncogenic translocations. In the case of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), the BCR-ABL fusion initiates chronic phase disease with second hits allowing progression to blast crisis. Although Gleevec has been transformative for CML, blast crisis CML remains relatively drug resistant. Here, we show that MSI2-HOXA9 , a translocation with an unknown role in cancer, can serve as a second hit in driving bcCML. Compared to BCR-ABL, BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 led to a more aggressive disease in vivo with decreased latency, increased lethality, and a differentiation blockade that is a hallmark of blast crisis. Domain mapping revealed that the MSI2 RNA binding domain RRM1 had a preferential impact on growth and lethality of bcCML relative to RRM2 or the HOXA9 domain. Mechanistically, MSI2-HOXA9 triggered global downstream changes with a preferential upregulation of mitochondrial components. Consistent with this, BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 cells exhibited a significant increase in mitochondrial respiration. These data suggest that MSI2-HOXA9 acts, at least in part, by increasing expression of the mitochondrial polymerase POLRMT and augmenting mitochondrial function and basal respiration in blast crisis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate for the first time that translocations involving the stem and developmental signal MSI2 can be oncogenic and suggest that MSI, which we found to be a frequent partner for an array of translocations, could also be a driver mutation across solid cancers.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Using single-cell and bulk transcriptomics, the study links intrinsic replication stress in luminal progenitors to ELF3 upregulation that mitigates genomic instability while promoting transformation in BRCA1-deficient breast tumorigenesis.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> BRCA1 is a critical tumor suppressor, mutations in which greatly increase risks for many tumors in carriers, most notably breast cancer. Luminal progenitor cells (LPs) are the currently recognized cells of origin of BRCA1-deficient breast cancers. However, the reason why LPs are prone to transform with BRCA1 deficiency has not been elucidated. Here, using single-cell sequencing of human BRCA1 mutant breast cancers and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of BRCA1 -deficient normal mammary cells, we reveal that replication stress is a feature of LPs and a driving factor during BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, replication stress and BRCA1 deficiency lead to significant upregulation of ELF3 expression. ELF3 can help suppress excessive genomic instability and promote LP transformation with BRCA1 deficiency. Moreover, ELF3 emerged as a core transcription factor regulating LP genes, leading to LP expansion. Our findings suggest that replication stress is a driving factor during BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis in luminal progenitor cells and elucidates the key role of ELF3 during this process.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Materials-chemistry preprint showing highly efficient chirality transfer from Δ/Λ metal complexes into nematic liquid crystals, offering a potential model system for studying chiral amplification and ordered-phase effects relevant (indirectly) to prebiotic homochirality.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nematic (N) liquid crystals (LCs), characterized by one-dimensional orientational order, readily transform into chiral nematic (N*) phases upon the incorporation of optically active substances, known as chiral dopants. While the ease of N* induction has driven the extensive development of organic chiral dopants, coordination compounds possessing Δ/Λ chirality have emerged as compelling alternatives, offering distinct structural and functional attributes. A defining feature of these &quot;metallodopants&quot; is their exceptionally high helical twisting power (HTP). For instance, early studies demonstrated that the simple complex Λ-[Ru(acac)3] exhibits a remarkably high HTP of 90 micrometer-1 in MBBA (N-(4-methoxybenzylidene)-4-butylaniline). This efficiency is attributed to the rigid coordination framework, which facilitates robust chirality transfer to the host LC. However, metallodopants often face challenges regarding miscibility with nematic hosts and intrinsic coloration, potentially complicating their integration into optical devices; consequently, systematic investigations have been limited compared to organic dopants. Nevertheless, metallodopants offer unique advantages. In tris(chelate) metal complexes, the sense of the induced helix (P or M) is strongly correlated with ligand orientation; for example, a 90° rotation of a ligand’s elongation axis can reverse the helical sense. This predictable inversion, supported by theoretical models, underscores the critical role of structural rigidity. Furthermore, the intrinsic absorption of these complexes, once viewed as a drawback, is now being harnessed for resonance Raman enhancement and chiroptical modulation. By combining high HTPs, predictable helix inversion, and spectroscopic utility, coordination compounds are positioning themselves as versatile competitors to organic dopants, serving as both functional inducers and optical probes for next-generation photonic and sensing technologies.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a DMS-MaPseq-based framework to quantify RNA hairpin structure and in-cell protein occupancy at single-nucleotide resolution, enabling effective affinity/occupancy estimates that predict functional outcomes (RNA decay) in human cells.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> RNA structures that form inside living cells influence processes ranging from translation to RNA decay, many of which are controlled by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Because RBP specificity depends on both local RNA structure and sequence motifs, traditional pulldown-based methods often obscure the structural context of bound RNAs. Here, a quantitative framework based on dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling and sequencing (DMS-MaPseq) is introduced that jointly measures RNA structure and protein binding at single-nucleotide resolution in human cells, enabling estimation of effective RNA-protein affinities and fractional occupancy directly in cells. Application of this approach to a 1,600-member library of MS2 hairpin mutants reveals that RNA folding is the strongest determinant of MS2 coat protein (MCP) recognition, and that stable MS2 structures must form for MCP to bind its target sequence. MCP also shows strong preference for its consensus loop sequence while displaying minimal dependence on stem length beyond ten base pairs or on stem GC content. Incorporation of an inducible degron fused to MCP allows precise tuning of intracellular protein concentrations analogous to those of many endogenous RBPs and show that DMS reactivity changes can be used to infer binding specificities across a subsaturating regime. A quantitative occupancy framework further shows that inferred fraction-bound values accurately predict how efficiently MCP fused to a downregulatory-domain drives RNA degradation. Together, these results establish a generalizable approach for measuring RBP-RNA affinities with structural resolution in living cells, dissecting how sequence and structure contribute to RBP recognition, and quantitatively linking occupancy to functional output.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study shows that piRNA/PIWI signaling in the ciliate Oxytricha guides N6-adenine DNA methylation (6mA) via MTA1 to mark and protect genomic regions from programmed deletion during nuclear development, illustrating an RNA-directed epigenetic mechanism for genome maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The ciliate Oxytricha undergoes massive genome rearrangements during development to produce a functional nucleus from an encrypted zygotic genome. PIWI-interacting small RNAs protect DNA regions against deletion, but how that protective mark is established has been a mystery. Recently our lab discovered MTA1, a methyltransferase that catalyzes DNA N6-adenine (6mA) methylation. Both MTA1 and the Oxytricha Piwi protein, Otiwi1, are required for development, and Otiwi1 mutation eliminates 6mA signal. To examine the role of 6mA, we analyzed its genome-wide distribution across development in wild-type and MTA1 mutant backcrossed cells. We find specific and abundant enrichment on retained sequences, suggesting a protective role for this epigenetic mark. Furthermore, programmed retention of a DNA region that is normally deleted leads to accumulation of new 6mA marks on the ectopically retained DNA sequence. Together, these results suggest that piRNA-guided 6mA DNA methylation leads to protection of DNA sequences against deletion during nuclear differentiation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> To evaluate the impact of wildfire on drinking water treatability, wildfire ash is often added to source water to reflect post-fire source water quality change. The use of varying experimental conditions has led to conflicting inferences across studies and inconsistent results, even between nominal replicates. Here, mixing time and ash concentration effects on wildfire ash-impacted water (WAIW) quality were investigated, and their impacts on leached water extractable organic matter (WEOM) from wildfire and prescribed fire ash were characterized at bench-scale. The effects of mixing time and ash-to-water ratios were investigated using both natural river water and ultrapure water. Notably, WEOM concentration and character varied considerably within the first 24 hours of mixing, and water type and ash mass concentration limit the leaching of WEOM into water. These results highlight the critical role of careful experimental design and well-justified approaches to support meaningful interpretation and comparability across studies.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Materials/electrocatalysis study demonstrating size-controlled hydrothermal synthesis of high-entropy spinel oxide nanoparticles that boost oxygen-evolution (water-splitting) performance, with only indirect relevance to Origins of Life via general redox/energy catalysis contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> High-entropy oxides offer a promising platform for oxygen evolution reaction catalysis owing to their entropy-stabilized structures and flexible design of cation metal elements. However, conventional high-temperature synthesis leads to extensive particle growth and limits access to nanoscale particles with higher density of catalytic sites. Here, a subcritical hydrothermal synthesis combined with catechol-assisted growth regulation is introduced to produce high-entropy single-phase spinel oxide nanoparticles with controlled crystallite sizes down to the single-nanometer scale. The resulting reduction in particle size markedly enhances the oxygen evolution activity. A linear dependence of the oxygen evolution current density on the inverse crystallite size highlights the critical role of nanoscale structures in accelerating catalytic reactions. In-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals electronic and structural robustness of all constituent metal elements under OER conditions, with negligible shifts in oxidation state or changes in local coordination structure, which is distinct from the pronounced reconstruction typically observed in conventional oxide catalysts. When deployed in a membrane electrode assembly, our synthesized high-entropy oxide catalysts with the smallest particle size deliver 2.0 A cm-2 at 1.96 V, demonstrating practical relevance for high-current-density electrolysis. This work establishes low-temperature hydrothermal synthesis with organic molecular regulation as a powerful and scalable route to engineer highly crystalline, compositionally homogeneous high-entropy oxide nanoparticles, offering design guidelines for next-generation oxygen evolution reaction catalysts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> To evaluate the impact of wildfire on drinking water treatability, wildfire ash is often added to source water to reflect post-fire source water quality change. The use of varying experimental conditions has led to conflicting inferences across studies and inconsistent results, even between nominal replicates. Here, mixing time and ash concentration effects on wildfire ash-impacted water (WAIW) quality were investigated, and their impacts on leached water extractable organic matter (WEOM) from wildfire and prescribed fire ash were characterized at bench-scale. The effects of mixing time and ash-to-water ratios were investigated using both natural river water and ultrapure water. Notably, WEOM concentration and character varied considerably within the first 24 hours of mixing, and water type and ash mass concentration limit the leaching of WEOM into water. These results highlight the critical role of careful experimental design and well-justified approaches to support meaningful interpretation and comparability across studies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2510.20046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Solvable bosonic models provide a fundamental framework for describing light propagation in nonlinear media, including optical down-conversion processes that generate squeezed states of light and their higher-order generalizations. In quantum optics a central objective is to determine the time evolution of a given initial state. Exact analytic solution to the state-evolution problem is presented, applicable to a broad class of solvable bosonic models and arbitrary initial states. Moreover, the characteristic equation governing the energy spectrum is derived and the eigenstates are found in the form of continued fractions and as the principal minors of the associated Jacobi matrix. The results provide a solid analytical framework for discussion of exactly solvable bosonic models.</p>

In a recent article, the first two authors of the present paper introduced partially cosymplectic structures as a geometric framework for thermodynamic systems, recovering the evolution equations obtained variationally.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02621v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Stellar photospheric heterogeneities (e.g., starspots, faculae) distort the stellar spectrum in transit and imprint wavelength-dependent biases on the planet-to-star radius ratio (Transit Light Source Effect, TLSE). The Rackham-TLSE (R-TLSE) prescription applies a disc-averaged correction based solely on filling factor and spectral contrast, but transmission spectroscopy also depends on limb darkening, active-region distribution, and transit geometry. We include these in a pixel-resolved framework, ECLIPSE-Xlambda, and run idealised noise-free model-model comparisons to R-TLSE. For LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, and WASP-69 b, disc-averaged corrections differ from the pixel model by up to about 400 ppm in the optical for active hosts and non-equatorial transits, but stay below about 10 ppm in the near-infrared where limb darkening is weak. We then apply both approaches to the JWST/NIRISS SOSS spectrum of LHS 1140 b. With limb darkening set to zero, ECLIPSE-Xlambda recovers stellar-contamination parameters matching the reference R-TLSE solution, confirming consistency in the disc-averaged limit. With wavelength-dependent limb darkening, reproducing the short-wavelength slope via stellar contamination alone requires hot faculae (delta Tfac about 600 K; ffac about 0.35), equivalent to a circular facular region of radius about 0.6 Rstar (about 60% of the stellar radius) on the disc; such an extended unocculted region is physically unlikely even for an active M dwarf. Purely stellar contamination would therefore require extreme faculae, whereas a genuine atmospheric contribution complementing a more modest facular signal is more plausible. These results delineate the validity regime of R-TLSE and underscore the need for geometry-aware stellar-heterogeneity models including limb darkening in high-precision transmission spectroscopy.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02548v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The rise of oxygen in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere during the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) occurred about 2.3 billion years ago. There is considerably greater uncertainty for the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis, but it likely occurred significantly earlier, perhaps by 700 million years. Assuming this time lag is proportional to the rate of oxygen generation, we can estimate how long it would take for a GOE-like event to occur on a hypothetical Earth-analog planet orbiting the star TRAPPIST-1 (a late M star with Teff 2560 K). Although in the habitable zone, an Earth-analog planet located in TRAPPIST-1e&#x27;s orbit would receive only 0.9% of the Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) that the Earth gets from the Sun. This is because most of the star&#x27;s light is emitted at wavelengths longer than the 400-700 nm PAR range. Thus it would take 63 Gyrs for a GOE to occur. But the linear assumption is problematic; as light levels increase, photosynthesis saturates then declines, an effect known as photoinhibition. Photoinhibition varies from species to species and depends on a host of environmental factors. There is also sensitivity to the upper wavelength limit of the PAR: extending just 50 nm increases the number of photons by a factor of 2.5. Including these and other factors greatly reduces the timescale to roughly 1-5 Gyrs for a GOE. However, non-oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria can thrive in low-light environments and can use near-IR light out to 1100 nm, providing 22 times as many photons. With this huge light advantage, and because they evolved earlier, anoxygenic photosynthesizers would likely dominate the ecosystem. On a late M-star Earth-analog planet, oxygen may never reach significant levels in the atmosphere and a GOE may never occur, let alone a Cambrian Explosion. Thus complex animal life is unlikely.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02545v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Pebble drift is an important mechanism for supplying the materials needed to build planets in the inner region of protoplanetary disks. Thus, constraining pebble drift&#x27;s timescales and mass flux is essential to understanding planet formation history. Current pebble drift models suggest pebble fluxes can be constrained from the enhancement of gaseous volatile abundances when icy pebbles sublimate after drifting across key snowlines. In this work, we present ALMA observations of spatially resolved $^{13}$C$^{18}$O J=2-1 line emission inside the midplane CO snowline of the HD 163296 and MWC 480 protoplanetary disks. We use radiative transfer and thermochemical models to constrain the spatial distribution of CO gas column density. We find that both disks display centrally peaked CO abundance enhancement of up to ten times of ISM abundance levels. For HD 163296 and MWC 480, the inferred enhancements require 250-350 and 480-660 Earth Masses of pebbles to have drifted across their CO snowlines, respectively. These ranges fall within cumulative pebble mass flux ranges to grow gas giants in the interior to the CO snowline. The centrally peaked CO enhancement is unexpected in current pebble drift models, which predict CO enhancement peaks at the CO snowline or is uniform inside the snowline. We propose two hypotheses to explain the centrally-peaked CO enhancement, including a large CO desorption distance and CO trapped in water ice. By testing both hypotheses with the 1D gas and dust evolution code chemcomp, we find that volatile trapping (about 30\%) best reproduces the centrally peaked CO enhancement observed.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02556v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The Lazuli Space Observatory is a 3-meter aperture astronomical facility designed for rapid-response observations and precision astrophysics across visible to near-infrared wavelengths (400-1700 nm bandpass). An off-axis, freeform telescope delivers diffraction-limited image quality (Strehl $&gt;$0.8 at 633 nm) to three instruments across a wide, flat focal plane. The three instruments provide complementary capabilities: a Wide-field Context Camera (WCC) delivers multi-band imaging over a 35&#x27; $\times$ 12&#x27; footprint with high-cadence photometry; an Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) provides continuous 400-1700 nm spectroscopy at R $\sim$ 100-500 for stable spectrophotometry; and an ExtraSolar Coronagraph (ESC) enables high-contrast imaging expected to reach raw contrasts of $10^{-8}$ and post-processed contrasts approaching $10^{-9}$. Operating from a 3:1 lunar-resonant orbit, Lazuli will respond to targets of opportunity in under four hours--a programmatic requirement designed to enable routine temporal responsiveness that is unprecedented for a space telescope of this size. Lazuli&#x27;s technical capabilities are shaped around three broad science areas: (1) time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, (2) stars and planets, and (3) cosmology. These capabilities enable a potent mix of science spanning gravitational wave counterpart characterization, fast-evolving transients, Type Ia supernova cosmology, high-contrast exoplanet imaging, and spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres. While these areas guide the observatory design, Lazuli is conceived as a general-purpose facility capable of supporting a wide range of astrophysical investigations, with open time for the global community. We describe the observatory architecture and capabilities in the preliminary design phase, with science operations anticipated following a rapid development cycle from concept to launch.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02665v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We report the discovery of a sub-Neptune and a Neptune-like planet ($R_b = 2.48^{+0.14}_{-0.10}\,R_\oplus$, $R_c = 4.03^{+0.23}_{-0.15}\,R_\oplus$) orbiting the F-type star TOI-4495. The planets have orbital periods of 2.567 days and 5.185 days, lying close to a 2:1 mean-motion resonance (MMR). Our photodynamical analysis of the TESS light curves constrains the planetary masses to $M_b = 7.7 \pm 1.4\,M_\oplus$ and $M_c = 23.2 \pm 4.7\,M_\oplus$. The measured masses and radii indicate the presence of volatile-rich gaseous envelopes on both planets. The Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and the Doppler shadow of TOI-4495 c reveal a well-aligned orbit with a projected stellar obliquity of $\lambda = -2.3^{+8.3}_{-7.8}\,\mathrm{deg}$. Combined with the low mutual inclination constrained by the photodynamical analysis ($\Delta I &lt; 8.7\,\mathrm{deg}$), the planetary orbits are likely coplanar and aligned with the host star&#x27;s spin axis. We show that the planets are near, but not in, the 2:1 MMR, with a circulating resonant angle. We also find substantial free eccentricity for the inner planet, TOI-4495 b ($e_b = 0.078^{+0.020}_{-0.013}$). Given the observed proximity to the 2:1 resonance and the more massive outer planet, TOI-4495 b and c are particularly susceptible to resonant overstability, which can convert resonantly excited eccentricity into free eccentricity. However, additional mechanisms (e.g., planetesimal scattering) may be required to further excite the eccentricity by $\sim 4\%$. To prevent tidal damping from reducing the eccentricity below the observed level over the star&#x27;s lifetime (1.9 Gyr), the reduced tidal quality factor of TOI-4495 b must be $Q&#x27; \gtrsim 10^5$, consistent with the presence of a thick envelope on the planet.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02479v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Planet formation is inherently linked to protoplanetary disc evolution, which recent developments suggest is driven by magnetised winds rather than turbulent viscosity. We study planet formation in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind-driven discs, assuming accretion occurs in a laminar surface layer above a weakly turbulent midplane. Our goal is to assess the global consequences of recent hydrodynamical results, including inefficient midplane heating and the existence of two Type II migration regimes: slow viscosity-dominated and fast wind-driven migration. We perform single-embryo planetary population syntheses with varying initial disc conditions (i.e. disc mass, size and angular momentum transport), and embryo starting locations, testing different prescriptions for the accretion layer thickness $\Sigma_\text{active}$. Thin ($\lesssim0.01\mathrm{g\,cm^{-2}}$) or fast ($\gtrsim12\%$ sonic velocity) accretion layers result in slow, viscosity-dominated regime which strongly limits the extent of Type II migration. For thick ($\gtrsim1\mathrm{g\,cm^{-2}}$) or slow ($\lesssim3\%$ sonic velocity) accretion layers, fast wind-driven Type II migration occurs frequently, leading to long-range inward migration that sets in once planets reach masses sufficient to block the accreting layer. Disk-limited gas accretion is also strongly affected by deep and early gap opening, limiting maximum giant planet masses. These effects strongly influence the final mass-distance distribution. For thin layers, giant planets form nearly in situ once they have entered Type II migration, which happens already at a few Earth masses, while thick layers lead to numerous migrated Hot Jupiters. Overall, we find that while the global properties of the emerging planet population are strongly modified relative to classical viscous discs, key properties of the observed population can be reproduced within this new paradigm.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02593v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Isotopic abundance ratios in protoplanetary disks are critical for understanding volatile inheritance and chemical evolution in planet-forming environments. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the rare isotopologue 13C18O(2-1) at approximately 0.3 arcsec resolution from the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296, combined with archival observations of C17O(2-1), C18O(1-0), and C17O(1-0), to empirically constrain carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios without detailed disk modeling. Both the C17O/13C18O(2-1) and C18O/C17O(1-0) flux ratios rise sharply across the CO snowline and flatten beyond 1.5 arcsec (r &gt;= 150 au), where the emission becomes optically thin. This transition, reflecting a steep drop in CO column density set by the disk&#x27;s thermal structure, makes HD 163296 an optimal case for isotopic analysis. Using beam-averaged intensities of the four transitions measured in this optically thin region, we derive isotopic ratios of 12C/13C = 75.3 (+14.7/-11.4) and 18O/17O = 3.28 (+0.31/-0.26), both consistent with local interstellar medium values. The 16O/18O ratio remains weakly constrained due to moderate optical depth in the C18O(1-0) line and degeneracy with CO column density. These results demonstrate that rare CO isotopologues can provide robust, empirical constraints on isotopic ratios in disks when sharp structural transitions allow for the identification of optically thin regions, and establish HD 163296 as a benchmark for extending such studies to other systems with resolved snowline structures.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2505.08863v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Debris disks are exoplanetary systems that contain planets, minor bodies (i.e., asteroids, Kuiper belt objects, comets, etc.), and micron-sized debris dust. Since water ice is the most common frozen volatile, it plays an essential role in the formation of planets and minor bodies. Although water ice has been commonly found in Kuiper belt objects and comets in the Solar System, no definitive evidence for water ice in debris disks has been obtained to date. Here, we report the discovery of water ice in the HD 181327 disk using the James Webb Space Telescope Near-Infrared Spectrograph. We detect the solid-state broad absorption feature of water ice at 3 $\mu$m and a distinct Fresnel peak feature at 3.1 $\mu$m, a characteristic of large water-ice particles. This implies the presence of a water-ice reservoir in the HD 181327 exoKuiper belt. Gradients of water-ice features at different stellocentric distances reveal a dynamic process of destroying and replenishing water ice in the disk, with estimated water-ice mass fractions ranging from 0.1% at ~85 au to 14% at ~113 au. It is highly plausible that the icy bodies that release water ice in HD 181327 could be the extra-solar counterparts of some of the Kuiper belt objects in our Solar System, supported by their spectral similarity.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Modeling how dust traps and disc turbulence control pebble retention and volatile delivery in protoplanetary discs, yielding observational predictions (mm continuum morphologies) that constrain planet-forming environments relevant to prebiotic material transport.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02486v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This manuscript investigates the impact of key dust evolution parameters on dust retention and trapping in protoplanetary discs. Using models with and without pressure bumps, combined with radiative transfer simulations, images of the dust continuum emission at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths, their fluxes and observed disc sizes are presented. For discs without pressure bumps (smooth discs), significant dust mass can only be retained over Myr timescales when dust fragmentation velocities are low (1m/s) and with viscosity values of $\alpha=10^{-3}$. For such a combination of fragmentation velocity and viscosity, the synthetic images show a bright inner emission follow by a shallow emission with potential gaps if they are present in the gas profile as well. At higher fragmentation velocities (5-10m/s), most dust is lost due to radial drift at million-year timescales unless pressure traps are present, in which case dust masses can increase by orders of magnitude and structures are observed in synthetic images. The viscosity parameter strongly shapes observable features, with low $\alpha$ producing sharper, potentially asymmetric inner wall cavities in inclined discs due to optically thick emission. High $\alpha$ favors the appearance of shoulders around the predominant rings that dust trapping produces. However, distinguishing between different fragmentation velocities observationally remains challenging. The inferred dust disc sizes from synthetic observations do not always correspond directly to dust model sizes or to the location of pressure bumps. Finally, we discuss implications for pebble fluxes and the delivery of volatiles to the inner disc. These results emphasize the strong degeneracies among dust evolution parameters and highlight the need for multi-wavelength, high-resolution observations to disentangle the processes shaping the formation of planets in protoplanetary discs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02407v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Standard simulations of the Iterated Prisoners Dilemma (IPD) operate in deterministic, noise-free environments, producing strategies that may be theoretically optimal but fragile when confronted with real-world uncertainty. This paper addresses two critical gaps in evolutionary game theory research: (1) the absence of realistic environmental stressors during strategy evolution, and (2) the Interpretability Gap, where evolved genetic strategies remain opaque binary sequences devoid of semantic meaning. We introduce a novel framework combining stochastic environmental perturbations (God Mode) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based behavioral profiling to transform evolved genotypes into interpretable character archetypes. Our experiments demonstrate that strategies evolved under chaotic conditions exhibit superior resilience and present distinct behavioral phenotypes, ranging from Ruthless Capitalists to Diplomatic Enforcers. These phenotypes are readily classified by LLMs but remain nearly impossible to interpret through manual genome inspection alone. This work bridges evolutionary computation with explainable AI and provides a template for automated agent characterization in multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2506.22537v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The increasing number of detailed exoplanet observations offers an opportunity to refine our analyses and interpretations. Here, we show that atmospheres that appear volatile-rich and/or cloudy may instead be helium-rich. As transmission spectra constrain the atmospheric scale height ($H$), a He-enriched atmosphere can be misinterpreted as H$_2$-dominated water-rich to bring the mean molecular weight ($\mu$) to intermediate values ($\sim$4$-$10) when He/H$_2$ is fixed. Similarly, a cloud deck can reduce the spectral features, and thus the apparent (i.e., cloud-free equivalent) $H$. We present a proof-of-concept reanalysis of HD~209458~b&#x27;s JWST transmission spectrum treating He/H$_2$ as a free parameter, resulting in sets of He-rich solutions. We argue that He enhancement must be considered to reliably constrain atmospheric composition, be sensitive to a more diverse planetary population, and ultimately yield robust trends to inform formation and evolution pathways. Looking ahead, we suggest leveraging insights from differences in pressure-broadening effects, outflow measurements, and atmospheric chemistry to disentangle reliably between He-, volatile-rich, and cloudy atmospheres -- while recognizing that associated models need targeted upgrades to reach the fidelity level required to this end.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2401.17901v4 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The microscopic structure of several amorphous substances often reveals complex patterns such as medium- or long-range order, spatial heterogeneity, and even local polycrystallinity. To capture all these features, models usually incorporate a refined description of the particle interaction that includes an ad hoc design of the inside of the system constituents, and use temperature as a control parameter. We show that all these features can emerge from a minimal athermal two-dimensional model where particles interact isotropically by a double-well potential, which includes an excluded volume and a maximum coordination number. The rich variety of structural patterns shown by this simple geometrical model apply to a wide range of real systems including water, silicon, and different amorphous materials.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02539v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: While fluids near a solid surface are at the core of applications in energy storage/conversion, electrochemistry/electrowetting and adsorption/catalysis, their nanoscale behavior remains only partially deciphered. Beyond conventional effects (e.g. adsorption/reaction, interfacial transport, phase transition shifts), recent experimental and theoretical studies on metallic surfaces have unraveled exotic peculiarities such as complex electrostatic screening, unexpected wetting transition, and interfacial quantum friction. These novel features require developing and embarking new tools to tackle the coupling between charge relaxation in the metal and molecular behavior in the vicinal fluid. Here, using the concept of Virtual Thomas-Fermi fluids, we employ a molecular simulation approach to investigate interfacial transport of fluid molecules and metal charge carriers at their interface--including the underlying electrostatically-driven dynamic friction and the coupling between charge current/hydrodynamic flow (the so-called electrohydrodynamic drag). While conventional numerical techniques consider either insulating materials or metallic materials described as polarizable, non-conducting media, our atom-scale strategy provides an effective yet realistic description of the solid excitation spectrum--including charge relaxation modes and conductivity. By applying this approach to water near metallic surfaces of various electrostatic screening lengths, we unveil a non-monotonous dependence of the fluid/solid friction on the metallicity with a maximum occurring as the charge dynamic structure factors of the solid and fluid strongly overlap. Moreover, we report a direct observation of the electrohydrodynamic drag which arises from the momentum transfer between the solid and liquid through dynamic electrostatic interactions and the underlying interfacial friction.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02699v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Heat dissipation is ubiquitous in living systems, which constantly convert distinct forms of energy into each other. The transport of thermal energy in liquids and even within proteins is well understood but kinetic energy transfer across a heterogeneous molecular boundary provides additional challenges. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations under steady-state conditions to analyze how a protein dissipates surplus thermal energy into the surrounding solvent. We specifically focus on collective degrees of freedom that govern the dynamics of the system from the diffusive regime to mid-infrared frequencies. Using a fully anharmonic analysis of molecular vibrations, we analyzed their vibrational spectra, temperatures, and heat transport efficiencies. We find that the most efficient energy transfer mechanisms are associated with solvent-mediated friction. However, this mechanism only applies to a small number of degrees of freedom of a protein. Instead, less efficient vibrational energy transfer in the far-infrared dominates heat transfer overall due to a large number of vibrations in this frequency range. A notable by-product of this work is a highly sensitive measure of deviations from energy equi-partition in equilibrium systems, which can be used to analyze non-ergodic properties.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2504.00210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Stochastic quantum trajectories, such as pure state evolutions under unitary dynamics and random measurements, offer a crucial ensemble description of many-body open system dynamics. Recent studies have highlighted that individual quantum trajectories also encode essential physical information. Prominent examples include measurement induced phase transitions, where a pure quantum state corresponding to fixed measurement outcomes (trajectories) exhibits distinct entanglement phases, depending on the measurement rate. However, direct observation of this effect is hindered by an exponential post-selection barrier, whereby the probability of realizing a specific trajectory is exponentially small. We propose a deterministic method to efficiently prepare quantum trajectories in polynomial time using imaginary time evolution and, thus, overcome this fundamental challenge. We demonstrate that our method applies to a certain class of quantum states, and argue that there does not exist universal approaches for any quantum trajectories. Our result paves the way for experimentally exploring the physics of individual quantum trajectories at scale and enables direct observation of certain post-selection-dependent phenomena.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.14154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: A variational formulation for non-equilibrium thermodynamics was developed by Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura. In a recent article, the first two authors of the present paper introduced partially cosymplectic structures as a geometric framework for thermodynamic systems, recovering the evolution equations obtained variationally. In this paper, we develop a discrete variational principle for adiabatically closed simple thermodynamic systems, which can be utilised to construct numerical integrators for the dynamics of such systems. The effectiveness of our method is illustrated with several examples.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02539v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: While fluids near a solid surface are at the core of applications in energy storage/conversion, electrochemistry/electrowetting and adsorption/catalysis, their nanoscale behavior remains only partially deciphered. Beyond conventional effects (e.g. adsorption/reaction, interfacial transport, phase transition shifts), recent experimental and theoretical studies on metallic surfaces have unraveled exotic peculiarities such as complex electrostatic screening, unexpected wetting transition, and interfacial quantum friction. These novel features require developing and embarking new tools to tackle the coupling between charge relaxation in the metal and molecular behavior in the vicinal fluid. Here, using the concept of Virtual Thomas-Fermi fluids, we employ a molecular simulation approach to investigate interfacial transport of fluid molecules and metal charge carriers at their interface--including the underlying electrostatically-driven dynamic friction and the coupling between charge current/hydrodynamic flow (the so-called electrohydrodynamic drag). While conventional numerical techniques consider either insulating materials or metallic materials described as polarizable, non-conducting media, our atom-scale strategy provides an effective yet realistic description of the solid excitation spectrum--including charge relaxation modes and conductivity. By applying this approach to water near metallic surfaces of various electrostatic screening lengths, we unveil a non-monotonous dependence of the fluid/solid friction on the metallicity with a maximum occurring as the charge dynamic structure factors of the solid and fluid strongly overlap. Moreover, we report a direct observation of the electrohydrodynamic drag which arises from the momentum transfer between the solid and liquid through dynamic electrostatic interactions and the underlying interfacial friction.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding and establishing design principles to tune the excited states of earth-abundant sensitizers is crucial for identifying new photosensitizers for sustainable technological advancements. Here, we report a series of three bis Zr (IV) complexes of tridentate, dianionic ligands incorporating two phenoxide donors and aza arene acceptors of increasing electron affinity (pyridine &lt; pyrimidine &lt; pyrazine ) that are air and water-stable. These complexes emit via thermally assisted delayed fluorescence from an intraligand charge transfer excited state with varying metal contributions. The electronic structural changes from different acceptors vary the excited state character and the photophysical properties significantly between the complexes. The variation in photophysics that includes emission lifetime (76 μs to 265 ns), intersystem crossing (ISC) lifetime ( 390 – 290 ps), and the energy difference between the singlet and triplet excited states (∆EST. 170 -100 meV). We observe solvent-independent ISC rates when the excited state has metal contributions (acceptor = pyridine), and the ISC rates vary significantly with solvent polarity when the excited state is an intra-ligand charge transfer state (acceptor = pyrimidine and pyrazine). Transient absorption measurements provided the basis spectra and verified the metal contribution in the excited state. This work provides a basis for developing new sensitizers based on Zr (IV) by providing design principles that can be used to modulate the character of the excited state and its photophysics.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The axial ligand of heme is a key determinant of reactivity in heme-dependent enzymes, yet its systematic engineering remains challenging due to the limited chemical diversity of natural amino acids. Here, we demonstrate that replacing the native histidine axial ligand with a non-natural analog provides an effective strategy to regulate heme enzyme activity. By site-specifically incorporating δVin-H into APEX2, we reprogrammed the electronic structure of the heme center and unlocked catalytic activity toward aromatic amine substrates. Directed evolution of the APEX2-VinH enzyme yielded APEX3-VinH, which exhibits a pronounced enhancement in catalytic efficiency and robustness for aromatic amine oxidation. Notably, optimization of the δVin-H synthetase enabled highly efficient incorporation. This work establishes axial ligand engineering via genetic code expansion as a general and powerful strategy to reprogram the catalytic repertoire of heme enzymes, with broad implications for biocatalysis and the development of next-generation proximality labeling tools.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cellular membranes have diverse phospholipids, chemical differences in whose headgroups impact many biological processes. Phosphatidylcholine is an essential phospholipid for human health, but not universally required for life. The evolutionary mechanisms underlying phospholipid preferences remain poorly understood, due to the difficulty of investigating metabolite structure-activity relationships in a cellular context. Here, we developed a generalizable metabolic-rewiring method to manipulate phospholipid headgroups together and their biological effects. This approach utilizes synthetic media to hijack evolutionarily conserved phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, leveraging xenobiotics as principal precursors for scalable headgroup transformations. By identifying over 100 artificial headgroups, we expanded the chemical diversity of xenobiotic phospholipids. Unexpectedly, we discovered that subtle headgroup alterations produced distinct mammalian cellular activities. We demonstrated that chemical headgroup modifications differentially elicited structure-dependent effects on phospholipid-protein interactions, calcium dynamics, transcriptomic profiles, and stem cell differentiation. Notably, cross-species comparison revealed that human and yeast cells have different headgroup preferences critical for cell life and death. As proof-of-concept, interactome analysis identified headgroup-sensitive human microproteins vital for mitochondrial respiration, but non-conserved in yeast. These results exemplify the evolutionary diversity of key phospholipid-protein interactions, illustrating why humans depend on phosphatidylcholine. Overall, our findings establish a programmable platform for elucidating and engineering phospholipid-driven cellular functions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This mouse meiosis study identifies a SYCP2 closure motif that recruits HORMAD2 to unsynapsed chromosome axes, enabling ATR-mediated synapsis checkpoint signaling, but it has minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research beyond general DNA biology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Faithful chromosome segregation during meiosis depends on accurate recombination and synapsis of homologous chromosomes. These processes are monitored in mammals by checkpoint mechanisms involving the meiotic HORMA-domain proteins HORMAD1 and HORMAD2, which bind unsynapsed chromosome axes and promote activation of the DNA damage-response kinase ATR independently of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, no mechanism for axis recruitment of HORMAD1 or HORMAD2 had been demonstrated, nor had its role in checkpoint function been tested. We establish that a putative HORMAD-interacting region--the closure motif (CM)--within the chromosome-axis component SYCP2 is selectively required for HORMAD2, but not HORMAD1, localization. Deletion of the SYCP2 CM disrupts SYCP2-HORMAD2 complexes and prevents HORMAD2 axis binding without affecting axis assembly or recombination. Consequently, ATR accumulation and signaling on unsynapsed axes are reduced, and the prophase checkpoint malfunctions in a sexually dimorphic manner--causing aberrant elimination of synapsis-proficient spermatocytes and persistence of asynaptic oocytes. The phenotypes of SYCP2-CM-deficient and HORMAD2-null mice are indistinguishable, establishing the requirement for HORMAD2 axis recruitment in synapsis surveillance. We propose that axial recruitment generates a HORMAD2 scaffold that drives clustering-mediated ATR network activation independently of DSBs, thereby linking chromosome-axis architecture to synapsis quality control in mammalian meiosis.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This preprint identifies an SLBP-independent mechanism (PETISCO–TOST-1) that stabilizes maternal replication-dependent histone mRNAs in C. elegans and suggests this machinery was later co-opted for piRNA biogenesis, offering limited indirect relevance to molecular evolution rather than origins-of-life.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Replication-dependent (RD) histones are crucial for packaging newly replicated DNA into chromatin, ensuring genome stability. In metazoans, the mRNA of RD histones is uniquely regulated through a conserved 3&#x27; stemloop bound by stemloop binding protein (SLBP). This allows cell cycle-coupled regulation of these important transcripts. However, oocytes must stabilise histone mRNAs independently of the cell cycle to ensure maternal loading to support the first embryonic divisions. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system, we discovered an SLBP-independent mechanism that ensures RD histone transcript stability during oogenesis. This is mediated by the protein complex PETISCO, bound to the effector protein TOST-1, which directly binds the histone stemloop region and maintains maternal histone mRNA levels during oogenesis and early embryogenesis. Loss of this mechanism disrupts histone homeostasis, leading to premature genome activation, mitotic defects, and embryonic lethality. Interestingly, the same complex, PETISCO, acts in piRNA biogenesis when bound to the effector PID-1, revealing an intriguing co-option of this histone mRNA homeostasis mechanism by the piRNA pathway. Our findings reveal a unique SLBP-independent mechanism of histone mRNA regulation, that served as a basis for the evolution of a novel piRNA biogenesis mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Coding and non-coding RNAs have traditionally been viewed as functionally distinct entities. Here, we found that the down-regulation of Pink1 due to Tet2 knockout (KO) in muscle cells resulted in mitochondria dysfunction and muscle fatigue. Surprisingly, both Pink1 mRNA alone and untranslatable ATG-deficient Pink1 RNA were sufficient to rescue the mitochondria defects in Tet2 KO cells. PINK1 protein was fast degraded shortly after translation and dispensable for functions of Pink1 mRNA in muscle cells. Moreover, a portion of Pink1 mRNA was located in mitochondria and interacted directly with mitochondria inner membrane located protein YME1L1, promoting its proteolytic cleavage of Opa1, a master regulator of mitochondria fusion, to generate the mature protein form. These findings uncovered a bona fide non-coding role for a canonical mRNA, suggesting that translation independent functions could be present in mRNAs with coding potentials, blurring the conventional dichotomy between coding and non-coding RNAs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Even in the absence of mutagenic factors, spontaneous errors in DNA replication generate genetic diversity in microbial populations. The spontaneous mutation rate is not immutable but may be conditionally elevated. However, it remains unresolved whether apparently non-stressful nutritional or genotypic conditions affect the spontaneous mutation rate. Here, we determined the spontaneous mutation rate of haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK113-7D in three nutritional and three genotypic conditions. The nutritional and genotypic conditions influenced the specific growth rate of the S. cerevisiae population. Thus, we extended the established fluctuation assay for spontaneous mutation rate determination with CAN1 as a reporter gene to populations with different generation times. We applied the method to determine the spontaneous mutations rates in wild type S. cerevisiae grown on glucose and ammonium, raffinose and ammonium, and glucose and L-tryptophan as sole carbon and nitrogen sources. Alike we determined the spontaneous mutation rates of two engineered S. cerevisiae strains (i.e., representing genotypic conditions different from wild type) on glucose and ammonium medium. The engineered strains had two to three heterologous or variant genes integrated into the genome, common to simple heterologous small molecule production host strains. In all alternative nutritional and genotypic conditions, the spontaneous mutation rate of S. cerevisiae was reduced compared to wild type growing on glucose and ammonium medium. Spontaneous mutation rate is fundamentally relevant for evolvability of strains, but it may also influence the performance robustness of microbial populations in applications such as food or beverage fermentation or biotechnological chemical production. Our novel findings are important for biotechnological processes using microbial cells, often engineered and cultivated in unnatural chemical environments.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> FOF1-ATP synthase is one of the most abundant proteins of the mitochondrial inner membrane and the primary enzyme responsible for ATP production in eukaryotic cells. Nevertheless, it was recently reported to play a prominent role in cell death by forming a large-conductance leak channel in the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), making it a promising therapeutic target. Bedaquiline (BDQ), a member of the diarylquinoline class of drugs, was shown to selectively inhibit the catalytic activity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ATP synthase with no effect on the mammalian enzyme. Here, we report a new role for BDQ as a potent inhibitor of the ATP synthase c-subunit leak channel in mammals. BDQ inhibited the single-channel activity of porcine heart ATP synthase in planar lipid bilayer recordings and prevented glutamate-induced cell death in primary hippocampal neurons. These findings reveal the potential new application of BDQ for treating mPTP-related diseases by targeting the ATP synthase c-subunit leak channel.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Clinical biomarker study identifying circulating miR-4532 changes associated with ambulation status in dysferlinopathy patients, with minimal relevance to origins-of-life beyond involving RNA biology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Background: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) are inherited myopathies characterized mainly by progressive weakness of the proximal muscles of the shoulder and pelvic girdle areas, leading to functional decline and eventual loss of independent ambulation. Dysferlinopathy (LGMD2B) is an autosomal recessive LGMD subtype, is caused by mutations in the DYSF gene that lead to lack of dysferlin which results in muscle death and chronic muscle fiber degeneration. Preservation of ambulation is a key clinical milestone, as loss of independent gait markedly reduces quality of life and complicates care management. Although patients often perceive functional decline before their initial clinical presentation, current clinical assessments typically detect disease progression after substantial muscle damage has occurred. Methods: In this multigroup case-control study, we profiled plasma miRNAs from 49 genetically confirmed dysferlinopathy patients (24 ambulatory, 25 non-ambulatory) and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Total RNA was extracted from blood samples and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 3.1 arrays. After quality control and filtering, differential expression analysis was performed using linear models for microarrays, adjusting for age and sex, with a false discovery rate cutoff of 10%. Results: 14 miRNAs were significantly altered between dysferlinopathy patients and controls. Notably, miR-4532 was upregulated in ambulatory patients relative to controls, whereas it was downregulated in non-ambulatory patients compared with ambulatory patients, although expression levels remained higher than in controls. Levels of miR-4532 were positively associated with circulating monocyte levels in ambulatory patients only.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> A review arguing that water can actively enhance and reshape organic reactivity (e.g., hydrophobic-effect rate boosts, micellar catalysis, bioconjugation), offering broad-context relevance to origins-of-life by underscoring plausible aqueous reaction networks even though it is not directly focused on prebiotic/abiogenesis chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> For over a century, synthetic chemistry demanded the rigorous exclusion of water, relying on toxic, volatile organic solvents. This paradigm, while successful, is environmentally and economically costly. This review advocates for a fundamental shift: adopting water not just as a green solvent, but as a transformative medium that reshapes our understanding of reactivity and bridges chemistry with biology. Aqueous phase organic synthesis (APOS) has evolved from accidental observations to a deliberate discipline. Water’s unique properties—its high polarity, hydrogen-bonding capacity, and the hydrophobic effect—make it an active participant. This effect drives reactant aggregation and stabilizes transition states, leading to dramatic rate enhancements in pericyclic and condensation reactions. A broad range of reactions thrive in water, including classical carbon–carbon bond-forming reactions like the aldol and Diels–Alder, and modern cross-couplings (e.g., Suzuki–Miyaura) enabled by water-tolerant catalysts. Multicomponent and click chemistries are particularly powerful. Challenges like poor solubility are addressed with micellar catalysis, water-soluble ligands, and precise control of the reaction microenvironment. Beyond sustainability, APOS drives discovery, often yielding improved selectivities, new pathways, and streamlined syntheses of complex targets like pharmaceuticals. Its greatest promise lies in interfacing with biology. Bioorthogonal reactions, such as azide–alkyne cycloadditions, enable labeling and imaging in living organisms. Aqueous compatibility is essential for in situ therapeutic strategies, chemical biology, and advanced bioconjugation techniques for modifying biomolecules. The future converges with emerging technologies: machine learning to navigate complex aqueous systems, flow chemistry for scalability, and the integration of enzymatic with synthetic catalysis. This points toward a unified chemical-biological engineering paradigm. In conclusion, APOS is a mature, versatile field. It is a cornerstone of green chemistry and a critical bridge to biology, accelerating progress in medicine and materials science. Embracing water is both an environmental imperative and a strategic pathway to the next generation of scientific discovery. Introduction: The Solvent Problem in Organic Synthesis For generations, organic synthesis has been defined by precise control over molecular structure carried out in rigorously dried environments. Since the emergence of modern organic chemistry in the nineteenth century, water – the very medium that sustains life – has been regarded as an obstacle to chemical transformation. This long-standing assumption has shaped laboratory routines, industrial manufacturing, and chemical education, reinforcing the idea that successful synthesis depends on strict exclusion of moisture. This introduction revisits that historical mindset, evaluates its environmental and economic consequences, and presents the case for a fundamental transition toward aqueous phase organic synthesis (APOS) as a more suitable platform for future chemical and biological innovation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Clusteroluminescence (CL) refers to a newly emerging luminescence phenomenon observed in non-conjugated structures, particularly aliphatic polymers, which inherently exhibit good biocompatibility and processability. However, precise manipulation of CL properties, such as emission wavelength and efficiency, remains a critical challenge in this field. In this work, we propose methylation as an effective strategy to enhance inter- and intrachain through-space conjugation (TSC), thereby significantly increasing CL intensity. We preliminarily suggest that methylation disrupts hydrogen bonding, liberating the lone-pair n electrons of heteroatoms to participate in n-electron-involved TSC. We believe that methylation may evolve into a general and powerful approach for regulating the CL behavior of polymers, especially in nucleic acid systems.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Review of porous biopolymer–MOF composite materials for practical water-treatment performance (transport, fouling, regeneration), with only tangential relevance to origins-of-life via general water/materials context.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Porous biopolymer platforms integrated with metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) pair the processability of polymer networks with the high surface area and tunable chemistry of MOFs, but reported performance is often difficult to compare across studies due to inconsistent metrics, idealized batch testing, and limited attention to transport, regeneration, and matrix effects. This review evaluates porous biopolymer–MOF composites from a platform-level perspective, emphasizing how architecture, MOF placement, and operating mode shape performance under realistic constraints rather than isolated adsorption capacities. Performance trends are synthesized across major contaminant classes (heavy metals, dyes, pharmaceuticals, and PFAS), focusing on dominant interaction mechanisms and the penalties imposed by diffusion limitations, fouling, and competitive solutes. Regeneration and durability are treated as central determinants of viability, alongside leaching risk and water-matrix realism. To improve comparability and translation, a minimum reporting framework is proposed, specifying essential parameters for both batch and flow systems. Overall, the review provides a structured basis to judge when porous biopolymer–MOF composites justify added complexity for sustainable water treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nonadiabatic effects arising from conical intersections between excited states play a crucial role in the optical properties of a wide range of chromophores and have to be accounted for in first-principles modeling of spectral lineshapes. In this work, we investigate the importance of nonadiabatic effects in the absorption spectra of indole and cyanoindole derivatives by contrasting three modeling approaches. In the Gaussian Condon and Gaussian Non-Condon Theory formalisms, the linear response function is computed from excitation energy fluctuations of independent adiabatic excited states sampled along molecular dynamics trajectories, with the latter approach additionally including transition dipole moment fluctuations to account for Herzberg- Teller-type effects. In contrast, the tensor network-based T-TEDOPA approach allows for numerically exact quantum dynamics simulations of explicitly coupled diabatic excited states. We find that only the explicit coupling of the two lowest-lying excited states, La and Lb, within the T-TEDOPA approach yields accurate absorption spectra for all systems, while an adiabatic treatment underestimates spectral contributions from excitations into states with highly mixed electronic character. We further elucidate the role of polar solvent stabilization of the charge-transfer character La state by comparing indole in vacuum and in water, showing that solvent effects significantly shape the ultrafast population transfer between excited states and contribute to the differences in the experimental absorption lineshapes. Finally, we discuss the influence of cyano substituent position on the optical properties of cyanoindole derivatives through changes in the energy ordering of La and Lb, their relative transition dipole moments, and stabilization of the charge-transfer state in polar solvent.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Mouse exercise physiology study showing intermittent AP-1 (cFos/JunD) activation drives beneficial muscle and metabolic adaptations, with no direct relevance to origins-of-life or astrobiology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Regular physical exercise extends healthspan, yet the molecular mechanisms that translate intermittent contractile stress into lasting benefit remain incompletely understood. Using global nuclear run-on (GRO-seq) in mouse skeletal muscle after treadmill running, we profiled enhancer RNA (eRNA), a sensitive marker of enhancer activity. Activation protein-1 (AP-1), a family of pioneering factors for senescence, emerged as the top transcription factor with motif enrichment in exercise-activated enhancers. Our screen in the contracting C2C12 myotubes pinpointed cFos/JunD as the primary AP-1 factor responsible for contraction-induced transcriptional changes. Muscle-specific overexpression of A-Fos, a dominant-negative mutant of cFos, disrupted transcriptomic responses to exercise and attenuated exercise-mediated improvement in muscle functions. Interestingly, intermittent but not continuous overexpression of cFos/JunD in mouse muscles mimicked exercise-induced transcriptomic changes, increased mitochondrial volume density, enhanced muscle strength and fatigue resistance, and improved glucose tolerance. These results define a transcriptional regulatory signaling pathway linking exercise intermittency to beneficial adaptations and highlight the necessary recovery cycles in training. The paradoxical anti- and pro-aging roles of AP-1 offer insights into the timing and dynamics of stressors and stress responses in shaping senescence and healthspan.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We report high figure-of-merit optical leaf sensors based on dielectric metasurfaces and stimuli-responsive polymers. The metasurfaces have narrowband resonances and are broadly transparent across the visible spectrum to allow photosynthesis for unobstructive monitoring of crop health. These sensors are fabricated at scale using direct nanoimprint lithography into UV curable-TiO2 nanocrystal (NC) inks to structure optical metasurfaces, followed by a room-temperature ligand exchange process to create a nanoporous TiO2 scaffold. The nanoporous TiO2 metasurfaces are then infiltrated by a stimuli-responsive polymer while retaining their geometry and optical quality. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate optical humidity sensors by incorporating the moisture-responsive chitosan biopolymer into the nanoporous TiO2 metasurfaces, resulting in a 430 % improvement in sensitivity compared to conventional RI sensors where the polymer surrounds the metasurface. The sensors are mounted on leaves and the highly reflective resonances, which are readily distinguishable from the leaf background, respond dynamically to leaf water stress, enabling passive, battery-free monitoring of leaf surface humidity.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Neuronal function requires precise long-distance axonal transport mediated by molecular motors and RNA-binding proteins like SFPQ, though regulatory mechanisms remain poorly defined. We identify long non-coding RNA NORAD as a master regulator of this process through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). While SFPQ and kinesin-1 mediate cargo delivery, the specific RNA coordinating their interaction was unknown. We demonstrate NORAD directly binds kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1) and promotes SFPQ condensation into dynamic LLPS droplets, enabling efficient transport. CRISPR-assisted mapping and functional assays show NORAD depletion disrupts granule dynamics, impairs neuroprotective mRNA localization, and induces axonal degeneration. In vitro reconstitution confirms NORAD-KLC1 synergy enhances SFPQ phase separation, and neuron-specific knockout mice exhibit motor deficits with reduced neuronal density. These findings establish the first evidence of lncRNA NORAD-mediated LLPS in axonal transport, revealing a new paradigm for RNA-guided neuronal maintenance.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Materials-engineering study demonstrating single-step interfacial self-assembly of graphene networks templated by water-in-oil emulsions to create conductive, piezoresistive silicone foams, with only limited indirect relevance to origins-of-life self-assembly phenomena.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Segregated network composites achieve electrical percolation at minimal filler loadings by localizing conductivity to architectural boundaries. However, achieving this architecture typically requires tedious multi-step processing, often incompatible with scalable manufacturing. Here, we report the single-step synthesis of a silicone composite segregated network composed of self-assembled percolating graphene networks. These networks are templated by graphene-stabilized water-in-oil emulsions, created by spontaneous exfoliation of graphite at oil/water interfaces generated by agitation. After polymerization of the silicone and removal of the dispersed aqueous phase, the resulting foams achieve conductivities of 0.43 S/m at a 1.37 vol% loading of graphene. This is a 12-fold reduction compared to prior interfacial assembly methods, which require 16.5 vol% loading and thousands of hours of processing to achieve comparable electrical conductivity. Architectural segregation decouples mechanical and electrical properties, enabling application-specific modulus tuning. The foams exhibit reversible piezoresistance with a U-shaped strain response, are stable through 5000 cycles, and provide voltage-controlled heating to 143 °C at milliamp current densities, three orders of magnitude lower than those of continuous CVD graphene networks. The low thermal mass of the air-filled foam structure provides rapid thermal response, achieving 28-second de-icing from -17 °C.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> An interdisciplinary book proposing a framework linking information dynamics with energy across biology, physics, and economics, offering broad conceptual context but little direct engagement with origin-of-life mechanisms or prebiotic chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The scientific understanding of energy, matter, and spacetime has advanced rapidly, whereas the study of information—its properties, behavior, and dynamics—remains underdeveloped. Despite the complexity of knowledge and information, our conceptual and empirical grasp of its evolution lags significantly behind. Progress in disciplines such as artificial intelligence, genomics, cognitive science, cyber governance, global ecology, and quantum mechanics depends critically on a more rigorous understanding of information dynamics. Absent such insight, humanity risks succumbing to entropic forces that threaten systemic stability and long-term survival. In this book, Klaus Jaffe addresses the limitations of prior treatments of infodynamics, many of which have been incomplete, imprecise, or conceptually flawed. It offers an interdisciplinary investigation into the relationship between information and energy, drawing on theoretical and empirical contributions from economics, biology, and physics. By challenging conventional paradigms, the book constructs a conceptual framework that bridges disparate scientific domains and societal processes. The resulting synthesis opens new avenues for empirical inquiry and policy-relevant research, with implications for both academic scholarship and public discourse. Inviting readers to explore the evolving frontier of information science, the book highlights the role of information and its impact on both natural and social systems. More at: link.springer.com</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Demonstrates a reversible-flow electrochemical cell design for ocean-water CO2 removal with reduced mass-transfer limitations and in-situ precipitate cleaning to sustain stable energy intensity, but it has minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Our study focuses on an experimental demonstration of a novel method for CO2 removal from ocean water that combines H2 and redox salt looping to induce pH swings in electrochemical flow cells. Model-driven design optimization guides 3-D printed electrolyte flow channel designs to alleviate mass-transfer limitations. A ridged flow channel with 1 mm thick fins protruding at an angle of 30◦ from the base reduces ferri-/ferro-cyanide redox salt diffusion boundary layer thickness by up to 41% while restricting pressure drop to less than 138 Pa. A notable feature of this work is the experimental validation of the intrinsic in-situ cleaning capabilities enabled by the reversible looping process, eliminating what would otherwise be process down time. Over 4 acidification/basification cycles, 86% removal of fouling from electrode surfaces is demonstrated, while distinctly maintaining a constant electrochemical energy intensity. The lab-scale, proof-of-concept experimental demonstration show promising results, which are interpreted to provide insights and guidelines towards further enhancing scalability and efficiency of oceanic carbon removal and utilization processes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The emergence of polar nematic phases, such as the ferroelectric (N F ) and antiferroelectric (N X ) phases, has opened new frontiers in soft matter science. However, the relationship between molecular structure, intermolecular interactions, and the resulting macroscopic order remains poorly understood. This work investigates the molecular organization in the polar nematic phases of the nJK (n=1-5) homologous series using a combined approach of polarized Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, and Atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations. A central finding is the inadequacy of single-molecule DFT models to describe the system. While DFT accurately predicts vibrational band positions, it fails to replicate their experimental intensities, suggesting that intermolecular interactions are dominant. This is further corroborated by the anomalous temperature dependence of the average absorbance for parallel and perpendicular vibrations, which deviates significantly from simple density effects. Atomistic MD simulations of a multi-molecule system provide insight into this behavior, revealing the formation of locally ordered nanodomains driven by strong short- range correlations. Experimentally, we quantified the primary nematic order parameter (S), which follows a typical progression in the N phase but shows anomalous changes at the N-N X and N X -N F transitions, ultimately saturating at a high value of S ≈ 0.7 in the ferroelectric state. The difference between orthogonal absorbance components for perpendicular vibrations reveals a significant biaxiality order parameter (C) that increases upon cooling and exceeds 1 in the N F phase. This study demonstrates that the unique properties of polar nematics are governed by specific molecular self-assembly and establishes phase biaxiality as a key feature of these systems.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Single-molecule (UMI-corrected) sequencing resolves ultra-low-frequency mutations within influenza RNA quasi-species, quantifying intra-host genetic diversity and selective constraints with information-theoretic metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Influenza viruses exhibit high mutation rates and extensive genetic diversity, which hinder effective vaccine development and facilitate immune evasion (Taubenberger and Morens, 2006; Barr et al., 2010). These mutations arise from the error-prone viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, generating highly heterogeneous viral populations within individual hosts that conform to the quasi-species model of a cloud of related genomes evolving under selection (Domingo et al., 2012). Accurate characterization of this intra-host diversity is crucial for understanding viral evolution and improving vaccine design, yet conventional RNA sequencing often fails to detect low-frequency variants because of technical errors during sample preparation and sequencing. Here, we implement a single unique molecular identifier strategy that reduces sequencing artifacts and achieves an error rate of ~10⁻⁵, enabling single-particle–level quantification of quasi-species diversity. Mutation frequencies greatly exceeding background error confirm their biological origin, while information-theoretic metrics such as Shannon entropy and Jensen–Shannon divergence reveal non-random mutation distributions under selective constraints. This framework supports detailed studies of intra-host viral evolution and may inform artificial intelligence-driven prediction of mutational trajectories and more effective influenza vaccine strategies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Enantioselective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) has great synthetic potential, but the de novo design of chiral HAT catalysts is challenging. We report a conceptually distinct approach in which chiral HAT catalysts are generated in situ through non-covalent self-assembly of privileged chiral phosphoric acids and commercial 2-mercaptopyridines. The phosphoric acid serves as a modular chiral source that renders the achiral thiol effectively chiral, enabling a previously inaccessible combinatorial space of chiral HAT catalysts. This platform enabled the photochemical deracemization of 2-aryl pyrrolidines, a prevalent scaffold in active pharmaceutical ingredients. Optical enrichment proceeds via enantioselective hydrogen atom relay, in which a single chiral assembly orchestrates both hydrogen atom abstraction and delivery. This concept of relaying chiral information via non-covalent assembly holds broad potential for asymmetric radical catalysis.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01468v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The rapid depletion of dust particles in protoplanetary disks limits the time available for planetesimal formation, as solids are typically accreted onto the central star before dust particles can undergo substantial growth. Dust traps formed at sharp viscosity transitions $-$ such as at the edges of the accretionally inactive dead zones $-$ can halt radial drift and enhance dust coagulation. In this study, dust dynamics is investigated using \texttt{RAPID}, a one-dimensional Lagrangian-Eulerian simulation code that tracks representative particle trajectories over time. In order to explore the effect of physical parameters on dust evolution, a grid of 243 models was run. The simulation grid covers a range of parameters such as viscosity, width of the transition region at the edges of the dead zone, disk surface density exponent, and the collisional fragmentation velocity of the dust particles. The computational domain extends from 1 to 50 AU and covers $5\times10^5$ years of disk evolution, assuming a disk mass of $\sim 0.005\,M_\odot$. The results show that pressure maxima can trap up to $3-10\,M_\oplus$ of dust, depending on the local disk conditions. However, increasing the fragmentation velocity, decreasing the viscosity, or widening the dead zone transition width tends to reduce the effectiveness of dust trapping. The simulation results with \texttt{RAPID} reveal that dust evolution is highly sensitive to the physical conditions of the disk, which governs the early stages of planetesimal growth.</p>

We use the Atmospheric Big Challenge (ABC) database, a publicly available dataset with over 100,000 simulated exoplanet spectra, to construct an anomaly detection scenario by defining CO2-rich atmospheres as anomalies and CO2-poor atmospheres as the normal class. We benchmarked four different anomaly detection strategies: Autoencoder Reconstruction Loss, One-Class Support Vector Machine (1 class-SVM), K-means Clustering, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). Each method was evaluated in both the original spectral space and the autoencoder&#x27;s latent space using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics. To test the performance of the different methods under realistic conditions, we introduced Gaussian noise levels ranging from 10 to 50 ppm. Our results indicate that anomaly detection is consistently more effective when performed within the latent space across all noise levels. Specifically, K-means clustering in the latent space emerged as a stable and high-performing method. We demonstrate that this anomaly detection approach is robust to noise levels up to 30 ppm (consistent with realistic space-based observations) and remains viable even at 50 ppm when leveraging latent space representations. On the other hand, the performance of the anomaly detection methods applied directly in the raw spectral space degrades significantly with increasing the level of noise. This suggests that autoencoder-driven dimensionality reduction offers a robust methodology for flagging chemically anomalous targets in large-scale surveys where exhaustive retrievals are computationally prohibitive.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00962v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The giant planet-metallicity correlation revealed that planetary formation depends on the stellar properties. There is growing evidence that it is also valid for smaller hot planets, but it is not clear whether elements other than iron also influence the properties of planetary systems. To investigate this, we determined the abundances of 13 chemical elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni and Cu) for a sample of 561 Kepler exoplanet-hosting stars using high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectra. We find that stars in systems having only large or hot planets are enriched in some elements relative to those having only small or warm planets, respectively, with this signature being related to the underlying stellar metallicity. This Kepler sample is composed of stars belonging to the Galactic low- and high-$\alpha$ sequences, corresponding to the chemical thin and thick disks. Our results reveal that stars enhanced in $\alpha$-elements may facilitate the formation of large planets in metal-poor environments although the iron abundance is still a limiting factor. We also investigated chemical abundances as a function of elemental condensation temperatures and found that there is a diversity of slopes of regardless of the exoplanetary systems hosted by the star. We confirmed that the Sun is depleted in refractory elements relative to the solar twins in our sample, all of which host a diversity of exoplanets, suggesting that this depletion is caused by processes not related to planet formation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2508.04828v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Humans stand alone in terms of their potential to collectively and cumulatively change their culture in an open-ended manner. This open-endedness provides societies with the ability to continually expand their resources and to increase their capacity to store, transmit and process information at a collective-level. Here, we propose that the production of resources arises from the interaction between cultural systems (a society&#x27;s repertoire of interdependent techniques, artifacts, norms and knowledge) and search spaces (an ensemble of needs, problems and goals facing a society). Starting from this premise we develop a macro-level model wherein both cultural systems and search spaces are subject to evolutionary dynamics. By manipulating the extent to which these dynamics are characterised by stochastic or selection-like processes, we demonstrate that open-ended growth is extremely rare, historically contingent and only possible when cultural systems and search spaces co-evolve. Here, stochastic factors must be strong enough to continually perturb the dynamics into a far-from-equilibrium state, whereas selection-like factors help maintain effectiveness and ensure the sustained production of resources. Only when this co-evolutionary dynamic maintains effective cultural systems, supports the ongoing expansion of the search space and leads to an increased provision of resources do we observe open-ended cultural evolution.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01795v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We present a new framework for analyzing the evolution of information in geophysical systems. Understanding how information, and its counterpart, uncertainty, propagates is central to predictability studies and has significant implications for applications such as forecast uncertainty quantification and risk management. It also offers valuable insight into the underlying physics of the system. Information propagation is closely linked to causality: how one part of a system influences another, and how some regions remain dynamically isolated. We apply this framework to the one-dimensional, highly nonlinear Kuramoto-Sivashinsky model and to the shallow-water equations, representing a mid-latitude atmospheric strip. Notably, we observe that information can propagate against the fluid flow, and that different model variables exhibit distinct patterns of information evolution. For example, pressure-related information propagates differently from relative vorticity, reflecting the influence of gravity waves versus balanced flow dynamics. This new framework offers a promising addition to the diagnostic tools available for studying complex dynamical systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2505.11411v5 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Understanding neural network&#x27;s (NN) generalizability remains a central question in deep learning research. The special phenomenon of grokking, where NNs abruptly generalize long after the training performance reaches a near-perfect level, offers a unique window to investigate the underlying mechanisms of NNs&#x27; generalizability. Here we propose an interpretation for grokking by framing it as a computational glass relaxation: viewing NNs as a physical system where parameters are the degrees of freedom and train loss is the system energy, we find memorization process resembles a rapid cooling of liquid into non-equilibrium glassy state at low temperature and the later generalization is like a slow relaxation towards a more stable configuration. This mapping enables us to sample NNs&#x27; Boltzmann entropy (states of density) landscape as a function of training loss and test accuracy. Our experiments in transformers on arithmetic tasks suggests that there is NO entropy barrier in the memorization-to-generalization transition of grokking, challenging previous theory that defines grokking as a first-order phase transition. We identify a high-entropy advantage under grokking, an extension of prior work linking entropy to generalizability but much more significant. Inspired by grokking&#x27;s far-from-equilibrium nature, we develop a toy optimizer WanD based on Wang-landau molecular dynamics, which can eliminate grokking without any constraints and find high-norm generalizing solutions. This provides strictly-defined counterexamples to theory attributing grokking solely to weight norm evolution towards the Goldilocks zone and also suggests new potential ways for optimizer design.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2506.16060v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Atmospheric observations by JWST raise a growing evidence that atmospheric metallicity exhibits an anti-correlation with masses of giant exoplanets. While such a trend was anticipated by planetesimal-based planet formation models, it remains unclear what kind of atmospheric metallicity trends emerge from pebble-based planet formation. Moreover, while recent studies of solar system Jupiter suggest that uppermost observable atmosphere may not represent the bulk envelope composition, it remains uncertain how the envelope inhomogeneity influences the atmospheric metallicity trend. In this study, we develop disk evolution and planet formation models to investigate the possible atmospheric metallicity trends of giant exoplanets formed via pebble accretion and how they depend on the metallicity inhomogeneity within the envelope. We find that pebble-based planet formation produces two distinct mass-metallicity relations depending on planetary birthplace. Planets formed beyond the H2O snowline exhibit a mass-metallicity anti-correlation similar to that predicted by planetesimal-based models if their atmospheres are fully convective. This anti-correlation disappears if the convective mixing is inefficient. In contrast, planets formed inside the H2O snowline show a shallower mass-metallicity anti-correlation, regardless of the efficiency of atmospheric mixing. Many gas giants observed by JWST observations lie around the mass-metallicity relation predicted for formation at close-in orbits, although some planets with sub-stellar atmospheric metallicity appear to require unmixed envelopes and formation beyond the H2O snowline. We also examine the relationship between bulk and atmospheric metallicity and find a clear correlation that closely follows atmospheric metallicity that is comparable to bulk metallicity.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02344v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The evolution of planet-forming regions in protoplanetary disks is of fundamental importance to understanding planet formation. Disks with a central deficit in dust emission, a &quot;cavity&quot;, have long attracted interest as potential evidence for advanced disk clearing by protoplanets and/or winds. Before JWST, infrared spectra showed that these disks typically lack the strong molecular emission observed in full disks. In this work, we combine a sample of 12 disks with millimeter cavities of a range of sizes ($\sim2$-70 au) and different levels of millimeter and infrared continuum deficits. We analyze their molecular spectra as observed with MIRI on JWST, homogeneously reduced with the new JDISCS pipeline. This analysis demonstrates a stark dichotomy in molecular emission where &quot;molecule-rich&quot; (MR) cavities follow global trends between water, CO, and OH luminosity and accretion luminosity as in full disks, while &quot;molecule-poor&quot; (MP) cavities are significantly sub-luminous in all molecules except sometimes OH. Disk cavities generally show sub-luminous organic emission, higher OH/H$_2$O ratios, and suggest a lower water column density. The sub-thermal excitation of CO and water vibrational lines suggests a decreased gas density in the emitting layer in all cavities, supporting model expectations for C$_2$H$_2$ photodissociation. We discover a bifurcation in infrared index (lower in MR cavities) suggesting that the molecular dichotomy is linked to residual $\mu$m-size dust within millimeter disk cavities. Put together, these results suggest a feedback process between dust depletion, gas density decrease, and molecule dissociation. Disk cavities may have a common evolutionary sequence where MR switch into MP over time.</p>

We examine the possible roles of planetary interiors, tectonic regimes, continental coverage, volatile cycling, magnetic fields, and atmospheric composition and evolution in shaping long-term climate stability and biospheric potential. Comparisons with Earth and other planets in the Solar System highlight the diversity of planetary conditions and the rarity of conditions relevant to life. We also discuss contingency and convergence in planetary and biological evolution as they relate to the spread of life in the universe. The observational limits of current and planned missions are assessed, emphasizing the need for models that connect internal dynamics to detectable atmospheric and surface signatures as well as the need for laboratory measurements of planetary properties under a wide range of conditions. The large number of exoplanets promises opportunities for empirical and statistical studies of processes that may have occurred earlier in Earth&#x27;s history, as well as of the other pathways rocky planets and biospheres may take. Thus, exo-geoscience provides a framework for interpreting exoplanet diversity and refining strategies for detecting life beyond the Solar System.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01628v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Correctly interpreting JWST spectra of close-in exoplanets requires a measurement of the X-ray and ultraviolet light that the planets receive from their host stars. Here we provide spectral energy distributions (SEDs) covering the range $\approx5-1\times10^7$A for 20 transiting exoplanet host stars observed in JWST Cycle 1. The SEDs are constructed out of new and archival Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra X-ray Observatory and/or XMM-Newton data combined with spectra from models or stars with similar properties (proxies) filling in unobserved gaps. We have also constructed SEDs of likely Habitable Worlds Observatory targets $\kappa^1$ Ceti, $\tau$ Ceti, $\epsilon$ Indi and 70 Oph B for use as proxies. We find that the JWST target planets almost all experience much stronger ultraviolet fluxes than the Earth, especially in the extreme ultraviolet, even for planets with similar overall instellation. Strong ongoing or past atmospheric escape is possible for a majority of these planets. We also assess the now considerable sample of panchromatic stellar SEDs and its applicability for current JWST observations and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01020v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We study the influence of dissipation on the Ising-Gamma model. Through observables such as ground-state energy, order parameters, entanglement entropy, etc., we identify each phase region and provide the global phase diagram of the system. The results show that the region of the spiral phase will continuously expand with the increase of dissipation, gradually squeezing the original paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phase regions. Remarkably, unlike the conservative system, the introduction of dissipation will cause two spiral phases with opposite chiralities to emerge simultaneously in the system, which provides a possibility for the manipulation of spiral chirality in cold atomic experiments. Moreover, we reveal the mechanism of the dependence of the transformation between these two spiral phases with distinct chirality on the strength of the relative coefficient of off-diagonal Gamma interactions in the Ising-Gamma model. Since both the relevant order parameters and dissipation can be well controlled within a detectable range, these phenomena can be observed in ultracold atomic experiments.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.01231v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: With seven temperate Earth-sized planets revolving around an ultracool red dwarf, the nearby TRAPPIST-1 system offers a unique opportunity to verify models of exoplanet composition, differentiation, and interior structure. In particular, the low bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, compared to terrestrial planets in our solar system, require either substantial amount of volatiles to be present or a corefree scenario where the metallic core is fully oxidised. Here, using an updated metal-silicate partitioning model, we show that during core-mantle differentiation oxygen becomes more siderophile (iron-loving) implying larger planet radii. For the seven TRAPPIST-1 planets, however, we find that they are not sufficiently large to oxidise all the iron in the core, if they differentiate from an Earth-like composition. Oxygen partitioning in rocky worlds precludes coreless planets up to about 4 Earth masses. The observed density deficit in the TRAPPIST-1 planets, and more generally in M dwarf systems if confirmed by future observations, may be explained by system-dependent element budgets during planet formation, which are intrinsically linked to their stellar metallicity.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.15696v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Sprawling, turbulent cloud formations dominate the meteorology of Jupiter&#x27;s mid-to-high latitudes, known as Folded Filamentary Regions (FFRs). A multi-wavelength characterisation by Juno reveals the spatial distribution, vertical structure, and energetics of the FFRs. The cloud tops display multiple lobes of stratiform aerosols, separated by darker, cloud-free lanes, and embedded with smaller eddies and high-altitude cumulus clouds. These cyclonic FFRs are microwave-bright in shallow-sounding wavelengths ($p&lt;5$ bars) and microwave-dark in deep-sounding wavelengths ($p&gt;10$ bars), with the transition potentially associated with the water condensation layer (6-7 bars). Associating microwave contrasts with temperature anomalies, this implies despinning of cyclonic eddies above/below their mid-planes. Despite deep roots (being detectable in wavelengths sounding $\sim100$ bars), they are ``pancake vortices&#x27;&#x27; with horizontal extents at least an order of magnitude larger than their depth. In the northern hemisphere, FFRs are most common in cyclonic belts poleward of $40^\circ$N (all latitudes are planetocentric), particularly a North Polar Filamentary Belt (NPFB) near $66-70^\circ$N that defines the transition from organised belts/zones to the chaotic polar domain. This distribution explains the high lightning rates from $45-80^\circ$N, peaking in a belt poleward of $52.3^\circ$N, which may trace the availability of water for moist convection. Many observed lightning flashes can be associated to specific FFRs containing bright storms, but some FFRs display no activity, suggesting quiescent periods during storm evolution. Analogies to Earth&#x27;s oceanic eddies suggest that cyclones deform isentropic surfaces at their midplanes, raising deep water-rich layers upwards to promote moist convection, release latent heat, and inject clouds into the upper troposphere.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00944v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Subatomic particles can interact with target nuclei in matter or decay in flight, and an individual high-energy particle can induce a particle shower composed of numerous, lower-energy secondaries. These particle showers broadly exhibit universality across diverse media, including air, water, ice, and other materials, with their development governed by the Standard Model. Full Monte Carlo simulation of particle showers, where each secondary is individually tracked and propagated, can be a computational challenge to perform at scale. Experiments thus resort to parametrized approximations when efficient simulation becomes necessary. Here, we construct distributions of parameters capable of describing the Cherenkov light yield from particle showers in ice, and extensible to other, similar media. Sampling from the distributions allows for a much improved description of event-to-event fluctuations, in amplitude and shape, along the shower axis. Including these effects is essential for a more accurate simulation of signal and background events in current and next-generation neutrino telescopes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02291v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We investigate the angle of repose ${\theta}_r$ of dense suspensions of colloidal silica particles ($d = 2$ $\mu m$ to $7$ $\mu m$) in water-filled microfluidic rotating drums experiments, to probe the crossover between the thermal (colloidal) and athermal (granular) regimes. For the smallest particles, thermal agitation promotes slow creep flows, and piles always flatten completely regardless of their initial inclination angle, resulting in ${\theta}_r = 0$. Above a critical particle size, piles of colloids stop flowing at a finite angle of repose, which increases with particle size but remains below the minimal value expected for athermal frictionless granular materials: $0 &lt; {\theta}_r &lt; {\theta}_{ath} \approx 5.8{\deg}$. We quantify the arrest dynamics as a function of the gravitational P\&#x27;eclet number $Pe_g$, which characterizes the competition between particle weight and thermal agitation. Our measurements are consistent with a recent rheological model [Billon et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids 8, 034302, 2023], in which the arrested state stems from a crossover between glass-like and jamming-dominated regimes as the granular pressure in the pile increases relative to the thermal pressure.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01572v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Self-propelled particles rarely move in straight lines; environmental interactions, shape asymmetry, and intrinsic torques generically induce curved or fluctuating trajectories. In biological and synthetic systems, this curvature often coexists with directional sensing and non-reciprocal interactions. Motivated by this, we explore the collective dynamics of chiral intelligent active Brownian particles (iABPs) that combine polar alignment with vision-based sensing. By varying the ratio of alignment to visual maneuverability, the vision angle, and the reduced chirality $(\omega/D_r)$, we construct a phase diagram exhibiting diverse collective states: spinners, vortices, ripples, worm-like swarms, rotary clusters, and irregular aggregates. Chirality critically governs their morphology: high chirality yields dilute phases, while moderate to low chirality produces cohesive yet dynamic patterns. Ripple loops emerge as a distinct state, characterized by expanding ring-like motion driven by outward torques and sustained only when both particle number and visual maneuverability are large. Structural and dynamical measures, including polarization, pair correlations, mean-square displacement, and orientation correlations, reveal clear signatures distinguishing these phases. Overall, our results show how chirality, non-reciprocal perception, and alignment together generate collective states inaccessible to non-chiral systems, with implications for chiral active matter in biological and synthetic contexts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01018v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: RNA velocity is an important model that combines cellular spliced and unspliced RNA counts to infer dynamical properties of various regulatory functions. Despite its wide applicability and many variants used in practice, the model has not been adequately designed to directly account for both intracellular gene regulatory network interactions and spatial intercellular communications. Here, we propose a new RNA velocity approach that jointly and directly captures two new network structures: an intracellular gene regulatory network (GRN) and an intercellular interaction network that captures interactions between (neighboring) cells, with relevance to spatial transcriptomics. We theoretically analyze this two-level network system through the lens of control and consensus theory. In particular, we investigate network equilibria, stability, cellular network consensus, and optimal control approaches for targeted drug intervention.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00976v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We present neutrino-transport algorithms implemented in the toolkit for high-order neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics (thornado) and their coupling to self-gravitating hydrodynamics within the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)-based multiphysics simulation framework Flash-X. thornado, developed primarily for simulations of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), employs a spectral, six-species two-moment formulation with algebraic closure and special-relativistic observer corrections accurate to $O(v/c)$, and uses discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for phase-space discretization combined with implicit-explicit time stepping. A key development is a nonlinear neutrino-matter coupling algorithm based on nested fixed-point iteration with Anderson acceleration, enabling fully implicit treatment of collisional processes, including energy-coupling interactions such as neutrino-electron scattering and pair production. Coupling to finite-volume (FV) hydrodynamics is achieved with a hybrid DG-FV representation of the fluid variables and operator-split evolution in Flash-X. The implementation is verified using basic transport tests with idealized opacities and relaxation and deleptonization problems with tabulated microphysics. Spherically symmetric CCSN simulations demonstrate accuracy and robustness of the coupled scheme, including close agreement with the CCSN simulation code Chimera. An axisymmetric CCSN simulation further demonstrates the viability of DG-based neutrino transport for multidimensional supernova modeling within Flash-X. thornado&#x27;s neutrino-transport solver is GPU-enabled using OpenMP offloading or OpenACC, and all CCSN applications included in this work use the GPU implementation. Together, these results establish a foundation for future enhancements in physics fidelity, numerical algorithms, and computational performance, for increasingly realistic large-scale CCSN simulations.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01909v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We investigate the evolution of anisotropies in Bianchi I spacetimes within the framework of the 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar field theory. The field equations are formulated using dimensionless variables, and the asymptotic dynamics are studied through a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. For the locally rotationally symmetric case, we analytically explore the stationary points of the field equations. The analysis reveals the existence of accelerating solutions in which the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet scalar effectively play the role of a cosmological constant. As a result, both anisotropic and isotropic expanding solutions are recovered, along with the Minkowski spacetime. No scaling solutions are supported by the gravitational model. For the general anisotropic Bianchi I geometry with three distinct scale factors, we find that a class of compactified Kasner-like solutions is obtained. In addition, a new family of solutions follows, describing a two-dimensional splitting of the background geometry. This behavior is similar to the previously observed pure Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in higher-dimensional spacetimes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01159v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Rigorous quantum dynamics calculations provide essential insights into complex scattering phenomena across atomic and molecular physics, chemical reaction dynamics, and astrochemistry. However, the application of the gold-standard quantum coupled-channel (CC) method has been fundamentally constrained by a steep cubic scaling of computational cost [${O}(N^3)$]. Here, we develop a general, rigorous, and robust method for solving the time-independent Schr\&quot;odinger equation for a single column of the scattering S-matrix with quadratic scaling [${O}(N^2)$] in the number of channels. The Weinberg-regularized Iterative Series Expansion (WISE) algorithm resolves the divergence issues affecting iterative techniques by applying a regularization procedure to the kernel of the multichannel Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation. The method also explicitly incorporates closed-channel effects, including those responsible for multichannel Feshbach resonances. We demonstrate the power of this approach by performing rigorous calculations on He + CO and CO + N$_2$ collisions, achieving exact quantum results with demonstrably quadratic scaling. Our results establish a new computational paradigm, enabling state-to-state quantum scattering computations for complex molecular systems and providing a novel window onto the intricate multichannel molecular collision dynamics.</p>

One useful tool to describe them is the so-called Choi isomorphism, which maps completely positive transformations to positive semi-definite matrices. Accordingly, there are numerous proposals to generalize the Choi isomorphism. In the present paper, we show that the 1976 paper of Gorini, Kossakowski and Sudarshan (GKS) already holds the key for a further generalization and study the resulting GKS isomorphism. As an application, we compute the GKS matrix of the time evolution of a general open quantum system up to second order in time.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01071v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: This paper establishes a robust link between quantum dynamics and classical ones by deriving probabilistic representation for both continuous time and discrete time quantum walks. We first adapt Molchanov formula, originally employed in the study of Schrodinger operators on multidimensional integer lattice, to characterize the evolution of continuous time quantum walks. Extending this framework, we develop a probabilistic method to represent discrete time quantum walks on an infinite integer line, bypassing the locality constraints that typically inhibit direct application of Molchanov formula. The validity of our representation is empirically confirmed through a benchmark analysis of the Hadamard walk, demonstrating high fidelity with traditional unitary evolution. Our results suggest that this probabilistic lens offer a powerful alternative for learning multidimensional quantum walks and provides new analytical pathways for investigating quantum systems via classical stochastic processes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2506.09190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Recent developments have extended the concept of global symmetries in several directions, offering new perspectives across a wide range of physical systems. This work shows that generalized global symmetries naturally emerge in shallow water systems. In particular, we demonstrate that two subsystem symmetries-previously studied primarily in exotic field theories-arise intrinsically in the dynamics of shallow water flows. A central result is that the local conservation of potential vorticity follows directly from the first subsystem symmetry, revealing that the classic Kelvin circulation theorem is rooted in these symmetries. Notably, the associated charge algebra forms a Kac-Moody current algebra, with the level determined by the spatial variation of the Coriolis parameter. Beyond the first subsystem symmetry, we also identify a second one, construct the corresponding Noether charges, and explore their potential applications.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Develops a spectral framework for weighted Weyl fractional operators to model aging, infinite-memory systems and analytically explains an &quot;amnesia&quot; transition from power-law to exponential relaxation, with minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02142v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: This paper establishes a rigorous spectral framework for the Weighted Weyl Fractional Calculus, designed to model non-local systems exhibiting aging and subjective time scales. By constructing a conjugation map involving a time-dependent weight $\omega(t)$ and a scale function $\psi(t)$, we define a new class of fractional operators that preserve the spectral tractability of time-invariant systems. We derive the Spectral Mapping Theorem for these operators and prove that Weighted Mittag-Leffler functions act as their fundamental eigenfunctions, demonstrating that the Weighted Fourier Transform naturally diagonalizes the associated evolution equations. As a physical application, we formulate a constitutive law for aging viscoelastic materials with infinite memory. Crucially, we analytically demonstrate the &quot;Amnesia Phenomenon&quot;: we prove that rapid aging modulates the system&#x27;s history, effectively transforming the hereditary power-law decay into a short-range exponential relaxation. This result provides a closed-form explanation for the loss of memory in fast-aging media, overcoming the computational bottlenecks of standard discretization methods.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2508.04828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Humans stand alone in terms of their potential to collectively and cumulatively change their culture in an open-ended manner. This open-endedness provides societies with the ability to continually expand their resources and to increase their capacity to store, transmit and process information at a collective-level. Here, we propose that the production of resources arises from the interaction between cultural systems (a society&#x27;s repertoire of interdependent techniques, artifacts, norms and knowledge) and search spaces (an ensemble of needs, problems and goals facing a society). Starting from this premise we develop a macro-level model wherein both cultural systems and search spaces are subject to evolutionary dynamics. By manipulating the extent to which these dynamics are characterised by stochastic or selection-like processes, we demonstrate that open-ended growth is extremely rare, historically contingent and only possible when cultural systems and search spaces co-evolve. Here, stochastic factors must be strong enough to continually perturb the dynamics into a far-from-equilibrium state, whereas selection-like factors help maintain effectiveness and ensure the sustained production of resources. Only when this co-evolutionary dynamic maintains effective cultural systems, supports the ongoing expansion of the search space and leads to an increased provision of resources do we observe open-ended cultural evolution.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01159v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Rigorous quantum dynamics calculations provide essential insights into complex scattering phenomena across atomic and molecular physics, chemical reaction dynamics, and astrochemistry. However, the application of the gold-standard quantum coupled-channel (CC) method has been fundamentally constrained by a steep cubic scaling of computational cost [${O}(N^3)$]. Here, we develop a general, rigorous, and robust method for solving the time-independent Schr\&quot;odinger equation for a single column of the scattering S-matrix with quadratic scaling [${O}(N^2)$] in the number of channels. The Weinberg-regularized Iterative Series Expansion (WISE) algorithm resolves the divergence issues affecting iterative techniques by applying a regularization procedure to the kernel of the multichannel Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation. The method also explicitly incorporates closed-channel effects, including those responsible for multichannel Feshbach resonances. We demonstrate the power of this approach by performing rigorous calculations on He + CO and CO + N$_2$ collisions, achieving exact quantum results with demonstrably quadratic scaling. Our results establish a new computational paradigm, enabling state-to-state quantum scattering computations for complex molecular systems and providing a novel window onto the intricate multichannel molecular collision dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01572v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Self-propelled particles rarely move in straight lines; environmental interactions, shape asymmetry, and intrinsic torques generically induce curved or fluctuating trajectories. In biological and synthetic systems, this curvature often coexists with directional sensing and non-reciprocal interactions. Motivated by this, we explore the collective dynamics of chiral intelligent active Brownian particles (iABPs) that combine polar alignment with vision-based sensing. By varying the ratio of alignment to visual maneuverability, the vision angle, and the reduced chirality $(\omega/D_r)$, we construct a phase diagram exhibiting diverse collective states: spinners, vortices, ripples, worm-like swarms, rotary clusters, and irregular aggregates. Chirality critically governs their morphology: high chirality yields dilute phases, while moderate to low chirality produces cohesive yet dynamic patterns. Ripple loops emerge as a distinct state, characterized by expanding ring-like motion driven by outward torques and sustained only when both particle number and visual maneuverability are large. Structural and dynamical measures, including polarization, pair correlations, mean-square displacement, and orientation correlations, reveal clear signatures distinguishing these phases. Overall, our results show how chirality, non-reciprocal perception, and alignment together generate collective states inaccessible to non-chiral systems, with implications for chiral active matter in biological and synthetic contexts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01536v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The resting voltage, $V$, which is the potential drop required to nullify the electrical current ($i=0$), is a key characteristic of water desalination and energy harvesting systems that utilize macroscopically large nanoporous membranes, as well as for physiological ion channels subjected to asymmetric salt concentrations. To date, existing analytical expressions for $V_{i=0}$ have been limited to simple scenarios. In this work, we derive a universal, self-consistent theoretical model, devoid of unnecessary oversimplifying assumptions, that unifies all previous models within a single framework. This new model, verified by non-approximated numerical simulations, predicts the behavior of $V_{i=0}$ for arbitrary concentration gradients and for arbitrary diffusion coefficients and ionic valences. We show how the interplay between diffusion coefficients and ionic valencies significantly varies the system response and why it is essential to account for all system parameters. Ultimately, this model can be used to improve experimental interpretation of ion transport measurements.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02086v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The liquid-vapor critical behavior of water is strongly influenced by both ionic solutes and confinement. Molecular dynamics simulations of aqueous NaCl solutions using the TIP4P/2005 water model and the Madrid-2019 ion parameters reveal a systematic increase in the liquid-vapor critical temperature and pressure with salt concentration, consistent with experimental trends. In contrast, confinement between parallel hydrophobic plates leads to a depression of the critical point. The critical temperature was determined from the Binder cumulant crossing in the NVT ensemble, using a recently developed method originally applied to an active Brownian particle system. The reliability of this approach was verified through complementary NPT simulations. We further demonstrate the pronounced sensitivity of the estimated critical point to the van der Waals cutoff distance, underscoring the importance of properly accounting for long-range interactions. Our framework, which employs and tests an adjusted subbox method, can be readily extended to other critical phenomena, including the liquid-liquid critical point of water.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02132v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal evolution of radiolytic species created by high-energy electrons in water underpins key applications from radiotherapy and nuclear safety to environmental processing and electron microscopy. Here, using the Manchester Inhomogeneous Radiation Chemistry by Linear Expansions (MIRaCLE) toolkit, we introduce and benchmark a novel approach to simulating these processes. Although the initial conditions are determined stochastically, the subsequent time evolution is calculated deterministically using a continuum representation, derived from those initial conditions. This hybrid approach essentially averages over many chemistry ``trajectories&#x27;&#x27; simultaneously, often converging to the 1% level in one shot, not requiring multiple runs. We demonstrate this new approach through the calculation of time-dependent G-values for e_{aq}^-$, \dot{\mathrm{OH}} and other radiolytic products, including at unprecedented dose rates where calculations which would take years with a conventional Monte Carlo approach can be performed in mere hours on a commercial laptop. We demonstrate that the main artifact of continuum modelling can be mitigated by a correction term. These results establish MIRaCLE as a flexible and efficient platform for modelling long-timescale radiolysis, providing a bridge between Monte Carlo approaches and macroscopic reaction--diffusion schemes, with broad implications for radiation chemistry in medicine, energy, and materials science.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.24900v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: A capacitor consisting of the [bmim][NTf$_2$] ionic liquid (IL) confined in between planar graphite electrodes has been investigated by molecular dynamics based on an all-atom, unpolarizable force field. Structural and dynamical properties such as: (i) the density and orientation of the [bmim]$^+$ and [NTf$_2$]$^-$ ions throughout the capacitor; (ii) the electrostatic double layer at the electrode / electrolyte interface; (iii) the ions&#x27; mobility perpendicular and parallel to the graphite plates are determined as a function of the electrostatic charge of the capacitor, the concentration of absorbed water, the temperature and pressure. Grouping the [bmim]$^+$ and [NTf$_2$]$^-$ ions into neutral ion pairs reveals an intriguing ordering normal to the interface that is related to correlations among the dipole moments of the neutral ion pairs. These correlations might explain the observation of an anomalous Stark effect (Pockels effect) reported a few years ago in Langmuir, vol. 37, 5193-5201, (2021), and provides useful insight for the multitude of electro-chemical applications that involve electrode / ionic liquid interfaces.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper provides key hypotheses to guide future missions to Enceladus for the current decadal cycle and beyond. Enceladus is a high priority target for the fields of astrobiology and planetary science because it contains the three basic ingredients for life as we understand it: organic materials, a liquid solvent, and an energy source.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Culture-based survey of cyanobacteria, green algae, and fungi in low-light subaerial cave biofilms, offering an astrobiology-relevant analog for microbial persistence and potential biosignature formation in dark, humid environments rather than a direct origins-of-life study.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Caves and hypogean environments provide stable microclimates characterized by uniform temperatures, constant humidity, and low light levels. In such sites, extremely low light irradiance can support the growth of subaerial biofilms (SABs) dominated by unique photosynthetic communities of cyanobacteria accompanied by chlorophytes, heterotrophic bacteria, and fungi. This study aimed to apply a culture‐dependent approach to […] The post A Glimpse Into Darkness: Diversity Of Culturable Cyanobacteria, Green Algae And Fungi From Subaerial Cave Biofilms appeared first on Astrobiology .</p>
