<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Storage of biological materials is essential for medical, research, and biotechnological applications. While cold-chain preservation is effective, it is costly, infrastructure-dependent, and vulnerable to disruption. Room-temperature dry storage, inspired by desiccation-tolerant organisms, provides an alternative by stabilizing biomolecules in vitrified (glass-like) matrices that limit molecular motion which if not reduced can lead to breakdown and loss of integrity. Trehalose is widely used as a vitrifying agent, but its protective capacity depends on glassy properties shaped by drying methods, environmental conditions, storage duration, and the type of preserved molecule. Systematic studies linking these factors to short and long-term stability remain limited. Here, we examine how drying conditions and storage duration influence the stability of DNA, RNA, and enzymes in vitrified trehalose systems. DNA remained stable under all conditions, independent of trehalose or drying parameters, reflecting its intrinsic resistance to desiccation-induced damage. RNA showed moderate sensitivity to drying without trehalose but was stabilized in its presence, although RNA integrity did not consistently correlate with measured vitrified properties. In contrast, enzymes were highly sensitive to drying without trehalose and were strongly protected under conditions that promoted favorable vitrified properties. Enzyme protection after 30 minutes correlated with high glass transition temperature. However, during prolonged drying, increased glass transition temperature was inversely correlated with enzyme protection and was a better indicator of detrimental physical aging of the vitrified system. These findings present the first insight into how drying methods, environmental conditions, and storage duration shape vitrified properties and stability. They guide optimization of room-temperature preservation.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study dissects how the eukaryotic Integrator subunit INTS12 modulates NELF–RNAPII pausing to prevent release of defective transcription complexes, a mechanistic advance in transcription regulation but with minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Promoter-proximal RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) pausing and the processivity are controlled by distinct modules of the Integrator complex, which together fine-tune transcription and protect against the accumulation of defective RNAPII complexes. Compromised activity of individual Integrator modules has been linked to human disease including cancer and developmental disorders, caused by defective transcription of protein-coding or small-nuclear RNAs. Despite extensive characterisation of the Integrator complex both genetically and structurally, the role of smallest member of the complex, INTS12, has remained enigmatic. Here, we uncover that INTS12 loss acts to stabilise the association between NELF and Integrator via its PHD domain and N-terminus, respectively, thus safeguarding against the release of defective RNAPII complexes. Acute degradation of INTS12 results in the selective dissociation of Integrator from the NELF-RNAPII complex which subsequently convert to their canonical paused form from which they can be released by CDK9. In the absence of INTS12 excess release of defective RNAPII via P-TEFb/SEC, loss of the ARMC5 salvage pathway and deletion of the catalytic and core Integrator subunits is toxic to cells. These findings demonstrate that there is interconversion between canonical paused RNAPII and paused-Integrator, and highlight the critical interplay between these processes and P-TEFb mediated pause-release to ensure that only transcription competent complexes are released into elongation.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Preprint reports a conserved, non-canonical role for dUTPase in regulating mitosis and centrosome/spindle integrity in Drosophila and mouse embryos, decoupling its essentiality from uracil-in-DNA repair (relevant mainly as general eukaryotic DNA biology rather than direct origins-of-life work).</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> dUTPase is universally regarded as a metabolic sanitizing enzyme that protects genomes by preventing the incorporation of uracil into DNA. Despite its essentiality across eukaryotes, no function beyond nucleotide sanitization has been demonstrated. Here, we uncover a conserved, non-canonical role for dUTPase as a regulator of mitosis. Using Drosophila and mouse models, we demonstrate that dUTPase loss causes early embryonic lethality characterized by severe mitotic failure that, cannot be rescued by disabling uracil-DNA repair, uncoupling dUTPase essentiality from DNA repair pathways. Mechanistically, dUTPase dynamically associates with the mitotic spindle and centrosomes, and its depletion induces centrosome amplification and chromosome segregation defects. Beyond cell division, dUTPase dosage bidirectionally controls cell migration, linking its mitotic function to cellular behaviors relevant for metastasis. Together, our findings redefine dUTPase as a moonlighting mitotic factor that coordinates centrosome integrity and spindle dynamics, expanding its known repertoire beyond nucleotide metabolism.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Using rapid degradation of CCR4-NOT subunits in human cells, the authors show this complex suppresses pervasive transcription and LINE retrotransposon activity by modulating KRAB-ZNF repression and promoting retrotransposon RNA decay.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> CCR4-NOT regulates multiple steps in gene regulation and has been well studied in budding yeast. Although primarily cytoplasmic, where it plays an essential role in mRNA degradation, the human complex has poorly characterized nuclear functions. Here, we used auxin-induced degradation to rapidly deplete the scaffold subunit CNOT1 and the E3 ligase CNOT4, and characterized the transcriptional functions of the human CCR4-NOT complex. Using transient transcriptome profiling (TT-Seq) to measure ongoing transcription, we found widespread activation of RNA synthesis in depleted cells across genic and intergenic regions. Interestingly, fewer genes were repressed, including KRAB-Zinc-Finger-protein (KZNF) genes, especially those on chromosome 19. KZNFs repress genes and retrotransposable elements (rTEs), and consistent with decreased KZNF expression, rTEs, mainly Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINEs), were activated. Full-length active LINEs and rTEs lying outside of genes were activated, suggesting that the increased transcription is not the direct result of transcription of the genes the rTEs are embedded in. We found that most activated transcription events were in proximity to KZNF binding sites, suggesting that KZNF regulation contributes to the suppression of genic and rTE transcription. Finally, we demonstrate that CCR4-NOT regulates the stability of rTE RNAs, indicating that the complex tightly controls transposon expression by repressing transcription and targeting their RNAs for decay.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This preprint shows that inosine misincorporation into mRNA (normally prevented by ITPase) activates the integrated stress response via PKR and induces an innate immune-like transcriptional program, highlighting how non-canonical nucleotides in RNA can act as a potent cellular stress signal.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPase) enzyme restricts levels of the non-canonical nucleotides (deoxy)inosine triphosphate (dITP/ITP) and prevents their aberrant misincorporation into nucleic acids. ITPase deficiency is associated with dilated cardiomyopathy and epileptic encephalopathy in humans and is usually fatal in infancy. It leads to pronounced inosine misincorporation into RNA but the cellular consequences of this misincorporation are not well understood and the pathogenic basis of ITPase deficiency remains unknown. Here we show that cellular transfection of mRNA with inosine misincorporation activates the integrated stress response (ISR) with an innate immune gene expression signature. This stress response triggers stress granule formation and is modulated by the double stranded RNA sensor protein Kinase R (PKR). Inosine nucleoside treatment of ITPase-deficient cells leads to endogenous inosine misincorporation into mRNA and activation of the ISR. Further, differentiation of human ITPase-deficient induced pluripotent stem cells into neurons results in a low-level stress response. Thus, our study establishes inosine misincorporation into mRNA as an unappreciated form of cellular stress. This is normally prevented by the ITPase enzyme, with implications for the pathogenesis of ITPase deficiency.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study dissects transient DNA-dependent dimerization and partner-assisted catalysis of the eukaryotic meiotic nuclease Spo11, offering mechanistic insight into modern DNA-processing complexes but with only indirect relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spo11 initiates meiotic recombination by introducing programmed DNA double-strand breaks. DNA cleavage occurs via a topoisomerase-like mechanism involving hybrid active sites formed at the dimer interface. However, in contrast to its topoisomerase relative (Topo VI), Spo11 does not form a stable dimer, likely to prevent uncontrolled DNA cleavage. Here, we investigated the dimerization of S. cerevisiae Spo11 in complex with its partners Ski8, Rec102, and Rec104. We show that the Spo11 complex dimerizes transiently on DNA, forming unstable dimeric complexes with duplex and branched DNA substrates. Guided by AlphaFold modeling of a pre-cleavage complex, we identified mutations that reduce dimerization. Surprisingly, DSB formation is resilient to mutagenesis of the Spo11 dimer interface, implying that additional factors promote dimerization in vivo. Finally, we found that Rec102 exerts a key DNA-binding function, essential for catalysis, and show that it also participates in dimerization through trans contacts with Ski8. Our work provides new insights into the mechanism of Spo11 dimerization and the role of its partners in initiating meiotic recombination.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Using targeted cytosine base-editing in native chromatin, the study shows that human MBD4 base-excision repair cooperates with a replication-independent, PMS1/MLH1-dependent non-canonical mismatch repair pathway to fix 5mC deamination (T:G) lesions, shaping CpG mutational patterns relevant to genome evolution and cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> CpG dinucleotides are hotspots for mutagenesis by spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) into thymine, resulting in T:G mismatches that can lead to C&gt;T transitions. These mutations are a hallmark of aging and cancer and a major force shaping the evolution of vertebrate genomes. We have previously uncovered MBD4 as the primary base excision repair (BER) glycosylase responsible for 5mC deamination repair. In this study, we employ a cytosine base-editing system, comprising an APOBEC1 deaminase fused to a catalytically dead Cas9, to induce targeted cytosine deamination in native chromatin and track its repair. This approach reveals that MBD4 cooperates with a non-canonical branch of mismatch repair (MMR) to elicit 5mC deamination repair. We demonstrate that MBD4 activity depends on MMR complexes MutS (MSH2-MSH6) and MutL{beta} (MLH1-PMS1), but not on post-replicative MMR elicited by the MutL (MLH1-PMS2) complex. We find that PMS1 loss phenocopies the genome-wide CpG&gt;TpG hypermutated profile associated with MBD4 deficiency, uncovering that 5mC deamination repair may represent one of the primary functions of the MutL{beta} complex. The mutational landscape of MMR-deficient tumors aligns with our experimental results, showing that replication-independent CpG&gt;TpG mutagenesis partly contributes to the mutational burden of tumors inactivated for MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6. Finally, using structural predictions alongside biochemical validation, we show that MBD4 physically interacts with MutL{beta} in an MLH1-dependent manner, illuminating the structural basis for the convergence of the BER and MMR pathways. Altogether, we uncover a novel function of non-canonical MMR that underscores its interplay with BER in safeguarding genomic integrity against damage to methylated DNA.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces PORTAL and CAP cloning to enable ultrahigh-complexity CRISPR perturbation libraries and large-scale genetic interaction mapping in human cells using quantitative RNA readouts, with minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> CRISPR screens have become essential tools for systematically probing gene function from basic biology to drug discovery, yet important frontiers remain beyond genome scale. Probing regulatory elements, interpreting genetic variants, and mapping genetic interactions all challenge the sensitivity and scalability of existing approaches. Here we introduce two synergistic technologies to address these limitations. PORTAL (Perturbation Output via Reporter Transcriptional Activity in Lineages) shifts pooled genetics toward quantitative RNA phenotypes, encoding perturbation effects in expressed transcripts to enable single-molecule measurements with lineage or single-cell resolution. CAP cloning (Covalently closed Assembly Products) bypasses bacterial transformation to enable construction of ultrahigh-complexity lentiviral libraries. Combining these advances, we construct a genetic interaction map spanning 665,856 pairwise perturbations across 46 million clonal lineages - the largest exhaustive map in human cells and the first at this scale using a non-fitness phenotype. More broadly, this work charts a path toward comprehensive genetic interaction mapping in human cells.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> During early embryonic development, cells transition from naive to primed pluripotent state. Various culture conditions have been established to revert primed cells back to naive state, to increase differentiation potential and to reset epigenetic abnormalities. In this study, we modified culture conditions to allow primed-to-naive conversion under feeder-independent and normoxic conditions (FINO medium), which exemplified the need for a quantitative measure of pluripotent states. DNA methylation (DNAm) profiling revealed extensive hypomethylation at naive state, but also significant gains of methylation at specific sites in the genome. We demonstrate that DNAm patterns can be used to benchmark culture protocols. Furthermore, we developed a naive-score based on DNAm at two genomic sites, which can be analyzed by digital PCR to monitor transition between pluripotent states. Our study describes a simplified culture protocol for primed-to-naive conversion, offers insights into the specific DNAm changes, and introduces a robust DNAm-based biomarker to track this process effectively.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This preprint uses AF4-SAXS, cryo-EM, and single-particle analyses to show that mRNA-loaded lipid nanoparticles form heterogeneous structural subpopulations whose internal organization and cargo uniformity correlate with transfection efficiency, offering indirect insights into nucleic-acid compartmentalization/self-organization rather than core origins-of-life mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Lipid nanoparticles are the leading platform for the delivery of nucleic acid therapeutics, yet their structural complexity remains a significant barrier to achieve rational design and predictable function. Part of this complexity arises from the non-equilibrium assemblies that are difficult to identify using ensemble average techniques given the substantial heterogeneity in all properties. Aiming to overcome the limitations of traditional characterization methods, we combined asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation with in-line small-angle X-ray scattering and spectroscopic analyses, nanoflow cytometry, and cryo-EM to construct detailed structural models of mRNA-loaded nanoparticles formulated with different amounts of mRNA loading (N/P ratios of 3 and 6). This combination of techniques revealed that microfluidic formulation produces structurally diverse nanoparticle subpopulations differing in size, anisotropy, and cargo loading. Notably, these variations extend to the particle internal organization: spheroidal geometries display densely loaded mRNA cores, whereas bleb-like morphologies exhibit reduced mRNA content relative to the lipid amount within segregated domains at the core. NanoFCM further shows that the N/P ratio modulates cargo distribution across individual nanoparticles, with N/P=6 yielding a more uniform mRNA copy number per particle across subpopulations than N/P=3. These differences resulted in higher transfection efficacies for the N/P=6 formulation, highlighting core organization and loading homogeneity as key parameters for efficacious delivery. Together, these results establish a direct link between LNP architecture, internal organization, cargo distribution, and transfection efficiency, underscoring the importance of accounting for heterogeneity in the rational design of nucleic acid delivery systems.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study reveals an ATM–RHEB–mTORC1–TFEB signaling axis linking DNA damage to lysosomal adaptation and recovery after genotoxic stress, offering cell-biology context but limited direct relevance to origins-of-life mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cells dynamically adapt to environmental stressors by rewiring signaling networks that coordinate growth, metabolism and genome maintenance. The DNA damage response (DDR) and mTORC1 signaling pathways govern DNA repair and cell growth, respectively, but how these pathways intersect remains incompletely understood. Here, we identify RHEB, the most direct mTORC1 activator, as a substrate of the DDR kinase ATM. Strikingly, we find that, although genotoxic stress differentially regulates mTORC1 activity, reducing the phosphorylation of its lysosomal target TFEB, while enhancing phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic target S6K, the DDR-induced phosphorylation of RHEB specifically controls the lysosomal mTORC1 signaling branch. Preventing RHEB phosphorylation impairs TFEB nuclear translocation and lysosome biogenesis upon DNA damage. Functionally, the RHEB phosphorylation-dependent TFEB response is required for proliferative recovery following genotoxic stress. These findings uncover an ATM-RHEB-mTORC1-TFEB signaling axis that links DNA damage to selective mTORC1 outputs, revealing a mechanism which enables cells to adapt to genotoxic cues.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Describes and phylogenetically places novel freshwater Mayorella (Amoebozoa) lineages from Ghana, expanding knowledge of cryptic eukaryotic diversity and evolutionary clade structure but with only indirect relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mayorella species are globally distributed amoeboid protists, yet their diversity remains poorly resolved due to pronounced morphological plasticity and limited molecular data. Freshwater ecosystems of West Africa are particularly underexplored, with virtually no taxonomic or molecular studies addressing Mayorella and most microbial eukaryotes diversity in the region. Here, we describe a new species of Mayorella isolated from Budamu Stream, Ghana, using an integrative morphological and molecular approach. Mayorella budamensis sp. nov. exhibits marked morphological plasticity in size, shape, locomotion, and floating forms. Phylogenetic analyses based on SSU rDNA place the new species within a well-supported Mayorella clade, clustering with geographically diverse but largely unnamed and uncultured lineages. Comparative sequence analyses confirm that M. budamensis sp. nov. is genetically distinct from all sequenced congeners recognized to date. In addition, a second Mayorella isolate recovered from the same locality forms a genetically distinct lineage associated primarily with environmental sequences, indicating a novel evolutionary group. Based on available SSU rDNA data, we recognize up to seven major clades within Mayorella, representing distinct evolutionary lineages with the potential to include additional undescribed species. Together, these findings reveal substantial cryptic diversity and expand the known distribution of Mayorella in understudied African freshwater ecosystems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The blood-brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain from substances in the circulation; yet, this barrier can be breached. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a disease in which over 50% of patients experience manifestations of neuropsychiatric lupus (NPSLE), with many displaying BBB dysfunction. High levels of TNF, IL-1{beta}, C5a, and epinephrine, which have all been shown to cause BBB permeability, may be present in the serum of SLE patients. Brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVECs) are a major structural element of the BBB. We asked whether BMVECs stimulated with barrier-disrupting factors release extracellular vesicles (EVs) which might participate in autocrine signaling or might have utility as diagnostic biomarkers of BBB permeability. We analyzed proteins in EVs secreted by unstimulated and stimulated BMVECs by mass spectrometry and used secreted EVs for further BMVEC stimulation. We subjected BMVECs to bulk RNA-seq to identify response signatures to the initial stimulus and to secondary stimulation with EVs. We show that there are agent-specific EV-associated protein profiles. EVs from BMVECs subjected to BBB-breaching stimuli alter the BMVEC transcriptional program, representing a potential feed-forward mechanism. Finally, we suggest that the proteins associated with EVs might be markers of BBB disruption.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> RNA remains a largely untapped target for covalent small-molecule intervention due to the lack of electrophiles with predictable reactivity and stability in biological settings. Here, a mechanistically defined and tunable class of epoxide- and aziridine-2-carboxamide electrophiles that enable structure-guided covalent targeting of RNA is described. These warheads arise from an unexpected hydrolytic rearrangement of 3-chloropivalamide precursors under physiological conditions and selectively react with guanine N7, with reactivity and stability controlled by substitution pattern, linkage chemistry, and stereochemistry. Application to two distinct RNA targets demonstrates generality: epoxide- and aziridine-based ligands covalently modify pathogenic r(CUG)exp repeat RNA and disrupt RNA-protein interactions in vitro and in cells, while structure-guided placement on a flavin scaffold yields stereoselective covalent modulators of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) riboswitch with validated reaction site and cellular activity.Together, this work establishes epoxide- and aziridine-2-carboxamides as a versatile platform for covalent RNA targeting and provides a general framework for the rational design of stereochemically controlled RNA-reactive small molecules</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Describes an in vitro workflow to generate metabolically and functionally mature bioengineered human skeletal muscle tissues for studying glucose metabolism, exercise-like adaptation, and pharmacological responses, with no direct relevance to origins-of-life or astrobiology topics.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Human skeletal muscle is a major regulator of whole-body metabolic homeostasis, yet mechanistic insight into human muscle plasticity is limited by the lack of in vitro models with adult-like metabolic and functional maturity. Here, we develop a workflow for generating bioengineered human skeletal muscle tissues that undergo coordinated structural, molecular, and functional maturation and stabilize in an adult-like state by day 21. Time-resolved RNA-seq and protein profiling reveal consolidation of contractile programs alongside progressive metabolic maturation, including increased mitochondrial electron transport chain content, mature mitochondrial network organization, and upregulation of glucose- and glycogen-handling proteins as well as muscle-enriched AMPK isoforms. Functionally, the tissues develop physiological force-frequency behavior, post-tetanic potentiation, and reproducible fatigue responses that are exacerbated by hypoxia and glucose withdrawal. Exercise-like chronic stimulation increases force and endurance with hypertrophy-like remodeling, and these adaptations reverse with detraining. The model also captures pharmacological responsiveness. Beta-adrenergic stimulation activates canonical signaling, increases force, limits disuse-related decline, and improves endurance in a glucose-dependent manner. Under physiological insulin and IGF-1 conditions, tissues show robust insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis, with punctate glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) localization. Finally, knockdown of muscle glycogen synthase (GYS1) preserves peak tetanic force but impairs endurance and force recovery under fuel stress, indicating that glycogen metabolism is a key determinant of human muscle resilience.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Food-science study showing alginate (and alginate+ascorbic acid) encapsulation improves the stability and controlled release of beetroot betalain pigments, with only tangential relevance to origins-of-life via general encapsulation chemistry in aqueous environments.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Betalains are natural, water-soluble pigments that are chiefly extracted from Beta vulgaris(beetroot) and have been widely researched as natural food colorants attributed to their natural coloring ability and antioxidant properties. On the other hand, their use is restricted by their poor stability response against exposure to natural elements like light, temperature fluctuations, oxygen, and changes in pH, which causes rapid decomposition of pigments and loss of coloration. The scope of this research is to improve the stability response of beetroot extracted betalain against natural element exposure by employing alginate encapsulation and co-encapsulation techniques with food-grade components. Betalain extracts for this research are conducted through a method of methanolic extraction, and the concentration of the pigment is measured by UV-Visible Spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 535 nm. The encapsulation method is performed through the ionotropic gelation method of sodium alginate and calcium chloride, while the co-encapsulation method is performed by embedding L-ascorbic acid, which is naturally recognized as a non-toxic natural antioxidant agent, within the sodium alginate matrix. The above systems were assessed for color retention upon storage, pH stability at an acidic pH of 3 and basic pH of 9, and controlled release properties, in an aqueous environment. The results showed that alginate encapsulation of the betalains increased the retention of color stability and pH stability significantly when compared to the free pigment. Alginate co-encapsulation of the betalains performed better in color stability and controlled release properties because of the reduced diffusion caused by the addition of ascorbic acid. Generally, alginate co-encapsulation of the betalains offers a sustainable and food-friendly approach for the stabilization of the betalains for application in food colorants and controlled release systems</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite remarkable advances in protein structure prediction, a fundamental question remains unresolved: how do proteins fold from unfolded conformations into their native states? Here, we introduce PathDiffusion, a novel generative framework that simulates protein folding pathways using evolution-guided diffusion models. PathDiffusion first extracts structure-aware evolutionary information from 52 million predicted structures the AlphaFold database. Then an evolution-guided diffusion model with a dual-score fusion strategy is trained to generate high-fidelity folding pathways. Unlike existing deep learning methods, which primarily sample equilibrium ensembles, PathDiffusion explicitly models the temporal evolution of folding. On a benchmark of 52 proteins with experimentally validated folding pathways, PathDiffusion accurately reconstructs the order of folding events. We further demonstrate its versatility across four challenging applications: (1) recapitulating Anton&#x27;s molecular dynamics trajectory for 12 fast-folding proteins, (2) reproducing functionally important local folding-unfolding transitions in 20 proteins, (3) characterizing conformational ensembles of 50 intrinsically disordered proteins, and (4) resolving distinct folding mechanisms among 3 TIM-barrel proteins. We anticipate that PathDiffusion will be a valuable tool for probing protein folding mechanisms and dynamics at scale.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> A large-scale phylogenetic and domain-architecture analysis of ~40,000 bacterial GH18 chitinases shows how coevolution between catalytic cores and auxiliary domains drives divergent evolutionary trajectories (high modular plasticity for environmental scavenging vs fixed architectures for lineage-specific developmental functions).</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The modular architecture of multi-domain enzymes is a key source of functional diversity. GH18 chitinases exemplify this, possessing a variety of auxiliary domains that have been postulated to underpin their role as essential global nutrient cyclers. However, there is no evolutionary framework that accounts for vast the assortment of domain compositions observed across the protein family. Here, we map the sequence space of nearly 40,000 bacterial chitinases, integrating phylogenetics with a quantitative analysis of domain promiscuity to decode their evolutionary history. We reveal that diversification follows distinct trajectories: enzymes necessary for environmental chitin scavenging evolve via high modular plasticity and structural elaboration of the catalytic core, whereas sequences required for specialized, essential developmental roles fix their domain architecture to fulfill lineage-specific physiological roles. By resolving how domain accretion co-evolves with catalytic scaffolds, this work provides a framework for understanding how multi-domain enzymes adapt to complex environments.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Adaptive evolution enables species to survive and thrive under changing environmental conditions. In the face of accelerating global climate change, thermal stress represents a major challenge to the persistence of terrestrial ectotherms. Understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying thermal adaptation is therefore critical for predicting species evolutionary potential and future success. Here, we combine experimental evolution, phenotypic assays, and multi-omics analyses to investigate the adaptive responses of the diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella), a globally destructive pest of cruciferous crops, to contrasting thermal environments. Populations evolved under hot (32{degrees}C/27{degrees}C) and cold (15{degrees}C/10{degrees}C) regimes exhibited distinct demographic and fitness traits relative to those maintained under favorable conditions (26{degrees}C). Integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed extensive transcriptional reprogramming and metabolic adjustments associated with temperature adaptation. Key pathways involved in lipid metabolism and DNA methylation were enriched, while functional validation using CRISPR-Cas9 confirmed that a mutant allele of PxSODC enhances superoxide dismutase activity and improves tolerance to thermal extremes. Together, these findings provides critical insights into this arthropod&#x27;s capacity for global dispersal and likely persistence under climate change, establishing a framework for understanding equivalent effects in other species.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Microexons are extremely short exons that are highly conserved in vertebrates and are essential for normal brain development. Their small size poses a challenge for canonical exon-definition splice site recognition, which typically relies on spliceosomal interactions across standard length exons. Here, we determine the sequence and RNA structural features of neural microexons in humans in comparison with chickens. We find that both human and chicken neural microexons share intronic features that extend the functional distance between the branchpoint and the 3&#x27; splice site, including distal positioning and lengthening of polypyrimidine tracts. Using experimental RNA structure-probing on a subset of neural microexons, we show that the human branchpoint-to-splice site region is unusually accessible and relatively unpaired compared to other exon classes. However, we find little support for shared RNA secondary structures between orthologous human and chicken precursor RNAs despite high sequence conservation. Using the chick embryo as a developmental model, we demonstrate that a subset of neural microexons undergo dynamic, stage-specific regulation during brain development that correlates with expression of known microexon regulators, SRRM4 and NOVA1. Our data suggest that neural microexon splicing fluctuates during brain development and may rely on an extended polypyrimidine tract and structural accessibility for splicing efficiency, rather than conserved secondary structures.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) provides valuable insights into human evolution, population diversity, and disease etiology. Here, we present the mtDNA-network (https://apps.lghm.ufpa.br/mtdna/), an integrative bioinformatics database and tool for the visualization and analysis of mitochondrial variants (single-nucleotide variants and insertions/deletions). The mtDNA-network was upgraded to enable investigation of mtDNA in admixed Brazilian individuals with substantial contributions from uniparental Indigenous and African ancestries. We implement a bioinformatics pipeline to harmonize variant calling across 339 mtDNA samples. The dataset supports general genetic population analysis and variant mapping for complex diseases, including Parkinson&#x27;s disease (104 cases and 75 controls), leprosy (33 cases and 37 controls), and somatic gastric cancer (40 cases and 50 controls). The mtDNA-network tool features an intuitive interface and analytical dashboards for transitions, transversions, heteroplasmy, and variant-disease networks, and serves as a strategic resource for advancing research in population genetics and precision medicine in underrepresented populations. We reinforce the critical need to expand non-European genomic representation in global databases to promote more equitable genomic diversity studies and clinically relevant discoveries.</p>

The early diverged strains are characterized by slower insect killing, extensive pre-mortem fungal proliferation within hosts, and prolific sporulation, whereas recently diverged strains show rapid growth, a &quot;kill and consume&quot; strategy linked to destruxin toxin production, and enhanced plant root colonization. Metabolic assays demonstrated that recently diverged strains utilize a broader range of carbon sources, supporting their ecological versatility as pathogens, endophytes, and saprophytes. Germination rates on insect cuticles and plant roots strongly correlate with each other, and with virulence to Drosophila and beetles (Tenebrio molitor, Popillia japonica), highlighting nutritional flexibility as a key driver of ecological adaptation. Immune response assays in Drosophila revealed that virulence differences among strains are also partly mediated by host immune activation. These findings suggest that nutritional mode shifts underpin the evolutionary trajectory from specialist insect pathogen to plant associations and enhanced insect virulence within M. robertsii, providing a valuable model for studying fungal ecological plasticity and informing the development of fungal biofertilizers and biopesticides.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Directed evolution of an RNA ligase unexpectedly yields multiple distinct ligase/branching ribozyme chemistries (including a single-mutation reactivity switch), reinforcing the catalytic versatility and evolvability expected in RNA World–style origins-of-life scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> RNA-catalyzed assembly of RNA strands was one of the most essential enzymatic functions in a primordial RNA-based biology. To explore the scope of RNA-catalyzed RNA assembly, we used directed evolution to re-engineer a ligase ribozyme that originally used 5&#x27;-phosphorimidazolide RNA substrates into a ribozyme that ligates RNA substrates carrying the biologically relevant 5&#x27;-triphosphate group. Unexpectedly, analysis of the low-abundance regime of the selected RNA population, representing ~0.1% of the population, revealed four distinct types of ligase ribozymes, indicating that multiple ribozymes had emerged from a single experiment, despite the stringent selection for the desired &#x27;triphosphate ligase&#x27;. The first ligase type exhibits strict specificity for 5&#x27;-phosphorimidazolide substrates, even though these substrates were never presented during selection. The second and third ligase types catalyze two different branching reactions, each involving the 5&#x27;-triphosphate groups on the ribozyme and a different internal hydroxyl group on the substrate. These reactions resemble &#x27;branching&#x27; reactions catalyzed by naturally occurring ribozymes, including the spliceosome, even though these ribozymes emerged from a synthetic RNA library with no relation to biological RNA catalysts. The fourth ligase type mediates a reaction between its 5&#x27;-triphosphate and the substrate&#x27;s terminal 2&#x27;-OH, but only when the substrate carries a 3&#x27;-phosphate. Remarkably, a single point mutation toggles this ribozyme between linear ligation and branching, functioning as a unique reactivity switch. Such a switch provides a mechanism for RNA catalysts to acquire new reactivities with minimal mutational perturbation, and therefore, has interesting evolutionary implications for primordial biocatalysis. More generally, the emergence of such catalytic diversity from a single evolution experiment under highly constrained selection pressures highlights the catalytic flexibility and evolutionary potential of RNA. These findings strengthen the plausibility that an RNA World could have supported a wide range of chemistries essential for the emergence of life.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Reciprocal climate experiments in wild and domesticated apple seedlings show mostly conserved phenotypic/transcriptional plasticity with limited population-specific regulatory divergence shaped by evolutionary history and domestication.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> - Perennial crops can respond to climate change through phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation, yet how these processes interact and are shaped by domestication and population history remains poorly understood in long-lived species. - We combined controlled reciprocal climate experiments with phenotypic, transcriptomic, and genomic analyses in cultivated apple (Malus domestica) and its wild relatives. We grew 1,248 seedlings from four wild apple populations under four simulated European climates alongside M. domestica. Early survival and twelve phenotypic traits were quantified, and gene expression was analyzed in 96 individuals using RNA sequencing, together with DNA sequencing from a previous study. - Early seedling survival revealed strong population-specific responses to climate. Phenotypic and transcriptional responses to climate were widespread and largely conserved, with a core set of climate-responsive genes enriched for stress- and nutrient-related functions and evolving under strong purifying selection. Population-specific regulatory responses were limited and largely reflected genetic divergence. Domestication was associated with altered expression patterns and reduced deleterious mutation load. - These results show that climate responses in apple seedlings reflect a balance between conserved plastic responses and population-specific genetic constraints shaped by evolutionary history and domestication, with implications for predicting climate resilience in perennial crops.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Computational structural and phylogenetic analysis of H5N1 neuraminidase (NA1) identifies a key residue (K207) controlling dynamic switching and suggests how single-point mutations can rewire allostery and selection across hosts, but it has only tangential relevance to Origins-of-Life questions beyond general evolutionary dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> by Muyiwa S. Adegbaju, Oluwabuyikunmi Owo-Odusi, Eden T. Wirtz, Olanrewaju B. Morenikeji, Olusola Ojurongbe, Bolaji N. Thomas The concern regarding H5N1 outbreak, particularly the accelerated mutagenesis of its core genomic elements, underscores the persistent threat of influenza to global health. Neuraminidase (NA), a pivotal sialidase integral to virion egress and propagation, comprises nine distinct isoforms, exhibiting unique evolutionary trajectories and structural adaptations. Despite extensive characterization of hemagglutinin subtypes, the functional divergence of the nine NA subtypes remains inadequately understood. To address this gap, we conducted a structural analysis of NA subtypes, employing structural superimposition and motif-guided sequence alignment to delineate subtype-specific residues. Hierarchical clustering stratified the nine NA subtypes into four distinct subgroups: NA2 (subgroup I), NA1 and NA4 (subgroup II), NA9/NA7/NA6/NA3 (subgroup III), and NA8/NA5 (subgroup 4). We identified 40 highly conserved and functionally significant amino acid loci, likely modulating enzymatic activity and substrate specificity across subtypes. To investigate the structural basis of adaptation in H5N1, we generated NA1 mutants by swapping family specific position (FSP) residues and analyzed their dynamics using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, complemented by a deep phylogenetic analysis across six host reservoirs. MD simulation parameters reveal a dynamic paradox: the Wild-Type (WT) NA1 maintains a conserved global compactness Rg, which masks a complex, bi-modal switching mechanism essential for its catalytic function, validated by multi-basin free energy landscape (FEL) topography. We identify Lysine-207 (K207) as the master determinant of this switching mechanism and the enzyme’s dynamic fate. Substitutions at this conserved nexus produced diametrically opposite outcomes: K207W imposed structural rigidification (abolishing the switch), K207H achieved dynamic preservation, and K207I drove expanded disorder and collapse. Furthermore, dynamic correlation analysis shows that these single-point substitutions function as molecular switches that significantly re-wire the enzyme’s allosteric communication networks, extending far beyond the active site. To assess the role of NA1 in host tropism and adaptive evolution, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of NA1 genes from H5N1 isolates across multiple host reservoirs; H. sapiens , G. gallus , Anser anser domesticus , M. gallopavo , B. taurus , and C. olor . Notably, we observed opposing selection pressures and diversification patterns: G. gallus isolates showed signatures of positive selection consistent with hyper-reassortment, while human isolates displayed highly diverse, sporadic spillover events. We conclude that the evolutionary contribution of NA1 to H5N1 host adaptation is not encoded in static structure, but certain residues such as K207 defines a pivotal mechanism for regulating the enzyme’s function through dynamic states. Our MD data thus proposes a novel strategy for next-generation antivirals by targeting this dynamic vulnerability—the Nexus for Dynamic Ablation—to permanently entrain the enzyme in a non-functional conformation.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This preprint characterizes a novel Cas12a subtype (BaCas12a3) whose RNA-triggered collateral activity selectively cleaves tRNA termini to induce growth arrest, expanding known CRISPR effector mechanisms and informing broader nucleic-acid biology relevant to early evolution studies.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The CRISPR-Cas12 family encompasses diverse RNA-guided nucleases with both DNA-targeting and RNA-targeting subtypes. They can trigger antiviral activities mainly through either direct elimination invading nucleic acids, or activating broad collateral cleavage to induce abortive infection. Here, we report a novel type V CRISPR effector BaCas12a3 that causes growth inhibition through a unique tRNA-cleavage mechanism. Plasmid interference assays indicated that BaCas12a3 inhibits host growth arrest without invoking the DNA damage response, suggesting that the immune responses may not involve double strand breaks of DNA. Indeed, biochemical characterization of the BaCas12a3-crRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) unraveled that the effector is an RNA-activating nuclease that cleaves 3&#x27; terminus of tRNAs. Cryo-EM structures of BaCas12a3 reveal a conserved bilobed architecture featuring a unique nucleic acid-loading (NL) domain adjacent to the RuvC catalytic center. Structural and mutagenesis analyses show that the NL domain, together with a zinc ribbon domain, form a gated substrate groove. Target RNA binding induces conformational changes that open this groove and expose the RuvC active site, enabling specific tRNA cleavage while preventing other non-specific degradation. Our findings identified the NL domain aside the RuvC active site responsible for the tRNA recognition in BaCas12a3, expanding the functional diversity of CRISPR immunity.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Living with COVID-19 requires continued vigilance against the spread and emergence of variants of concern (VOCs). Rapid and accurate saliva diagnostic testing, alongside basic public health responses, is a viable option contributing to effective transmission control. Nevertheless, our knowledge regarding the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection in saliva is not as advanced as our understanding of the respiratory tract. Here, we analyzed longitudinal viral load data of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva samples from 144 patients with mild COVID-19 (a combination of our collected data and published data). Using a mathematical model, we quantified individual-level viral dynamics and stratified them into three groups using a clustering approach. Notably, the three groups exhibited distinct differences in viral RNA detection durations: 11.5 days (95% CI: 10.6–12.4), 17.4 days (16.6–18.2), and 30.0 days (28.1–31.8), respectively. Surprisingly, this stratified grouping remained unexplained despite our analysis of 47 types of clinical data, including basic demographic information, clinical symptoms, results of blood tests, and vital signs. Additionally, we quantified the expression levels of 92 micro-RNAs in a subset of saliva samples, but these also failed to explain the observed stratification, although the mir-1846 level may have been weakly correlated with peak viral load. Our study provides insights into SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in saliva, highlighting the challenges in predicting the duration of viral RNA detection without indicators that directly reflect an individual’s immune response, such as antibody induction. Given the significant individual heterogeneity in the kinetics of saliva viral shedding, identifying biomarker(s) for viral shedding patterns will be crucial for improving public health interventions in the era of living with COVID-19.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are commonly removed from wastewater matrices using ion-exchange resins (IXRs). This practice generates PFAS-laden solid waste, requiring disposal of spent sorbent and introducing long-term liability. We demonstrate a closed-loop strategy for treating spent macroporous and gel-type sorbents that integrates supercritical CO2 (scCO2)-enabled regeneration with end-of-life regenerant treatment. The scCO2-amended with ethanol and HCl achieves rapid and near-complete regeneration of PFOA-loaded resins, RE% = 99.7 ± 0.1% at T = 75°C and a 60 min contact time, without compromising their structure or surface functional groups, thus enabling repeated adsorption-regeneration cycles. The PFAS-rich regenerant is then fully mineralized in a continuous-flow supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) system, where the regenerant&#x27;s chemical energy enables the reactor&#x27;s autogenic operation, eliminating secondary waste streams. Integrating rapid PFAS extraction and downstream PFAS destruction enables the reuse of IXR sorbents and reduces treatment costs, material consumption, and long-term environmental liability in PFAS remediation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A novel sol–gel-based Excess CO₂ Acidification (ECA) method was proposed to synthesize uniform metal oxide nanoparticles with consistent size, morphology, and mesoporosity. In this method, CO₂ was over-sparged into a buffered KOH solution to generate an acidic bicarbonate buffer, followed by addition of metal precursor solutions and controlled reduction of CO₂ concentration established a proton concentration gradient. This approach ensures homogeneous sol–gel reactions, prevents localized pH spikes, and minimizes thermal-induced structural changes. The synthesized nanoparticles exhibited consistent particle size distribution and enhanced mesoporosity. Compared to conventional pouring or titration sol-gel methods, ECA reduces reaction time, reactor volume, water footprint, and energy consumption, while improving particle harvest efficiency. The method is versatile and can be applied to the synthesis of various metal oxide nanoparticles, optimization of magnetic and catalytic properties, Sequential solvent exchange, and potential reuse of residual KOH solutions for microbial or colloidal applications. In summary, the ECA technique provides a scalable, efficient, and sustainable strategy for producing high-quality mesoporous metal oxides suitable for industrial applications.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Asymmetry is a fundamental property in the molecular organization of life, but how it emerges and propagates remains elusive. One-dimensional assemblies formed through reversible, non-covalent interactions can adopt helical confor-mations and reorganize slowly, making them powerful model systems for studying the emergence and persistence of asym-metry in aqueous environments. Recent studies have shown that chiral surfactants can transfer their stereogenic information inducing a helical bias in supramolecular polymers. Here, using light as a non-invasive trigger, we demonstrate how two phe-nomena with different kinetics coalesce to establish a profound amplification of asymmetry in co-assemblies of racemic su-pramolecular polymers and chiral surfactants. Upon irradiation, the photoresponsive merocyanine surfactant undergoes quick isomerization into its more hydrophobic spiropyran form, enhancing its interaction with the racemic polymer and in-ducing an effective helical bias that develops and persists on timescales that far exceed the lifetime of the molecular trigger. This light-driven asymmetry is fully reversible and involves metastable structures which can be further promoted by brief, well-timed light pulses. Our findings demonstrate that limited administrations of light can induce and sustain asymmetric states in water-compatible supramolecular polymers, opening avenues for dynamic supramolecular materials with non-equi-librium features toward life-like adaptive systems. It shows a unique emergence of supramolecular chirality in time and space.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Advancements in ancient DNA (aDNA) research have enabled the recovery of individual human genomes through target enrichment approaches. Despite the decreasing cost of next-generation sequencing, enrichment methods targeting single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compiled in RNA/DNA hybrid panels remain costly and require further authentic optimisations. Here, we present the Tweap (Twist cheap) protocol as a cost-effective alternative to the commercialised Twist protocol for target enrichment via in-solution hybridisation of ancient human DNA by replacing the streptavidin-coated superparamagnetic beads for binding the hybridised targeted DNA. We evaluated the protocol on 14 double-stranded DNA libraries from ancient human individuals originating from a hot and humid climate zone known to accelerate DNA degradation. The selected individuals reflected similar preservation levels and a broad range of endogenous human DNA content (0.79-41.69%). We optimised and simplified both the Twist and Tweap protocols for target enrichment, particularly for libraries with ultra-low library complexity, making it reproducible in any life sciences laboratory. The modified Tweap protocol not only reduced overall reagent costs and consumption, contributing to more climate-conscious research, but also recovered up to 7% more unique SNPs when applying multi-pooling of libraries from the same individual. Our findings demonstrate that the Tweap protocol is a viable, efficient, and scalable alternative for SNP capture in ancient DNA (aDNA) studies, supporting broader accessibility and sustainability in ancient DNA research.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The global pollution by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) requires solid advances in technology development and mechanistic understanding for PFAS degradation. The UV/sulfite method that produces hydrated electron (eaq−) has demonstrated excellent performance, but the mechanisms remained largely elusive. Although an eaq− is required to initiate the degradation, the reductive hydrodefluorination (C–F→C–H) is merely a minor pathway. Some extensively observed phenomena, such as chain-shortening of RF–CF2–COO– into RF–COO– (RF=CnF2n+1), “incidental” detections of very-short-chain RF–COO– products, and the substantially enhanced performance at high pH, had not received convincing explanations. This study provides a comprehensive understanding via systematic analyses of transformation products (TPs) across three legacy PFAS families: RF–CH2CH2–COO– (FTCA), RF–SO3– (PFSA), and RF–COO– (PFCA) of various RF chain lengths. TPs from FTCAs evidence hydroxyl radical (HO•) from water photolysis. After the first C–F bond cleavage by eaq−, the fluorocarbon undergoes hydrogenation, sulfonation, hydroxylation (followed by C–C bond cleavage), or unsaturated bond formation by reacting with H+ (and another eaq−), SO3−•, HO•, or HO–, respectively. The TPs provide strong experimental evidence for the electron-transfer-limiting theory. More importantly, results demonstrate the critical role of C–C bond cleavage to generate new –COO– groups in TPs and elucidate the preference for alkaline pH toward deep defluorination. The “decarboxylation” for PFCA chain-shortening produces HCOO– rather than CO2 or CO postulated in recent literature. This work significantly updates fundamental chemical insights for (i) tackling PFAS pollution and (ii) designing readily degradable fluorochemicals.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nucleic acids are central to many bio-molecular processes central to cellular life, yet characterising their molecular motions and fluctuations with atomic resolution can be challenging. To tackle this, we introduce high resolution relaxometry, combined with high field nuclear spin relaxation as a powerful tool to probe the motions. With this approach we identify motions occurring both on the picosecond and low nanosecond time-scales. By integrating these results with molecular dynamics simulations and ensembles, obtained from residual dipolar coupling (RDC) measurements, we can identify which timescales helical motions and sugar puckering dynamics occur on. The approach outlined in this study provides a framework for interrogating molecular dynamics in nucleic acids and benchmarking approaches, such as molecular dynamics simulations, that aim to characterise dynamic processes.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Develops more stable, high-current organic bulk-heterojunction photoanodes and tandem devices for solar-driven water oxidation/unassisted water splitting, improving operational stability and solar-to-hydrogen efficiency but only indirectly informing Origins-of-Life questions via energy/water context.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Monolithic photoelectrodes are a promising way to exploit the excellent optoelectronic properties of organic polymer:non-fullerene bulk-heterojunctions (BHJ) for photoelectrochemical applications. However, the high voltage losses, poor photochemical stability and high synthetic complexity of the most commonly used polymer:non-fullerene combinations have limited their full potential. Here, we address these limitations by introducing a BHJ comprising the low-synthetic-complexity polymer PTQ10 and the near-infrared absorbing acceptor L8-BO. By integrating this new BHJ with a graphite sheet functionalised with a NiFeOOH catalyst, we achieve a low onset potential of +0.64 VRHE, a photocurrent density of 21 mA cm−2 at +1.23 VRHE and a t80 operational stability of 22 h under full AM1.5G illumination in monolithic photoanodes for water oxidation. These values represent a 40 mV increase in photovoltage and a sevenfold improvement in operational stability (t80 extended from 3 h to 22 h) compared to the reference system based on the ternary D18:PM6:L8-BO photoactive blend. Spectroscopic analyses reveal that these improvements stem from the reduced non-radiative voltage losses (from 0.24 V to 0.19 V) and superior photochemical and morphological stability of the PTQ10:L8-BO blend compared to the reference blend. Building on these advances, we demonstrate monolithic tandem photoanodes based on PTQ10:IDIC and PTQ10:L8-BO organic blends, achieving a solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 6.2%. This work offers critical insights for developing stable, high-efficiency organic photoelectrodes for unassisted solar hydrogen generation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Biology uses folded polymeric chains to perform complex tasks, from scaffolding catalytic enzymes to creating highly selective transmembrane channels. Aquaporins are a class of transmembrane channels that can strictly exclude the transport of salts, whilst allowing exceptional rates of water transport (up to 3 x 10^9 water molecules per channel per second).

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Controlling multi-ligand assembly on nanoparticles (NPs) is critical for developing advanced nanomaterials for sensing, diagnostics, and therapy. Despite the importance of designing nanomaterials with tailored interfaces, it remains poorly understood how the physical and chemical driving forces will influence monolayer morphology for a variety of chemically functional ligand mixtures. To address this issue, we examine a series of binary monolayers composed of linear alkanethiols and mercaptocarboxylic acids, with two different end-group chemistries (--CH3, --COOH), across a range of physical hydrocarbon chain length differences. We extend a unified framework we have previously developed to quantify the monolayer structure by comparing matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) experiments with configurationally biased Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations to probe and predict the self-assembly of these two-ligand mixtures on the surface of ultrasmall gold NPs. Our results reveal that monolayer morphology is significantly impacted by the chain length difference between the chemically distinct alkanethiol and mercaptocarboxylic acid ligands, transitioning from randomly mixed to phase-separated Janus-like domains as the hydrocarbon chain length difference increases. Our findings highlight the importance of length differences in determining monolayer structure, even for ligand mixtures containing alkyl and carboxylic acid end groups, offering strategies for tuning nanoscale surface properties for applications that would utilize the chemical functionality of the carboxylic acid moiety.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Lithium metal chloride halospinels of the general formula Li2MCl4 are a promising class of earth-abundant ion conductors for all-solid-state batteries. However, poor room-temperature ionic conductivity has historically limited their use in practical applications. Here, we substitute Zr4+ into Li2ZnCl4 along the series Li2−2x/3Zn1−xZr2x/3Cl4 (x = 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9, and 1.0) to understand how cation disorder and vacancy tuning impacts ion transport in “normal” halospinels. Aliovalent Zr4+ substitution increases ionic conductivity by nearly five orders of magnitude, from 1.320(3) × 10−9 S cm−1 in Li2ZnCl4 to 6.74(1) × 10−5 S cm−1 for x = 0.6. Average and local structure characterization through synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) and neutron pair distribution function (nPDF) analysis reveal that Zr4+ redistributes the Zn2+ and Li+ sublattices into previously unoccupied interstitial sites that form new low-energy hopping pathways that facilitate ion transport. We rationalize the dramatic rearrangement of the cation local structure by considering the coordination preferences of the cations and the potential electrostatic penalties incurred by the higher-valent Zr4+ cations. This work delivers an atomistic understanding of substitution-induced cation disorder and ion transport properties in a new family of earth-abundant halospinels.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a generalizable, validated atomistic force-field pipeline (NucleoPhi) for simulating chemically modified nucleic acids—including 2′-fluoro/2′-O-methyl/2′FANA sugars and pseudouridine—supporting predictive modeling of alternative genetic polymers relevant to early-life and XNA-style scenarios.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Accurate and transferable force fields are essential for reliably simulating both natural and chemically modified nucleic acids at atomistic resolution. However, there is no unified framework to consistently parameterize force fields across the wide range of sugar, base, and backbone or linker modifications commonly used in therapeutic oligonucleotides. Building on a generalized protocol, we develop force field parameters for the 2&#x27;-fluoro, 2&#x27;-O-methyl, and 2&#x27;FANA ribose modifications, as well as the pseudo-uridine nucleobase modification. These models were validated against a diverse set of experimentally determined structures and show good agreement with the observed conformational ensembles. We further demonstrate their utility in elucidating how chemical modifications modulate local structure, flexibility, and interaction energetics in nucleic acid hybrid duplexes, siRNA–Ago2 complexes, and the evasion of MC1 ribonuclease by pseudo-uridine. Overall, this work establishes a robust, generalizable pipeline for developing force fields for modified nucleic acids, enabling predictive atomistic simulations reliably.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) play central roles in gene regulation by recognizing specific DNA sequences, yet their function in synthetic molecular systems is typically limited to transcriptional control or sequence-specific binding. Here we describe a proximity-driven molecular framework that couples DBP–DNA recognition to DNA strand displacement reactions, enabling DNA-binding proteins to act as sequence-selective inputs for synthetic nucleic acid reaction pathways without modification of the protein scaffold. In our design, protein binding induces spatial colocalization of DNA components, triggering conditional generation of functional nucleic acid outputs through proximity-mediated strand displacement. Using representative DBPs, including EGR1, YY1, and p53, we connect protein recognition to DNA strand displacement, activation of a fluorogenic RNA aptamer, regulation of CRISPR–Cas12a and Cas13 activity, and coordination of multistep CRISPR cascades. A defining feature of this strategy is the decoupling of molecular recognition from downstream function, which avoids structural and thermodynamic constraints associated with switch-based designs. These results demonstrate a general proximity-based approach for integrating DNA-binding proteins into programmable molecular architectures.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> N2O emissions-reducing technologies are essential to reduce wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this study, we perform a life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA) of a technology that intentionally produces N2O from WWTP N and uses this gas as an oxidant in the production of phenol and co-product N2. We compare the cost and sustainability of producing phenol and N2 with this technology and via conventional routes (cumene-to-phenol, cryogenic distillation, and pressure swing absorption to N2). Depending on the co-product allocation method, the median cumulative energy demand of the phenol produced from WWTP nitrogen is 30% to 50% higher than phenol from the cumene process, while the global warming potential of phenol produced via this pathway ranges from 10% lower to 40% higher than conventional routes to this chemical. However, depending on WWTP size, level of N2O recovery, and the market price of feedstocks and products, producing phenol at WWTP with this technology can produce a positive internal rate of return. We conclude that this technology could be applicable for large-scale WWTPs, but technological advancements are needed.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein nanopores have revolutionized DNA sequencing by enabling long-read, real-time, and portable genomic analysis. This review traces the experimental evolution of three key protein nanopores—α-hemolysin, MspA, and CsgG—highlighting how iterative engineering overcame challenges such as translocation control and homopolymer resolution. Concurrently, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have elucidated DNA–pore interactions, ion current modulation, free-energy landscapes, and so forth, providing mechanistic insights and guiding rational design. However, MD studies consistently lag behind experimental and industrial advances, resulting in a reactive “simulate-after-validate” paradigm. We identify critical gaps in simulating motor–pore complexes, experimental timescales, and emerging designs like dual-constriction pores. To bridge these, we propose leveraging deep learning-based structure prediction, de novo protein design, and advanced multiscale simulations to foster proactive, integrated development of next-generation nanopore technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10032v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The presence of correlated noise, arising from a mixture of independent fluctuations and a common noisy input shared across the neural population, is a ubiquitous feature of neural circuits, yet its impact on collective network dynamics remains poorly understood. We analyze a network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons driven by Gaussian noise with a tunable degree of correlation. Using the cumulant expansion method, we derive a reduced set of effective mean-field equations that accurately describe the evolution of the population&#x27;s mean firing rate and membrane potential. Our analysis reveals a counterintuitive phenomenon: increasing the noise correlation strength suppresses the mean network activity, an effect we term correlated-noise-inhibited spiking. Furthermore, within a specific parameter regime, the network exhibits metastability, manifesting itself as spontaneous, noise-driven transitions between distinct high- and low-activity states. These results provide a theoretical framework for reducing the dynamics of complex stochastic networks and demonstrate how correlated noise can fundamentally regulate macroscopic neural activity, with implications for understanding state transitions in biological systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10486v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We introduce and study finite lattice kinetic equations for bosons, fermions, and discrete NLS. For each model this closed evolution equation provides an approximate description for the evolution of the appropriate covariance function in the system. It is obtained by truncating the cumulant hierarchy and dropping the higher order cumulants in the usual manner. To have such a reference solution should simplify controlling the full hierarchy and thus allow estimating the error from the truncation. The harmonic part is given by nearest neighbour hopping, with arbitrary symmetric interaction potential of coupling strength $\lambda&gt;0$. We consider the well-posedness of the resulting evolution equation up to finite kinetic times on a finite but large enough lattice. We obtain decay of the solutions and upper bounds that are independent of $\lambda$ and depend on the lattice size only via some Sobolev type norms of the interaction potential and initial data. We prove that the solutions are not sensitive to how the energy conservation delta function is approximated.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Uses statistical-physics models on planar graphs to derive topological conditions for long-range order/self-organisation under local interactions, offering broad (but indirect) conceptual relevance to how prebiotic or early biological systems might sustain organized states.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2501.13188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: All intelligence is collective intelligence, in the sense that it is made of parts which must align with respect to system-level goals. Understanding the dynamics which facilitate or limit navigation of problem spaces by aligned parts thus impacts many fields ranging across life sciences and engineering. To that end, consider a system on the vertices of a planar graph, with pairwise interactions prescribed by the edges of the graph. Such systems can sometimes exhibit long-range order, distinguishing one phase of macroscopic behaviour from another. In networks of interacting systems we may view spontaneous ordering as a form of self-organisation, modelling neural and basal forms of cognition. Here, we discuss necessary conditions on the topology of the graph for an ordered phase to exist, with an eye towards finding constraints on the ability of a system with local interactions to maintain an ordered target state. By studying the scaling of free energy under the formation of domain walls in three model systems -- the Potts model, autoregressive models, and hierarchical networks -- we show how the combinatorics of interactions on a graph prevent or allow spontaneous ordering. As an application we are able to analyse why multiscale systems like those prevalent in biology are capable of organising into complex patterns, whereas rudimentary language models are challenged by long sequences of outputs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10540v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Burst errors involving simultaneous insertions, deletions, and substitutions occur in practical scenarios, including DNA data storage and document synchronization, motivating developments of channel codes that can correct such errors. In this paper, we address the problem of constructing error-correcting codes (ECCs) capable of handling multiple bursts of $t_1$-deletion-$t_2$-insertion ($(t_1,t_2)$-DI) errors, where each burst consists of $t_1$ deletions followed by $t_2$ insertions in a binary sequence. We make three key contributions: Firstly, we establish the fundamental equivalence of (1) two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs, (2) two bursts of $(t_2,t_1)$-DI ECCs, and (3) one burst each of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI and $(t_2,t_1)$-DI ECCs. Then, we derive lower and upper bounds on the code size of two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs, which can naturally be extended to the case of multiple bursts. Finally, we present constructions of two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs. Compared to the codes obtained by the syndrome compression technique, the resulting codes achieve significantly lower computational complexity.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10256v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We introduce the sum channel, a new channel model motivated by applications in distributed storage and DNA data storage. In the error-free case, it takes as input an $\ell$-row binary matrix and outputs an $(\ell+1)$-row matrix whose first $\ell$ rows equal the input and whose last row is their parity (sum) row. We construct a two-deletion-correcting code with redundancy $2\lceil\log_2\log_2 n\rceil + O(\ell^2)$ for $\ell$-row inputs. When $\ell=2$, we establish an upper bound of $\lceil\log_2\log_2 n\rceil + O(1)$, implying that our redundancy is optimal up to a factor of 2. We also present a code correcting a single substitution with $\lceil \log_2(\ell+1)\rceil$ redundant bits and prove that it is within one bit of optimality.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10263v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In the field of artificial intelligence, real parameter single objective optimization is an important direction. Both the Differential Evolution (DE) and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) demonstrate good performance for real parameter single objective optimization. Nevertheless, there exist other types of evolutionary algorithm for the purpose. In recent years, researchers begin to study long-term search. EA4eig - an ensemble of three DE variants and CMA-ES - performs well for long-term search. In this paper, we introduce two types of evolutionary algorithm proposed recently - crisscross search and sparrow search - into EA4eig as secondary evolutionary algorithms to process inferior individuals. Thus, EA4eigCS is obtained. In our ensemble, the secondary evolutionary algorithms are expected to vary distribution of the population for breaking stagnation. Experimental results show that our EA4eigCS outperforms EA4eig and is competitive when compared with state-of-the-art algorithms.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10329v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We investigate the capacity of noisy frequency-based channels, motivated by DNA data storage in the short-molecule regime, where information is encoded in the frequency of items types rather than their order. The channel output is a histogram formed by random sampling of items, followed by noisy item identification. While the capacity of the noiseless frequency-based channel has been previously addressed, the effect of identification noise has not been fully characterized. We present a converse bound on the channel capacity that follows from stochastic degradation and the data processing inequality. We then establish an achievable bound, which is based on a Poissonization of the multinomial sampling process, and an analysis of the resulting vector Poisson channel with inter-symbol interference. This analysis refines concentration inequalities for the information density used in Feinstein bound, and explicitly characterizes an additive loss in the mutual information due to identification noise. We apply our results to a DNA storage channel in the short-molecule regime, and quantify the resulting loss in the scaling of the total number of reliably stored bits.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2504.20891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Quantum systems that interact non-locally with an environment are paradigms for exploring collective phenomena. They naturally emerge in various physical contexts involving long-range, many-body interactions. We consider a general class of such open systems characterized by a coupling to the environment which is inversely proportional to the square root of the environment size. We show that the induced system dynamics has a universal bosonic nature: the same evolution arises from coupling the system to a collection of noninteracting bosonic modes, independently of the microscopic structure of the original environment. This emergent &quot;bosonization&quot; of the environment&#x27;s influence results from the scaling of the coupling in the thermodynamic limit and is a manifestation of the quantum central limit theorem. While the effect has been observed in specific models before, we show that it is, in fact, a universal feature.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10657v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful operators for evolutionary search, yet the design of efficient search scaffolds remains ad hoc. While promising, current LLM-in-the-loop systems lack a systematic approach to managing the evolutionary process. We identify three distinct failure modes: Context Pollution, where experiment history biases future candidate generation; Mode Collapse, where agents stagnate in local minima due to poor exploration-exploitation balance; and Weak Collaboration, where rigid crossover strategies fail to leverage parallel search trajectories effectively. We introduce Progress-Aware Consistent Evolution (PACEvolve), a framework designed to robustly govern the agent&#x27;s context and search dynamics, to address these challenges. PACEvolve combines hierarchical context management (HCM) with pruning to address context pollution; momentum-based backtracking (MBB) to escape local minima; and a self-adaptive sampling policy that unifies backtracking and crossover for dynamic search coordination (CE), allowing agents to balance internal refinement with cross-trajectory collaboration. We demonstrate that PACEvolve provides a systematic path to consistent, long-horizon self-improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results on LLM-SR and KernelBench, while discovering solutions surpassing the record on Modded NanoGPT.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Numerous applications in research and medicine rely on reliable identification and quantification of virus-infected cells. Current methods either apply reporter viruses, that often differ from clinical isolates (e. g. cell tropism, immune evasion) or staining approaches, that prevent live-cell experiments and may introduce biases through manual counting. We present a deep learning model for the label-free identification of virus-infected cells on light microscopy images (VAIruScope). To overcome limitations, our pipeline enables an automated quantification of virus-infected cells based on the recognition of cytopathic effects. The method was applied to different cell models and four clinically relevant prototype viruses representing RNA- (influenza A virus), DNA- (human cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus-1) and retroviruses (human immunodeficiency virus-1). VAIruScope identified infected cells achieving classification accuracies of up to 96 %. As proof-of-concept, the method was validated using electron microscopy for a wild-type HSV-1. VAIruScope may be applicable to live-cell imaging to investigate infection dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2507.09614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Symmetries are a key tool in understanding quantum systems, and, among many other things, can be exploited to increase the efficiency of numerical simulations of quantum dynamics. Disordered systems usually feature reduced symmetries and additionally require averaging over many realizations, making their numerical study computationally demanding. However, when studying quantities linear in the time-evolved state, i.e. expectation values of observables, one can apply the averaging procedure to the time evolution operator, resulting in an effective dynamical map, which restores symmetry at the level of superoperators. In this work, we develop schemes for efficiently constructing symmetric sectors of the disorder-averaged dynamical map using short-time and weak-disorder expansions. To benchmark the method, we apply it to an Ising model with random all-to-all interactions in the presence of a transverse field. After disorder averaging, this system becomes effectively permutation-invariant, and thus the size of the symmetric subspace scales polynomially in the number of spins allowing for the simulation of large systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10110v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This study proposes MCEMOL (Multi-Constrained Evolutionary Molecular Design Framework), a molecular optimization approach integrating rule-based evolution with molecular crossover. MCEMOL employs dual-layer evolution: optimizing transformation rules at rule level while applying crossover and mutation to molecular structures. Unlike deep learning methods requiring large datasets and extensive training, our algorithm evolves efficiently from minimal starting molecules with low computational overhead. The framework incorporates message-passing neural networks and comprehensive chemical constraints, ensuring efficient and interpretable molecular design. Experimental results demonstrate that MCEMOL provides transparent design pathways through its evolutionary mechanism while generating valid, diverse, target-compliant molecules. The framework achieves 100% molecular validity with high structural diversity and excellent drug-likeness compliance, showing strong performance in symmetry constraints, pharmacophore optimization, and stereochemical integrity. Unlike black-box methods, MCEMOL delivers dual value: interpretable transformation rules researchers can understand and trust, alongside high-quality molecular libraries for practical applications. This establishes a paradigm where interpretable AI-driven drug design and effective molecular generation are achieved simultaneously, bridging the gap between computational innovation and practical drug discovery needs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10333v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Disordered spatial networks are model systems that describe structures and interactions across multiple length scales. Scattering and interference of waves in these networks can give rise to structural phase transitions, localization, diffusion, and band gaps. The study of these complex phenomena requires efficient numerical methods to computer-generate disordered networks with targeted structural properties. In the established Wooten-Weaire-Winer algorithm, a series of bond switch moves introduces disorder into an initial network. Conventional strain energies that govern this evolution are limited to 3D networks with coordination numbers of no more than four. We extend the algorithm to arbitrary coordination number statistics by introducing bond repulsion in the Keating strain energy. We tune the degree and type of disorder introduced into initially crystalline networks by varying the bond-bending force constant in the strain energy and the temperature profile. The effects of these variables are analyzed using a list of order metrics that capture both direct and reciprocal space. A feedforward neural network is trained to predict the structural characteristics from the algorithm inputs, enabling targeted network generation. As a case study, we statistically reproduce four disordered biophotonic networks exhibiting structural color. This work presents a versatile method for generating disordered networks with tailored structural properties. It will enable new insights into structure-property relations, such as photonic band gaps in disordered networks.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10684v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Scaling laws have played a major role in the modern AI revolution, providing practitioners predictive power over how the model performance will improve with increasing data, compute, and number of model parameters. This has spurred an intense interest in the origin of neural scaling laws, with a common suggestion being that they arise from power law structure already present in the data. In this paper we study scaling laws for transformers trained to predict random walks (bigrams) on graphs with tunable complexity. We demonstrate that this simplified setting already gives rise to neural scaling laws even in the absence of power law structure in the data correlations. We further consider dialing down the complexity of natural language systematically, by training on sequences sampled from increasingly simplified generative language models, from 4,2,1-layer transformer language models down to language bigrams, revealing a monotonic evolution of the scaling exponents. Our results also include scaling laws obtained from training on random walks on random graphs drawn from Erd\&quot;os-Renyi and scale-free Barab\&#x27;asi-Albert ensembles. Finally, we revisit conventional scaling laws for language modeling, demonstrating that several essential results can be reproduced using 2 layer transformers with context length of 50, provide a critical analysis of various fits used in prior literature, demonstrate an alternative method for obtaining compute optimal curves as compared with current practice in published literature, and provide preliminary evidence that maximal update parameterization may be more parameter efficient than standard parameterization.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces an LLM-guided evolutionary framework (MPaGE) for designing diverse, fast heuristics in multi-objective combinatorial optimization, with relevance limited to the generic concept of evolution rather than origins-of-life science.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2507.20923v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOP) frequently arise in practical applications that require the simultaneous optimization of conflicting objectives. Although traditional evolutionary algorithms can be effective, they typically depend on domain knowledge and repeated parameter tuning, limiting flexibility when applied to unseen MOCOP instances. Recently, integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into evolutionary computation has opened new avenues for automatic heuristic generation, using their advanced language understanding and code synthesis capabilities. Nevertheless, most existing approaches predominantly focus on single-objective tasks, often neglecting key considerations such as runtime efficiency and heuristic diversity in multi-objective settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-heuristics for MOCOP via Pareto-Grid-guided Evolution of LLMs (MPaGE), a novel enhancement of the Simple Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization (SEMO) framework that leverages LLMs and Pareto Front Grid (PFG) technique. By partitioning the objective space into grids and retaining top-performing candidates to guide heuristic generation, MPaGE utilizes LLMs to prioritize heuristics with semantically distinct logical structures during variation, thus promoting diversity and mitigating redundancy within the population. Through extensive evaluations, MPaGE demonstrates superior performance over existing LLM-based frameworks, and achieves competitive results to traditional Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs), with significantly faster runtime.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.09835v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Secular perturbations from binary stars and distant massive planets can drive cold planets onto nearly parabolic orbits with pericenter passages extremely close to their host stars. Meanwhile, short-period super-Earths are frequently observed around nearby stars. Gravitational scattering between these two distinct populations can lead to substantial orbital energy exchange, liberating some intruders from the gravitational confinement of their host systems. This process offers a robust formation channel for a subset of the abundant freely floating planet population. It may also significantly perturb the original orbits of close-in planets, induce collisional trajectories between close-in planets and their host stars, and disrupt the dynamical evolution of cold planets toward close stellar encounters.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.09845v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Predicting biomolecular thermodynamics and spectroscopy requires accurate relative energies of metastable states and local curvatures on the potential-energy surface. We show that the general-purpose SO3LR machine-learned force field (MLFF) reproduces PBE0+MBD density-functional theory with unprecedented fidelity across bio-relevant molecules spanning sizes and complexities far beyond its training dataset. For 23 small molecules, SO3LR captures harmonic and anharmonic vibrational features, including frequencies, displacement patterns, and IR spectra. We perform detailed dynamical studies of the amino acid oF-Phe+, folding of the alanine-15 peptide, and assembly of monomeric p53 transactivation domains into tetramers, in vacuum and water. SO3LR consistently reproduces DFT-level potential-energy surfaces, vibrational densities of states, and mode eigenvectors, capturing anharmonicity, polarization, and medium-range environment-driven interactions crucial for proteins. Our results establish that MLFF-driven dynamics provide a quantum-accurate picture of metastable minima and vibrational properties, achieving DFT-level accuracy at force-field computational cost and opening new possibilities for the computational study of biomolecules.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10181v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Climate prediction is a challenge due to the intricate spatiotemporal patterns within Earth systems. Global climate indices, such as the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation, are standard input features for long-term rainfall prediction. However, a significant gap persists regarding local-scale indices capable of improving predictive accuracy in specific regions of Thailand. This paper introduces a novel NorthEast monsoon climate index calculated from sea surface temperature to reflect the climatology of the boreal winter monsoon. To optimise the calculated areas used for this index, a Deep Q-Network reinforcement learning agent explores and selects the most effective rectangles based on their correlation with seasonal rainfall. Rainfall stations were classified into 12 distinct clusters to distinguish rainfall patterns between southern and upper Thailand. Experimental results show that incorporating the optimised index into Long Short-Term Memory models significantly improves long-term monthly rainfall prediction skill in most cluster areas. This approach effectively reduces the Root Mean Square Error for 12-month-ahead forecasts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10508v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Planet population synthesis is an integral tool for linking exoplanets to their formation environments. Most planet population synthesis studies have focused on the carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) in gas or solids, yet more insight into planet formation may be afforded by considering a wider suite of elements. Sulfur is one such key element. It has been assumed to be entirely refractory in population synthesis models, restricting it to being a tracer of accreted rocky solids. However, sulfur also has a volatile reservoir dominant at the onset of star and planet formation. We investigate sulfur&#x27;s wider potential as a formation history tracer by implementing the first multi-phase treatment of S in a planet population synthesis model. We present the planet formation module of \textsc{sponchpop} and its first predicted planet growth tracks and populations. We explore the diversity of planet compositions in terms of their sulfur budget, including both refractory and volatile components, and apply a novel gas-grain conversion of sulfur to study how formation trajectories of giant planets relate to final core and envelope compositions. We show that planets inherit a wide range of core and envelope sulfur content related to accretion history while considering late-stage planetesimal infall, providing a new diagnostic tool for planet formation. The diverse sulfur content of planet cores suggests some rocky planets may be born sulfur-poor, with implications for their geochemistry and habitability. Enhanced sulfur abundances in gas-giant atmospheres can be attributed to formation beyond the H2S iceline, such as the giants in our Solar System.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10285v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Past studies have revealed the dependency of the disc parameters (mass, radius, viscosity, grain fragmentation velocity, dust-to-gas ratio) on the formation of giant planets, where more massive discs seem beneficial for giant planet formation. It is unclear how the different disc properties influence the composition of forming giant planets. The idea that the atmospheric abundances can trace directly the formation location of planets is put into question, due to the chemical evolution of the disc, caused by inward drifting and evaporating pebbles. This complicates the idea of a relation between atmospheric abundances and planet formation locations. We use planet formation simulations that include the effects of pebble drift and evaporation and investigate how the different disc parameters influence the atmospheric composition of giant planets. We focus on the atmospheric C/O, C/H, O/H and S/H ratios allowing us to probe tracers for volatiles and refractories and thus different accretion pathways of giant planets. We find that most of the disc parameters have only a limited influence on the atmospheric abundances of gas giants, except for the dust-to-gas ratio, where a larger value results in higher atmospheric abundances. However the atmospheric abundances are determined by the planetary formation location, even in the pebble drift and evaporation scenario. Our study suggests that volatile-rich giant exoplanets predominantly form in the inner disc regions, where they can accrete large fractions of vapour-enhanced gas. Our study shows that simulations that try to trace the origin of giant planets via their atmospheric abundances do not have to probe all disc parameters, as long as the disc parameters allow the formation of giant planets. Our study thus suggests that the diversity of observed planetary compositions is a direct consequence of their formation location and migration history.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10450v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The structure and evolution of close-in exoplanets are shaped by atmospheric loss and migration processes, which give rise to key population features such as the hot Neptune desert, ridge, and savanna - regions of the period-radius space whose boundaries offer critical insights into planetary formation and survival. As part of the KESPRINT collaboration, we selected the TESS transiting planet candidate TOI-3862.01 for radial velocity follow-up to confirm its planetary nature and characterize its mass and bulk properties. This planet candidate is of particular interest due to its position in the middle of the hot Neptune desert, making it a valuable probe for testing theories of planet migration and atmospheric loss. We confirmed the planetary nature and determined the mass of TOI-3862.01 (hereinafter TOI-3862b) by performing a joint fit with both transit and radial velocity data, precisely characterizing the bulk properties of this planet. TOI-3862b is a super-Neptune on a 1.56-day orbit around a Sun-like star with an effective temperature of 5300$\pm$50K. It has a mass of 53.7$_{-2.9}^{+2.8}$ M$_{\oplus}$ and a radius of 5.53$\pm$0.18 R$_{\oplus}$, corresponding to a density of 1.7$\pm$0.2 g/cm^3. This places it among the rare population of hot and dense super-Neptune desert planets. TOI-3862b, residing deep in the hot Neptune desert, represents a rare occurrence in an otherwise sparsely populated region, offering a valuable opportunity to probe the processes that may allow planets to survive in such environments.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10666v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The near-Earth asteroid 2024 YR4 -- a $\sim$60 m rocky object that was once considered a potential Earth impactor -- has since been ruled out for Earth but retained a $\sim$4.3% probability of striking the Moon in 2032. Such an impact, with equivalent kinetic energy of $\sim$6.5 Mt TNT, is expected to produce a $\sim$1 km crater on the Moon, and will be the most energetic lunar impact event ever recorded in human history. Despite the associated risk, this scenario offers a rare and valuable scientific opportunity. Using a hybrid framework combining Monte Carlo orbital propagation, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) impact modeling, and N-body ejecta dynamics, we evaluate the physical outcomes and propose the observation timelines of this rare event. Our results suggest an optical flash of visual magnitude from -2.5 to -3 lasting several minutes directly after the impact, followed by hours of infrared afterglow from $\sim$2000 K molten rock cooling to a few hundred K. The associated seismic energy release would lead to a global-scale lunar reverberation (magnitude $\sim$5.0) that can be detectable by modern seismometers. Furthermore, the impact would eject $\sim$10$^8$ kg of debris that escapes the lunar gravity, with a small fraction reaching Earth to produce a lunar meteor outburst within 100 years. Finally, we integrate these results into a coordinated observation timeline, identifying the best detection windows for ground-based telescopes, lunar orbiters, and surface stations.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10598v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The Galaxy&#x27;s most common known planetary systems have several Earth-to-Neptune-size planets in compact orbits. At small orbital separations, larger planets are less common than their smaller counterparts by an order of magnitude. The young star V1298 Tau hosts one such compact planetary system, albeit with four planets that are uncommonly large (5 to 10 Earth radii). The planets form a chain of near-resonances that result in transit-timing variations of several hours. Here we present a multi-year campaign to characterize this system with transit-timing variations, a method insensitive to the intense magnetic activity of the star. Through targeted observations, we first resolved the previously unknown orbital period of the outermost planet. The full 9-year baseline from these and archival data then enabled robust determination of the masses and orbital parameters for all four planets. We find the planets have low, sub-Neptune masses and nearly circular orbits, implying a dynamically tranquil history. Their low masses and large radii indicate that the inner planets underwent a period of rapid cooling immediately after dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Still, they are much less dense than mature planets of comparable size. We predict the planets will contract to 1.5-4.0 Earth radii and join the population of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes that nature produces in abundance.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2501.14054v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: While most of the 6000 discovered exoplanets are highly unlike the Earth, the first rocky worlds in the Habitable Zone (HZ) provide intriguing targets for the search for life in the cosmos. As detections increase, it is critical to test the empirical HZ as well as its limits using known exoplanets. However, there is not yet a list of rocky worlds that observers can use to test the limits of surface habitability. We analysed data from Gaia DR3 and the NASA Exoplanet Archive (NEA) of all known exoplanets, identifying future targets to test limits of habitability through i) orbits near the edges of the HZ, ii) similar irradiation environments to modern Earth, and iii) large eccentricities. We prioritize targets for transmission observations, light curve measurements, and direct imaging, identify the oldest HZ rocky worlds based on the NEA and complementary literature data, and provide theoretical limits for the empirical HZ and a 3D-HZ for each system. Our analysis shows 45 rocky worlds in the empirical HZ and 24 in a narrower 3D-HZ. For context, we compare their demographics to those of the full catalog of exoplanets in the NEA. The resulting list of rocky exoplanet targets in the HZ will allow observers to shape and optimize search strategies with space- and ground-based telescopes -- such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), and LIFE -- and design new observing strategies and instruments to explore these worlds, addressing the question of the limits of exoplanet surface habitability.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2510.08681v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Many evolutionary models of giant exoplanets still rely on simplifying assumptions that are no longer adequate given detailed constraints from Jupiter, Saturn, and modern exoplanet observations. Here, we identify the key physical improvements required for next-generation planetary evolution models using our code, \texttt{APPLE}, which enables systematic emulation and extension of legacy studies. We quantify the effects of updated equations of state, helium rain, fuzzy cores, non-adiabatic and compositionally inhomogeneous envelopes, and improved atmospheric boundary conditions by first isolating the impact of each physical ingredient and then constructing combined baseline models for planets with masses between 0.3 and 4~$M_{\rm Jup}$ to assess their collective influence on planetary structure and observable properties. We find that the adoption of modern equations of state and realistic heavy-element distributions leads to systematic, but sometimes subtle, differences ($\sim 5$ to 10\%) in radius evolution, while helium rain and the treatment of convection can significantly alter thermal histories and atmospheric compositions (by $\sim$ 5 to 20\%). These updated physical processes must be incorporated into the next-generation exoplanet evolutionary models to achieve physically consistent interpretations of planetary observations.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10032v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The presence of correlated noise, arising from a mixture of independent fluctuations and a common noisy input shared across the neural population, is a ubiquitous feature of neural circuits, yet its impact on collective network dynamics remains poorly understood. We analyze a network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons driven by Gaussian noise with a tunable degree of correlation. Using the cumulant expansion method, we derive a reduced set of effective mean-field equations that accurately describe the evolution of the population&#x27;s mean firing rate and membrane potential. Our analysis reveals a counterintuitive phenomenon: increasing the noise correlation strength suppresses the mean network activity, an effect we term correlated-noise-inhibited spiking. Furthermore, within a specific parameter regime, the network exhibits metastability, manifesting itself as spontaneous, noise-driven transitions between distinct high- and low-activity states. These results provide a theoretical framework for reducing the dynamics of complex stochastic networks and demonstrate how correlated noise can fundamentally regulate macroscopic neural activity, with implications for understanding state transitions in biological systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2510.11490v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Sub-Neptunes with planetary radii of $R_{p} \simeq 2-4 R_{\oplus}$ are the most common planets around solar-type stars in short-period ($P&lt;100$ d) orbits. It is still unclear, however, what their most likely composition is, that is whether they are predominantly gas dwarfs or water worlds. The sub-Neptunes orbiting bright host stars are very valuable because they are suitable for atmospheric characterization, which can break the well-known degeneracy in planet composition from the planet bulk density, when combined with a precise and accurate mass measurement. Here we report on the characterization of the sub-Neptune TOI-5789 c, which transits in front of the bright ($V=7.3$ mag and $K_{s}=5.35$ mag) and magnetically inactive K1V dwarf HIP 99452 every 12.93 days, thanks to TESS photometry and 141 high-precision radial velocities obtained with the HARPS-N spectrograph. We find that its radius, mass, and bulk density are $R_{c}=2.86^{+0.18}_{-0.15} R_\oplus$, $M_{c}=5.00 \pm 0.50 M_\oplus$, and $\rho_{c}=1.16 \pm 0.23$ g cm$^{-3}$, and we show that TOI-5789 c is a promising target for atmospheric characterization with both JWST and, in the future, Ariel. By analyzing the HARPS-N radial velocities with different tools, we also detect three additional non-transiting planets, namely TOI-5789 b, d, and e, with orbital periods and minimum masses of $P_{b}=2.76$ d, $M_{b}\sin{i}=2.12 \pm 0.28 M_\oplus$, $P_{d}=29.6$ d, $M_{d}\sin{i}=4.29 \pm 0.68 M_\oplus$, and $P_{e}=63.0$ d, $M_{e}\sin{i}=11.61 \pm 0.97 M_\oplus$. TOI-5789 is a mutually inclined system as the difference between the orbital inclinations of planets b and c must be higher than $\sim4$ deg. Nevertheless, from sensitivity studies based on both the HARPS-N and archival HIRES radial-velocity measurements, we can exclude that these relatively high mutual inclinations are due to the perturbation by an outer gaseous giant planet.</p>

Memory functions of dipole rotations for polar liquids have never been calculated. We present here calculations of memory functions for single-dipole rotations and for the overall dipole moment of the sample for SPC/E water. The memory functions for single-particle and collective dipole dynamics turn out to be nearly identical. This result validates theories of dielectric spectroscopy in terms of single-particle time correlation functions and the connection between the collective and single-particle relaxation times through the Kirkwood factor. The dielectric function in this formalism contains no new dynamic information that does not exist in the single-dipole correlation function.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2501.13188v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: All intelligence is collective intelligence, in the sense that it is made of parts which must align with respect to system-level goals. Understanding the dynamics which facilitate or limit navigation of problem spaces by aligned parts thus impacts many fields ranging across life sciences and engineering. To that end, consider a system on the vertices of a planar graph, with pairwise interactions prescribed by the edges of the graph. Such systems can sometimes exhibit long-range order, distinguishing one phase of macroscopic behaviour from another. In networks of interacting systems we may view spontaneous ordering as a form of self-organisation, modelling neural and basal forms of cognition. Here, we discuss necessary conditions on the topology of the graph for an ordered phase to exist, with an eye towards finding constraints on the ability of a system with local interactions to maintain an ordered target state. By studying the scaling of free energy under the formation of domain walls in three model systems -- the Potts model, autoregressive models, and hierarchical networks -- we show how the combinatorics of interactions on a graph prevent or allow spontaneous ordering. As an application we are able to analyse why multiscale systems like those prevalent in biology are capable of organising into complex patterns, whereas rudimentary language models are challenged by long sequences of outputs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2506.05053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Liquid crystal mesophases of achiral molecules are normally achiral, yet in a few materials they spontaneously segregate and form right- and left-handed chiral domains. One mechanism that drives chiral segregation is molecular shape fluctuations between axial chiral conformations, where molecular interactions favor matching chirality and promote helical twist. Cooperative chiral ordering may also play a role in chirality amplification, as when a tiny fraction of chiral dopant drives a nematic phase to become cholesteric. We present a model of cooperative chiral ordering in liquid crystals using Maier-Saupe theory, and predict a phase diagram with a segregated cholesteric phase with alternating domains of left- and right-handed chiral twist, with opposite enantiomeric excess, in addition to racemic nematic and isotropic phases. Our model also demonstrates how chiral molecular fluctuations influence the helical twisting power of dopants in the nematic phase, which may be observed even in materials where the segregated cholesteric phase is preempted by a transition to another phase. We compare these results with Monte Carlo simulation studies of the switchable chiral Lebwohl-Lasher model, where each spin switches between right- and left-handed chiral states. Simulation results validate the predicted phase diagram, demonstrate chiral amplification in the racemic nematic phase, and reveal complex coarsening dynamics in the segregated cholesteric phase. These results suggest that molecular fluctuations between degenerate chiral configurations may be a common mechanism to produce cooperative chiral order in achiral liquid crystals.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.09915v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Effective water management is essential for the optimal performance of PEM fuel cells. We have developed an impedance model for liquid water transport through the membrane and coupled it with the two-phase model for cathode side impedance. The complete model was fitted to experimental spectra measured at anode/cathode relative humidities (RH) of 32/32\%, 50/50\% and 100/100\% within a current density range of 100 to 1000 mA cm$^{-2}$ and an air flow stoichiometry of 2. Cathode catalyst layer (CCL) saturation decreases with current density due to a growing liquid pressure gradient. For all RH values, the CCL oxygen diffusivity increases dramatically with cell current due to progressive involvement of larger pores into the proton current conversion. Higher RH leads to higher double layer capacitance, which indicates that liquid water increases the electrochemically active surface area.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.09845v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Predicting biomolecular thermodynamics and spectroscopy requires accurate relative energies of metastable states and local curvatures on the potential-energy surface. We show that the general-purpose SO3LR machine-learned force field (MLFF) reproduces PBE0+MBD density-functional theory with unprecedented fidelity across bio-relevant molecules spanning sizes and complexities far beyond its training dataset. For 23 small molecules, SO3LR captures harmonic and anharmonic vibrational features, including frequencies, displacement patterns, and IR spectra. We perform detailed dynamical studies of the amino acid oF-Phe+, folding of the alanine-15 peptide, and assembly of monomeric p53 transactivation domains into tetramers, in vacuum and water. SO3LR consistently reproduces DFT-level potential-energy surfaces, vibrational densities of states, and mode eigenvectors, capturing anharmonicity, polarization, and medium-range environment-driven interactions crucial for proteins. Our results establish that MLFF-driven dynamics provide a quantum-accurate picture of metastable minima and vibrational properties, achieving DFT-level accuracy at force-field computational cost and opening new possibilities for the computational study of biomolecules.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10166v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Quantum algorithms are gaining attention in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for their favorable scaling, as encoding physical fields into quantum probability amplitudes enables representation of two to the power of n spatial points with only n qubits. A key challenge in Quantum CFD is the efficient readout of simulation results, a topic that has received limited attention in literature. This work presents methods to extract statistical properties of spatial velocity fields, such as central moments and structure functions, directly from parameterized ansatz circuits, avoiding full quantum state tomography. As a proof of concept, we implement our approach for 1D velocity fields, encoding 16 spatial points with 4 qubits, and analyze both a sine wave signal and four snapshots from Burgers&#x27; equation evolution. Using Qedma&#x27;s error mitigation software QESEM, we demonstrate that such computations achieve high accuracy on current quantum devices, specifically IBMQ&#x27;s Heron2 system ibm_fez.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2501.05613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Cryogenic buffer gas sources are ubiquitous for producing cold, collimated molecular beams for quantum science, chemistry, and precision measurements. The molecules are typically produced by laser ablating a metal target in the presence of a donor gas. The radical of interest emerges due to a barrier-free reaction or under thermal or optical excitation. High-barrier reactions, such as between Ca and H$_2$, should be precluded. We study chemical reactions between Ca and three hydrogen isotopologues H$_2$, D$_2$, and HD in a cryogenic cell with helium buffer gas. We observe that H$_2$ can serve as both a reactant and a buffer gas, outperforming D$_2$ and HD. We use a reaction network model to describe the chemical dynamics and find that the enhanced molecular yield can be attributed to rapid vibrational excitations of the reactant gas. Our results demonstrate a robust method for generating bright cold beams of alkaline-earth-metal hydrides for laser cooling and trapping.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2507.13253v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: There has been a long debate on how new levels of organization have evolved. It might seem unlikely, as cooperation must prevail over competition. One well-studied example is the emergence of autocatalytic sets, which seem to be a prerequisite for the evolution of life. Using a simple model, we investigate how varying bias toward cooperation versus antagonism shapes network dynamics, revealing that higher-order organization emerges even amid pervasive antagonistic interactions. In general, we observe that a quantitative increase in the number of elements in a system leads to a qualitative transition. We present a random threshold-directed network model that integrates node-specific traits with dynamic edge formation and node removal, simulating arbitrary levels of cooperation and competition. In our framework, intrinsic node values determine directed links through various threshold rules. Our model generates a multi-digraph with signed edges (reflecting support/antagonism, labeled ``help&#x27;&#x27;/``harm&#x27;&#x27;), which ultimately yields two parallel yet interdependent threshold graphs. Incorporating temporal growth and node turnover in our approach allows exploration of the evolution, adaptation, and potential collapse of communities and reveals phase transitions in both connectivity and resilience. Our findings extend classical random threshold and Erd\H{o}s-R\&#x27;enyi models, offering new insights into adaptive systems in biological and economic contexts, with emphasis on the application to Collective Affordance Sets. This framework should also be useful for making predictions that will be tested by ongoing experiments of microbial communities in soil.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.10364v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recruitment dynamics, or the distribution of the number of offspring among individuals, is central for understanding ecology and evolution. Sweepstakes reproduction (heavy right-tailed offspring number distribution) is central for understanding the ecology and evolution of highly fecund natural populations. Sweepstakes reproduction can induce jumps in type frequencies and multiple mergers in gene genealogies of sampled gene copies. We take sweepstakes reproduction to be skewed offspring number distribution due to mechanisms not involving natural selection, such as in chance matching of broadcast spawning with favourable environmental conditions. Here, we consider population genetic models of sweepstakes reproduction in a diploid panmictic populations absent selfing and evolving in a random environment. Our main results are {\it (i)} continuous-time Beta and Poisson-Dirichlet coalescents, when combining the results the skewness parameter $\alpha$ of the Beta-coalescent ranges from $0$ to $2$, and the Beta-coalescents may be incomplete due to an upper bound on the number of potential offspring produced by any pair of parents; {\it (ii)} in large populations time is measured in units proportional to either $N/\log N$ or $N$ generations (where $2N$ is the population size when constant); {\it (iii)} it follows that incorporating population size changes leads to time-changed coalescents with the time-change independent of $\alpha$; {\it (iv)} using simulations we show that the ancestral process is not well approximated by the corresponding coalescent (as measured through certain functionals of the processes); {\it (v)} whenever the skewness of the offspring number distribution is increased the conditional (conditioned on the population ancestry) and the unconditional ancestral processes are not in good agreement.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Preprint dissects how genotoxic stress in breast cancer cells triggers alternative p21-dependent routes to whole-genome duplication and a shared CDK4/6-dependent polyploid G0 state, suggesting a therapeutic strategy to block WGD-driven tumor evolution.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Whole-genome duplication (WGD) fuels tumor evolution and therapy resistance, yet the molecular mechanisms governing the switch from the canonical mitotic cell cycle to the endoreplication cycle remain unclear. Here, we combine single-cell proteomics, manifold learning, and live-cell imaging to map the intersection of the mitotic and endoreplication cycles in breast cancer cells exposed to genotoxic agents. We identify two distinct routes to WGD driven by distinct p21 dynamics. High p21 induction induces G2 exit and endocycling, whereas insufficient p21 permits mitotic entry followed by slippage and endomitosis. This therapy-induced switch acts as a facultative stress response, generating drug-resistant polyploid populations that propagate genomic instability through replication stress and the generation of replication-competent micronuclei. Both paths to WGD converge on a common polyploid G0 state dependent on cyclin D1:CDK4/6 activity to complete the transition to the endoreplication cycle, revealing a shared vulnerability. Sequential treatment with genotoxic agents followed by CDK4/6 inhibitors preserves the cytotoxic efficacy of DNA-damaging drugs while simultaneously blocking entry into the endoreplication cycle and WGD-driven evolutionary rescue. These findings reveal the molecular rules governing the switch from the mitotic to endoreplication cycle and highlight the potential of WGD-blocking drugs as adjuvant therapies to inhibit drug resistance and suppress tumor evolution.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, relies heavily on glycolysis for ATP production, making glycolytic enzymes attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. In this study, we report high-resolution crystal structures of two essential glycolytic enzymes, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (Tc PGI; 1.8 A) and enolase (Tc enolase; 2.4 A), and integrate structural, biophysical, and computational analyses to evaluate their drug-target potential. Tc PGI adopts a dimeric alpha-beta-alpha sandwich fold and contains a parasite-specific 53-residue N-terminal extension and a distinctive C-terminal hook region that are absent in the human ortholog. Tc enolase displays the conserved (alpha/beta)8 TIM-barrel architecture but exhibits localized structural differences, including an extended alpha17 helix and a structured alpha1 region, relative to human isoforms. Both enzymes exhibit high thermal stability, consistent with adaptation to the parasite&#x27;s complex life cycle. Structure-based virtual screening using a scaffold previously associated with multi-target inhibition identified candidate ligands with favorable docking scores for each enzyme. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations and binding free-energy analyses supported stable enzyme-ligand interactions and favorable energetic profiles. Together, these results define parasite-specific structural features of two key glycolytic enzymes and provide a structural framework for future experimental validation and structure-guided development of selective antiparasitic inhibitors.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mitochondrial homeostasis is maintained by multiple molecular chaperones and proteases located within the organelle. The mitochondrial matrix-localized protease LONP-1 degrades oxidatively damaged or misfolded proteins. Importantly, LONP-1 also regulates mitochondrial DNA replication. Here, we show that mutations in C. elegans that impair LONP-1 function cause dysregulation of mitochondrial DNA replication, mitochondrial RNA transcription and protein synthesis within the mitochondrial matrix. LONP-1 deficient worms had reduced levels of oxidative phosphorylation proteins despite increased mtDNA-encoded protein synthesis. Via a forward genetic screen, we identified three mutations that restored mitochondrial function and the rate of development in lonp-1 mutants to levels comparable to those in wildtype worms. Interestingly, all three suppressor mutations were found in genes encoding mitochondrial ribosome proteins. A point mutation in the mitochondrial ribosome protein MRPS-38 restored oxidative phosphorylation in lonp-1 mutant worms. Combined, our results suggest that LONP-1 regulates mitochondrial protein synthesis and that the suppressor mutations within MRPS-38 or MRPS-15 enhance oxidative phosphorylation complex assembly by slowing translation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Although recent advances in genomics have enabled the high-resolution study of whole genomes, our understanding of one of the key evolutionary processes, mutation, still remains limited. In primates specifically, studies have largely focused on humans and their closest evolutionary relatives, the great apes, as well as a handful of species of biomedical or conservation interest. Yet, as biological variation in mutation rates has been shown to vary across genomic regions, individuals, and species, a greater understanding of the underlying evolutionary dynamics at play will ultimately be illuminated by not only additional sampling across the Order, but also by a greater depth of sampling within-species. To address these needs, we here present the first population-scale genomic resources for a platyrrhine of considerable biomedical interest for both social behavior and neurobiology, the coppery titi monkey (Plecturocebus cupreus). Deep whole-genome sequencing of 15 parent-offspring trios, together with a computational de novo mutation detection pipeline based on pan-genome graphs, has provided a detailed picture of the sex-averaged mutation rate -- 0.63 x 10-8 (95% CI: 0.43 x 10-8 - 0.90 x 10-8) per site per generation -- as well as the effects of both sex and parental age on underlying rates, demonstrating a significant paternal age effect. Coppery titi monkey males exhibit long reproductive lifespans, afforded by long-term pair bonding in the species&#x27; monogamous mating system, and our results have demonstrated that individuals reproducing later in life exhibit one of the strongest male mutation biases observed in any non-human primate studied to date. Taken together, this study thus provides an important piece of the puzzle for better comprehending the mutational landscape across primates.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Labyrinthulomycetes are ubiquitous marine decomposers and include the thraustochytrids, a lineage known for their extensive production of polyunsaturated fatty acids and biotechnology applications. Despite historical taxonomic confusion, environmental surveys have begun to expand the known diversity within labyrinthulomycetes. Here we present 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences from 17 novel labyrinthulomycetes strains established as axenic cultures from natural samples taken from three locations in Nova Scotia, Canada. We also present light and transmission electron microscopic analysis for three of these isolates. The combination of phylogenetic and morphological analysis suggests that these isolates belong to three different genera, Thraustochytrium, Ulkenia and Oblongichytrium. Our results expand the known genetic diversity of labyrinthulomycetes in Atlantic Canadian waters, contributing new strains to understudied genera for future comparative genomic investigations, including Ulkenia and Oblongichytrium for which very few genomic resources are available.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Synthetic communication networks are key to engineering life-like behaviors in artificial cells. Inspired by natural quorum sensing, we developed a coacervate-based system that exhibits quorum-sensing-like communication, driven by an autocatalytic trypsin–trypsinogen feedback loop. These membraneless compartments enable diffusion and amplification of signaling molecules, resulting in population density–dependent collective activation analogous to natural quorum responses. At high population density, signal accumulation triggers a system-wide fluorescent response, whereas at low population density, signaling remains off. By varying trypsin, trypsinogen, and population density, the activation threshold shifted over nearly an order of magnitude, with a fourfold acceleration in signal amplification at high population density. This gene-free platform establishes a minimal route to programmable, collective dynamics in synthetic protocell community.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> -Conotoxins (-CTX) are disulfide-rich peptide antagonists with exceptional potency and subtype selectivity across nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), making them promising leads for therapeutic development. The molecular basis of their specificity has remained unresolved for decades, limiting rational drug design. Here, we present the first high-resolution cryo-EM structures of full-length muscle-type nAChR bound to three distinct -CTXs, revealing their precise binding modes at both acetylcholine binding sites. Our integrated approach, combining structural biology, pharmacological profiling, and computational hydration mapping, uncovers conserved pharmacophore features, water-mediated interactions, and subunit-specific determinants that govern potency and selectivity. These findings provide a long-sought molecular framework for -conotoxin recognition and inhibition, addressing a critical gap required to realise the full potential of conotoxins as lead compounds in drug discovery.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Comparative transcriptomics across pancrustaceans shows moulting is governed by a mix of deeply conserved and lineage-specific gene-expression modules, with the mid-moult phase being most lineage-specific (an inverse hourglass pattern).</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Arthropods such as insects and crustaceans, which together form the monophyletic group Pancrustacea, possess a rigid chitinous exoskeleton that must be periodically shed through moulting to allow growth and morphological change. Although moulting is a deeply conserved developmental process across Arthropoda, our understanding of its molecular mechanisms is still largely derived from insect model species. Lineage-specific innovations and losses of moulting related genes raise fundamental questions on the extent of its conservation outside non-insect arthropods. Here, we investigate the evolutionary conservation of moulting gene expression across five representative pancrustacean species. Changes in gene expression during moulting are characterized by both deeply conserved and lineage-specific gene modules. Time-series gene expression analyses reveal that these lineage-specific signatures are not uniformly distributed across the moulting process: the middle transitional phase is more lineage-specific, thereby exhibiting an inverse hourglass pattern. This is likely due to life-history specific processes, development of the cuticle and specialized structures of the exoskeleton. Overall, this study provides evidence for both the evolutionary conservation and divergence of this key post-embryonic developmental process and highlights the modular architecture of the moulting programme.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cutaneous wound healing is a multifaceted physiological process that requires a cell state transition from homeostasis to tissue repair. An important contributor to this reprogramming is the wound-induced mechanical cues that are perceived by epidermal keratinocytes. Previously we identified that the nuclear translocation of the de novo DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3a), upon wounding as an important regulator of this cell-state transition. However, the molecular mechanisms linking mechanotransduction to epigenetic regulation remain incompletely understood. Here we show that under homeostasis, active ERK1/2 phosphorylates DNMT3a, intramolecularly masking its nuclear localization signal (NLS), resulting in its cytoplasmic sequestration. Upon wounding actin cytoskeleton remodeling leads to the downregulation of the Extracellular Signal-Related Kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) pathway. Wound-induced ERK1/2 inactivation unmasks the NLS, enabling DNMT3a nuclear translocation. Collectively, these findings define a mechanotransduction-driven signaling axis linking cytoskeletal dynamics to epigenetic regulation and confirms an active role for differentiated keratinocytes in initiating early wound repair programs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> PPO inhibiting herbicides are widely used to manage weeds in different cropping systems, yet resistance evolution threatens their long term efficacy. Here, we investigated the molecular basis of resistance to PPO inhibiting herbicides in Bassia scoparia biotypes collected from four locations in North Dakota, USA. Greenhouse dose response assays revealed high levels of resistance to saflufenacil and carfentrazone-ethyl, while fomesafen retained full efficacy across all biotypes. Resistant plants did not show increased copy number or elevated expression of PPO1 or PPO2. Sequencing of survivor plants revealed conserved PPO2 sequences, but consistent target-site substitutions at position F454 in PPO1, including F454I, F454L, and F454V. In vitro enzyme assays demonstrated that these substitutions impair PPO1 sensitivity to saflufenacil and carfentrazone ethyl, but not to fomesafen. Ectopic expression of B. scoparia PPO1 F454 mutant variants in Arabidopsis thaliana conferred tolerance to saflufenacil and carfentrazone ethyl, but not to fomesafen, supporting greenhouse and in vitro results. Molecular modeling indicated that the conformational flexibility and interaction profile of fomesafen enables it to maintain binding to mutated PPO1 variants, in contrast to the more rigid structures of saflufenacil and carfentrazone ethyl. A yeast-based complementation system further confirmed that F454 substitutions decrease herbicide sensitivity. In addition, developmental profiling showed distinct expression patterns of PPO1 and PPO2 during early growth stages in B. scoparia and Amaranthus spp., highlighting isoform-specific roles. Together, these findings represent the first reported PPO1 target-site mutations in a broadleaf weed species as a key mechanism of resistance and highlight that fomesafen is effective to control resistant B. scoparia populations.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In major diseases like cancer, many genes are dysregulated. While differential expression (DE) analyses help identify these genes, they do not reveal the transcriptional regulatory landscape between control and disease states. Here, we developed a process-driven model based on generalized stochastic transcriptional regulation (TR) to study DE genes in ovarian cancer. We generated over 39,000 synthetic gene expression profiles based on RNA-seq dataset of 11 samples (5 control FTE and 6 ovarian cancer), and fitted the model parameters to real data achieving between 82% and 99% transcriptome-wide similarity through various data analytics. Through the model we investigated the top 100 DE genes transcriptional regulation. Notably, GSTA3, SNTN, DNAI2 and KIF19, which have been associated with cancer, possess significantly larger transcriptional quantal and RNA degradation rates, leading to their greater variability in cancer. This mechanistic understanding could potentially guide gene-targeted interventions for cancer or other diseases in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) mediate selective transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, but also contribute to maintaining genome stability. Mutations in NPC genes cause genome instability and sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, and DNA that is difficult to repair or replicate relocates to NPCs, including expanded CAG repeats, which are associated with several neurological diseases. Here, we show that other disease-related short tandem repeats also relocate to NPCs. Relocation depends on the NPC basket protein Nup1, but is independent of the rest of the basket. Abrogating relocation to the NPC increases rates of repeat contraction, but not expansion. By contrast, deletion of the basket component NUP60, which causes mislocalization of all other basket proteins except Nup1, results in greater genome instability without affecting relocation to NPCs. Our results show that NPC association is a general feature of disease-related short tandem repeats, and suggest that relocation to NPCs is separable from the other genome maintenance functions of the NPC basket.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Reports a mechanically interlocked indigo [2]-rotaxane photoswitch whose topologically constrained supramolecular interactions enable 730 nm (NIR) switching and greatly extend thermal half-life, with potential relevance to molecular machines rather than origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Photoswitches provide the opportunity to remotely and precisely control matter on the nanoscopic scale. For many materials and biological applications, photoswitches with long wavelength response are essential, however few switches offer inherent response to red/near infra-red light. Previous works have described the use of intermolecular interactions as a method to redshift the activation wavelength of photoswitches and to improve thermal half-life, however these systems are limited in their application due to the inherent bimolecularity of this strategy preventing its use in dilute or complex environments. Herein, we describe the use of topologically constrained supramolecular interactions to improve the switching properties of an indigo photoswitch within a [2]-rotaxane. This enabled photoswitching with near-IR (730 nm) light, as well as a 100-fold increase in thermal half-life and double the population of the metastable state under constant irradiation. This surpasses previous attempts at using supramolecular interactions to increase the thermal half-life by &gt;10-fold. This novel strategy towards the redshifting and fine-tuning of these molecular photoswitches has implications for the design of molecular machines and applied switching technologies. We anticipate that our insights into the design of such molecules will unlock new applications for mechanically interlocked molecules.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Preprint identifies conserved “hidden stop codons” as mRNA surveillance elements that terminate out-of-frame translation caused by frameshifting and promote NMD-mediated decay in fungi and human cells, linking codon usage to mRNA stability.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In eukaryotes, the mRNA stability is generally shaped by codon usage bias, the uneven preferences for synonymous codons, in a translation-dependent manner. However, the conserved mechanism linking codon to mRNA decay remains elusive. Hidden stop codons (HSCs), defined as stop codons located in the +1 or -1 frame relative to canonical ORF, are widespread across all genomes but largely uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that in both fungi and human cells, HSCs play an conserved and mechanistic role in promoting mRNA decay by rapidly terminating out-of-frame translation promoted by nonoptimal codons, primarily through +1 ribosomal frameshifting. In the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa, partially deleting HSCs via synonymous substitutions in the clock gene frequency increases mRNA stability and disrupts circadian rhythmicity. In human cells, acute depletion of translation termination factor eRF1 impairs recognition of HSCs, leading to global stabilization of mRNAs enriched in nonoptimal codons and HSCs. In both Neurospora and humans, these mRNAs are in part degraded through the NMD pathway via UPF1. Collectively, these findings suggest that in eukaryotes, HSCs serve as surveillance elements to monitor ribosomal frameshifting and out-of-translation promoted by nonoptimal codons, thereby initiating mRNA decay through NMD.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Author(s): Camille Porceillon, Aurélien Gay, Alfredo Taboada, and Valérie Vidal Fluid ascent through multilayered sediments takes place in many geophysical and industrial processes. In this paper, the authors perform experiments in a two-layer granular column consisting of coarse grains at the bottom and fine grains at the top, in which water is injected from below at a constant flow rate. They report the formation of a regular fluidization pattern at the two-layer interface in the form of dust chimneys, and propose a mechanism based on pressure-drop estimates to predict the wavelength of the fluidization pattern. #AdvancingField #WellStructured #ClearMotivation [Phys.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Computational catalysis study proposing a self-consistent DFT+U correction that fixes CO adsorption site/energy errors across transition-metal surfaces, with only indirect relevance to Origins-of-Life via improved modeling of surface-mediated chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Reliable calculation of adsorbate binding is central to understand catalysts using simulations as errors propagate to phase diagrams, microkinetic models, and catalyst design predictions. The most well-known reliability issue is the “CO puzzle” as standard density functional theory (DFT) often predicts the wrong adsorption site and overbinds CO on transition-metal surfaces that affect modeling CO oxidation, water-gas shift, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, and methanol synthesis among others. Here we show that a simple, self-consistent DFT+U scheme applied to the C and O p orbitals provides a practical route to resolve the CO puzzle. We find that a single DFT+U fit generally restores the experimental site preference, vibrational frequency, and adsorption energies within ±0.1 eV across Ag(111), Au(111), Co(0001), Cu(111), Ir(111), Pd(111), Pt(111), Ni(111), Rh(111), and Ru(0001) surfaces for several exchange-correlation functionals, with revPBE-D3(0)+U agreeing best with experiments. In addition, the same DFT+U fit allows to correct the O₂ gas-phase atomization energy, another great challenge in catalyst modeling. Partial density of states analysis confirms that the +U correction moves the 2π* orbital levels of CO favorably toward experimental photoemission measurements providing a physical motivation why the correction works in general. DFT+U is an ideal solution to retain a fully variational and geometry-optimizable framework that can be deployed easily to study CO binding to transition metal surfaces in established computational workflows.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This preprint characterizes Ift43 as an IFT-A subunit that regulates ciliary Gli2/Gli3 levels and Hedgehog signaling in mice, advancing developmental cell biology but offering minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research beyond a general evolutionary context.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Intraflagellar transport (IFT) drives the bidirectional movement of trains composed of IFT-A, IFT-B, and BBSome complexes that build and maintain cilia while supporting their signaling functions. Over evolution, IFT became integral to Hedgehog signaling by directing the dynamic movements of receptors and Gli transcription factors that fine-tune pathway output. The IFT-A complex contains six subunits, but the smallest, Ift43, remains poorly characterized and is absent from many ciliated species, suggesting specialized roles in signaling rather than core ciliogenesis. Here we show that loss of Ift43 in mice causes mid-gestation lethality with severe craniofacial defects, exencephaly, abdominal wall defects with exposed viscera, edema, and limb patterning defects. At the cellular level, Ift43 deficiency reduces both the number and length of cilia and blocks induction of Gli1 following pathway activation by the agonist SAG. Although Smoothened relocalizes to cilia normally, Ift43 mutants abnormally accumulate Gli2 and Gli3 at ciliary tips before stimulation and continue to generate repressor forms after activation. Conversely, Ift43 overexpression increases basal Gli2 cleavage, revealing an unanticipated role for Ift43 in regulating Gli processing. Together, these findings identify Ift43 as a key IFT-A component that links ciliary assembly to Hedgehog signal transduction and helps set the balance between Gli activator and repressor forms.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Reports a mechanically interlocked indigo [2]-rotaxane whose topologically constrained supramolecular interactions enable near-IR (730 nm) photoswitching and greatly extend thermal half-life, offering broadly relevant chemical control tools but limited direct Origins-of-Life relevance.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Photoswitches provide the opportunity to remotely and precisely control matter on the nanoscopic scale. For many materials and biological applications, photoswitches with long wavelength response are essential, however few switches offer inherent response to red/near infra-red light. Previous works have described the use of intermolecular interactions as a method to redshift the activation wavelength of photoswitches and to improve thermal half-life, however these systems are limited in their application due to the inherent bimolecularity of this strategy preventing its use in dilute or complex environments. Herein, we describe the use of topologically constrained supramolecular interactions to improve the switching properties of an indigo photoswitch within a [2]-rotaxane. This enabled photoswitching with near-IR (730 nm) light, as well as a 100-fold increase in thermal half-life and double the population of the metastable state under constant irradiation. This surpasses previous attempts at using supramolecular interactions to increase the thermal half-life by &gt;10-fold. This novel strategy towards the redshifting and fine-tuning of these molecular photoswitches has implications for the design of molecular machines and applied switching technologies. We anticipate that our insights into the design of such molecules will unlock new applications for mechanically interlocked molecules.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Biomedical study showing RasGRP1-selective DAG-indololactones induce P-TEFb via MEK–ERK–mTORC1 to synergistically reverse HIV latency with reduced T-cell activation and minimal CD4 downregulation.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Reactivation of latent HIV to facilitate clearance of persisting infected cells requires identifying non-toxic latency-reversing agents (LRAs) that activate P-TEFb, a cellular transcription factor essential for efficient HIV RNA synthesis. Diacylglycerol (DAG)-mimicking PKC agonists induce P-TEFb to reverse HIV latency mainly through a PKC-independent RasGRP1-Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK1/2 pathway, but also elicit global T-cell activation and a drastic downregulation of CD4 receptors. Here, we demonstrate that synthetic DAG-indololactones, which preferentially bind RasGRP1 over PKC by up to 60-fold, strongly induce posttranscriptional P-TEFb expression in memory CD4+ T cells via MEK-ERK1/2-mTORC1 signaling without triggering T-cell activation markers and with minimal CD4 loss. Elevation of T-cell activation markers by natural and synthetic PKC agonists proceeds through MEK-ERK1/2 but is independent of mTORC1 activity. Combinations of the DAG-indololactone 2A127 and HDAC inhibitors synergistically reactivate latent HIV in a primary T-cell model and CD4+ T cells from treated individuals. These findings suggest that a combination LRA approach targeting P-TEFb production through RasGRP1-ERK1/2-mTORC1 signaling and the epigenetic activation of proviral HIV can efficiently and safely reverse HIV latency.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Uses vision transformers on breast cancer histopathology and RPPA proteomics to regress apoptosis-pathway protein expression, finding cell-level models outperform patch-level models but with no direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Protein expression within oncogenic or suppresive pathways is hallmark indicator of oncogenesis. While traditional AI models in digital pathology attempt to predict singular proteins, there is a need to predict the downstream expression of proteins to indicate the propagation of signals. RNA-expression provides novel information, but does not provide information about the propagation of protein signals downstream and whether those signals are functional. Using Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) data with Whole Slide Images (WSIs) from the publicly available Cancer Genome Atlas&#x27; Breast Adenocarcinoma dataset (TCGA-BRCA), we predict the expression of five key proteins identified from the Apoptosis cascade using DNA Damage and Repair Cascades (DDR) as a biological control. Furthermore, we examine the performance of patch level Vision Transformers (ViT) on the regression task, which was tested against the designed Cellular-Level ViT CellRPPA. Our results demonstrate that patch-level vision transformers were unable to obtain statistically significant predictive results, obtaining R squared &lt; 0.1 for all folds. In addition, the CellViT obtained an R squared &gt; .1 in all 5 test folds. We also show that morphologically indicative cascades such as the apoptosis cascade provide signficantly higher performance over the DDR cascade.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study uses transcriptomics of gamma-irradiated thyroid organoids to show IFN-β signaling modulates apoptosis and reduces stem/progenitor regenerative capacity after radiation damage, but it is not directly relevant to origins-of-life or astrobiology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Background and Aim: Radiotherapy is a standard cancer treatment, but radiation exposure to surrounding healthy tissues may lead to adverse side effects that compromise patient quality of life. In patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy, thyroid damage is a frequent complication, resulting in hypothyroidism or secondary thyroid malignancies. Although clinically recognized, the molecular mechanisms underlying these side effects remain mostly unexplored. This study aims to characterize the radiation-induced molecular alterations in thyroid organoids. Methods: Bulk RNA sequencing was performed to investigate transcriptomic changes in tissue-derived thyroid organoids following gamma-irradiation. Observed changes were further validated and explored using qPCRs, western blotting, immunofluorescence, caspase 3/7 activity and organoid forming efficiency. Results: Our findings identify interferon-{beta} (IFN-{beta}) signaling as a key mediator of radiation-induced inflammation in the thyroid. Additionally, the intrinsic apoptotic pathway was found to be the predominant mechanism of radiation-induced thyroid cell death. Notably, while IFN-{beta} exhibited a protective effect against apoptosis, it concurrently reduced thyroid stem progenitor cell potential. Conclusions: These results highlight the dual role of IFN-{beta} signaling in modulating thyroid cell fate after irradiation, potentially promoting survival upon injury at the expense of regenerative potential.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nanopore sequencing underpins bacterial genomics and epigenomics, with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) leading. We benchmarked BGI&#x27;s CycloneSEQ against ONT using matched whole-genome shotgun (WGS) and methylation-free whole-genome amplification (WGA) libraries across six bacteria. With the updated CycloneSEQ kit/basecaller, reads reached 96.0% accuracy (mode 97.7%), within 0.8% of ONT R10.4.1; homopolymer performance surpassed R9.4.1 and approached R10.4.1. Error spectra were shared across platforms and dominated by A and G substitutions, WGA controls implicated methylation as a major contributor. At 50-fold coverage plus short-read polishing, CycloneSEQ assemblies achieved around 100% completeness with ~1 indel per 100 Kbp. For epigenomics, strand-specific basecalling errors enabled de novo discovery of 12 methylation motifs, and we introduce two CycloneSEQ-compatible signal-to-reference alignment strategies that permit signal comparison-based methylation detection. Beyond a single instrument, these results argue for a unified, cross-platform nanopore toolchain in which models, formats, and workflows interoperate from raw signal to accurate assemblies and methylomes.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Analytical theory predicts when resident populations can avoid extinction via evolutionary rescue during antagonistic invasions, showing that invader victim specificity and lower resident birth rates (especially via birth-limiting competition) can increase mutant establishment and rescue probability.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> From invasive predators displacing wildlife to medically deployed bacteriophages eliminating pathogens, biological invasions by antagonists are a fundamental driver of extinction, with implications for both conservation and medicine. Resident populations facing such invasions can sometimes avoid extinction through adaptation, a process known as evolutionary rescue. Here, an analytical approximation is derived for the probability of evolutionary rescue from antagonistic invaders, focusing on how rescue depends on a key antagonist trait--victim specificity. Rescue is shown to be most likely either when invaders are slow-spreading, resident-dependent specialists whose failure to encounter suitable victims buys time for mutation, or when invaders are fast-spreading generalists that rapidly relieve standing genetic variation of intraspecific competition. The central result is that, whether invaders are generalists or specialists, a lower resident birth rate can facilitate rescue relative to a higher one by reducing the effect of demographic stochasticity on mutant establishment. If the lower birth rate is density-independent, it primarily promotes rescue from generalists, whereas if it arises from birth-limiting competition it can also appreciably aid rescue from specialists. Overall, the results suggest that invader victim specificity can reshape evolutionary rescue by dynamically coupling the rate of resident decline to the growth rate of the stressor driving the decline, with resident life history mediating the outcome.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Genome-wide phylogenetic discordance analyses in AA-genome wild rice support ancient introgression between deeply divergent, geographically separated lineages, illustrating how reticulate evolution can shape modern genomes.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Phylogenetic incongruence is increasingly recognized as pervasive, yet the extent to which reticulate evolution occurs between groups separated by substantial geographical distances and deep phylogenetic divergence remains poorly characterized. In the Oryza AA-genome group--a model for plant speciation and domestication--the traditional bifurcation model posits that Australian Oryza meridionalis and African Oryza longistaminata occupy basal branches, distinct from the more recently diversified monophyletic clade comprising Asian and other African lineages, including major cultivars. However, recent evidence from endogenous viral sequences has hinted at unexpected genetic relatedness between African O. longistaminata and Asian Oryza sativa, which are geographically and phylogenetically distant. Here, we conducted a genome-wide survey across 11 Oryza species to systematically identify genomic regions exhibiting phylogenetic incongruence. Widespread phylogenetic discordance was observed, notably involving genomic segments in which O. longistaminata showed phylogenetic proximity to Asian species, contradicting their established deep divergence. To distinguish between introgression and incomplete lineage sorting, we performed four-taxon ABBA-BABA tests, which provided statistical support for introgression. Furthermore, divergence time estimates for these incongruent regions were younger than the species divergence times, suggesting historical introgression between the ancestors of lineages that are currently separated by vast geographical distances. Systematic assessments indicated that potential analytical artifacts, such as compositional bias and substitution saturation, were unlikely to explain the observations. These convergent lines of evidence suggest that ancient introgression had occurred between currently geographically separated and evolutionarily divergent Oryza lineages, leaving detectable footprints across their modern genomes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recruitment dynamics, or the distribution of the number of offspring among individuals, is central for understanding ecology and evolution. Sweepstakes reproduction (heavy right-tailed offspring number distribution) is central for understanding the ecology and evolution of highly fecund natural populations. Sweepstakes reproduction can induce jumps in type frequencies and multiple mergers in gene genealogies of sampled gene copies. We take sweepstakes reproduction to be skewed offspring number distribution due to mechanisms not involving natural selection, such as in chance matching of broadcast spawning with favourable environmental conditions. Here, we consider population genetic models of sweepstakes reproduction in a diploid panmictic populations absent selfing and evolving in a random environment. Our main results are (i) continuous-time Beta and Poisson-Dirichlet coalescents, when combining the results the skewness parameter of the Beta-coalescent ranges from 0 to 2, and the Beta-coalescents may be incomplete due to an upper bound on the number of potential offspring produced by any pair of parents; (ii) in large populations time is measured in units proportional to either N/ log N or N generations (where 2N is the population size when constant); (iii) it follows that incorporating population size changes leads to time-changed coalescents with the time-change independent of (iv) using simulations we show that the ancestral process is not well approximated by the corresponding coalescent (as measured through certain functionals of the processes); (v) whenever the skewness of the offspring number distribution is increased the conditional (conditioned on the population ancestry) and the unconditional ancestral processes are not in good agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Data-driven approaches offer great potential for accelerating ab initio electronic structure calculations of molecules and materials but their transferability is often limited due to the vast amount of data needed for training, including when addressing the need to fine-tune universal models for each specific system to be studied. Here, we demonstrate how contributions from system-specific electronic structure machine learning (ESML) models may be combined (“stitched”) to deliver density matrices of entire systems of interest, improving the initial guess for the self-consistent field cycle and delivering gains in computational efficiency. The “stitching” of density matrices is demonstrated for sequential calculations, such as geometry optimization and molecular dynamics, and we show that the synergistic use of ESML models and density matrix extrapolation algorithms can accelerate standard computational calculations. The algorithms are demonstrated for test cases relating to water clusters and a methane clathrate cage, with the benefits discussed. The future opportunities for hybrid quantum mechanical and ML (QM/ML), and also ML/ML paradigms, are broad-ranging with significant computational speed-up attainable.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Seals (pinnipeds) are the only mammals that can hear in both air and water. How and when they achieved the ability to negotiate such contrasting auditory media remains unknown. Here, we apply 3D shape and phylogenetic comparative analyses to a large dataset of caniform carnivorans (119 species, 217 specimens) to study the emergence of amphibious hearing in pinnipeds despite significant evolutionary constraints. We find support for the cavernous tissue as a functional and evolutionary mechanism for amphibious hearing. This tissue, which fills with blood during diving to equalise air pressure in the ear, enables a shift from in-air to underwater hearing by matching the acoustic impedance of the ear to that of the surrounding water. Early diverging freshwater pinnipeds had impaired hearing underwater. The first marine pinnipeds could hear amphibiously but were limited by a functional tradeoff between hearing abilities and the need to prevent damage from loud underwater sounds. Subsequently, otariids (eared seals) and phocids (true seals) independently acquired middle ear adaptations that expanded their underwater hearing range. This iterative evolution likely facilitated the exploration of novel auditory adaptive zones by crown pinnipeds, resulting in rare acoustic abilities like ultrasonic singing, vocal learning, and keeping rhythm.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding how the embryonic environment affects adult phenotype is critical in the context of both human health and the increasing variance of environmental conditions due to climate change. Here we consider this topic within the framework of phenotypic integration, i.e., the pattern of correlations among elements of functionally robust trait suites. We investigated the life-long consequences of alternative embryonic environments on phenotypic integration in the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum). We exposed live-bearing pea aphid mothers to an adverse, high-density environment or a benign, low-density environment and measured morphological traits, fecundity, and transcriptional profiles in the resulting winged and wingless adult offspring. We observe that morphological integration decreases in both morphs in response to the adverse maternal environment. Transcriptional integration, on the other hand, shows a morph-specific response: integration increases in wingless offspring but decreases in winged offspring in response to the adverse maternal environment. Our results show the remarkable phenotypic diversity that a single genotype can express in response to environmental variation; that maternal environmental conditions can have strong effects on offspring trait variation and trait integration; and that these effects differ at the morphological and transcriptional levels.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Transcriptional pause-release critically regulates cellular RNA biogenesis, yet how dysregulation of this process impacts embryonic development is not fully understood. Rtf1 is a multifunctional transcription regulatory protein involved in modulating promoter-proximal pausing of RNA Polymerase II (RNA Pol II). Using zebrafish and mouse as model systems, we show that Rtf1 activity is essential for the differentiation of the myocardial lineage from mesoderm. Ablation of rtf1 impairs the formation of nkx2.5+ / tbx5a+ cardiac progenitor cells, resulting in the development of embryos without cardiomyocytes. Structure-function analysis demonstrates that Rtf1’s cardiogenic activity requires its Plus3 domain, which confers interaction with the pausing/elongation factor Spt5. In Rtf1-deficient embryos, the occupancy of RNA Pol II at transcription start sites was reduced relative to downstream occupancy, suggesting a reduction in transcriptional pausing. Intriguingly, attenuating pause release by pharmacological inhibition or morpholino targeting of CDK9 improved RNA Pol II occupancy at the transcription start sites of key cardiac genes and restored cardiomyocytes in Rtf1-deficient embryos. Thus, our findings demonstrate the crucial role that Rtf1-mediated transcriptional pausing plays in controlling the precise spatiotemporal transcription programs that govern early heart development.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The nucleosome acidic patch is a hub of coordinated engagement by proteins that regulate genomic function. Here we report that S. cerevisiae Dot5 contains an arginine-rich HMGN-like motif that mediates nucleosome acidic patch binding and is required for the cell growth, DNA repair and heterochromatin defects exhibited when the protein is overexpressed. The heterologous expression of camelid single chain antibodies to the nucleosome acidic patch confers a similar range of phenotypes, with the most severe observed when an &#x27;arginine-anchor&#x27; mode of binding analogous to many endogenous factors is employed. This highlights a delicate balance between nucleosome acidic patch interactors critical for normal cellular functions and dysregulated in disease.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Benchmarks single-cell and bulk RNA-seq deconvolution accuracy in human bronchoalveolar lavage samples, identifying systematic pseudo-bulk vs real-bulk gene discrepancies and advocating small protocol-matched in-study references.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Background: Pseudo-bulk RNA-seq, generated by aggregating single-cell profiles, is widely used for benchmarking deconvolution methods because it globally approximates bulk transcriptomes and provides known cell-type proportions as ground truth. However, pseudo-bulk inherits single-cell specific measurement properties, and the extent to which these differ from real bulk RNA-seq remains difficult to quantify in the absence of paired data. In practice, deconvolution studies also commonly rely on large external single-cell references, yet the value of small, protocol-matched in-study references has not been systematically evaluated under real bulk conditions. These gaps motivate a paired benchmark that jointly examines pseudo-bulk fidelity, reference design, and their consequences for deconvolution accuracy. Results: We establish a fully paired benchmarking framework using split-sample, donor-matched bulk and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) from human bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Embedded within a reverse five-fold cross-validation design and evaluated on real bulk RNA-seq data, this framework benchmarks 15 deconvolution algorithms published in 2013-2025 across 3 cell-type resolutions and 5 single-cell references, including three published BAL datasets, a harmonized lung BAL atlas, and an in-study reference derived from paired aliquots. We show that real bulk and matched pseudo-bulk profiles exhibit systematic gene-level differences, identifying 557 reproducibly discordant genes (|log2 FC|&gt;1, FDR&lt;0.05 by LIMMA), including cell-type informative features. These discrepancies reflect technology-specific effects and violate the linear mixing assumption underlying most deconvolution methods. We demonstrate that a protocol-matched in-study reference constructed from only six donors consistently outperforms substantially larger external references, with the advantage that increases at finer cell-type resolution. Moreover, paired samples enable the identification and selective removal of discordant genes, which further improves deconvolution accuracy for many algorithms, particularly in high-resolution settings. These findings are robust across methods, references, and evaluation criteria and extend beyond compositional accuracy to improving recovery of disease-associated cell-type differences in clinical applications. Conclusions: Our study provides the first fully paired benchmark of transcriptomic deconvolution on real bulk RNA-seq data of human BAL samples and demonstrates that reference design and data compatibility are as influential as algorithm choice. Beyond benchmarking, we introduce a practical and cost-effective protocol for deconvolution studies: generate single-cell data for a minimal subset of bulk samples (pilot pairing), use these data to construct an in-study reference and identify discordant genes, and apply the resulting insights to the full cohort. This strategy requires limited additional experimental effort yet yields substantial gains in accuracy and stability, offering actionable guidance for future bulk RNA-seq deconvolution studies across tissues and platforms.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Bacterial aryl malonate decarboxylase is a cofactor-free enzyme that generates a wide spectrum of alpha-chiral carboxylic acids in outstanding optical purity, including several non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and chiral building blocks. The well-characterized AMDase from Bordetella bronchiseptica (BbAMDase) and related enzymes of the same family have three main limitations: (i) low stability, both operational and thermal, and (ii) limited substrate spectrum regarding the size of the smaller substituent on the alpha-C-atom and (iii) low stereoselectivity towards alpha-alkenyl-alpha-alkyl malonic acids. To address these limitations, we expanded the structural diversity of the AMDase family by ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR). The phylogenetic analysis of the decarboxylase revealed conserved structural motifs and key amino acids in the hydrophobic active-site cavity, a catalytic motif crucial for activity and selectivity of the enzyme. The analysis highlighted the natural distribution of amino acid exchanges that had been previously identified in enzyme engineering campaigns. AMDase ancestors showed higher stability, activity, and, in one case, also stereoselectivity than BbAMDase. While the up to 10 {degrees} C higher unfolding temperature of AMDase ancestors is a frequent result in ASR, the improvement of the half-life time of 294-fold of ancestor N131 was surprising. Ancestor N31 formed 2-methyl-but-3-enoic acid from its corresponding malonic acid in an optical purity of 99.7% eeR. The extant BbAMDase produces this compound in much lower optical purity (96.8% eeR), which corresponds to a 1.4 kcal*mol-1 higher difference of the transition state free energy of the two reaction paths leading to the different enantiomers. Furthermore, the stereoselectivity of the ancestors was completely inverted by switch of the catalytic cysteine residues G74C/C188G.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> 2D radiation-hydrodynamical simulations suggest photoevaporation alone cannot maintain clean gaps in protoplanetary discs, instead producing a persistent partial depletion that may still create dust-trapping pressure bumps and transition-disc-like signatures.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08938v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We investigate whether photoevaporation alone can open and sustain gaps in protoplanetary discs by coupling the evolving disc structure with the photoevaporative flow in two dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations. Our results show that once a density depression forms, the local mass-loss rate decreases sharply, suppressing further gap deepening. Viscous inflow and radial mass transport along the disc surface act to partially refill the depleted region, preventing complete clearing. The resulting configuration is a persistent, partially depleted zone whose evolution is largely insensitive to the initial disc morphology. This behaviour challenges the standard paradigm that photoevaporation efficiently carves clean inner cavities and directly produces transition discs. However, the pressure maximum at the outer edge of the depression may still trap dust grains, giving rise to transition disc like observational signatures. We also present a first-order prescription to approximate this behaviour in one dimensional disc evolution models, suitable for use in planet formation and population synthesis studies. Although the prescription improves upon static mass-loss treatments, it remains approximate, underscoring the need for further multidimensional simulations and parameter-space exploration to derive robust recipes for global disc and planet population models.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.09070v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent ALMA observations with 0&#x27;&#x27;.1 resolution reveal characteristic substructures in circumstellar disks around young Class I sources, providing clues to the early stages of morphological disk evolution. In this paper, we applied PRIISM imaging to ALMA archival Band 6 continuum data of the circumstellar disk around the Class I protostar CrA IRS 2, located in the Corona Australis molecular cloud, which is associated with an extended gas ring attributed to magnetic flux advection driven by interchange instability. The dust continuum image with 1.5 times higher spatial resolution than conventional imaging revealed, for the first time, the early-phase circumstellar disk with both inner central hole and outer ring-gap structures, making CrA IRS 2 the youngest system exhibiting such features based on the bolometric temperature of $T_{\rm bol}$=235 K. To examine planet-disk interaction as one possible origin of the outer ring-gap structure, we found the measured depth and width to be consistent with planet-disk interaction models, suggesting the existence of a giant planet with a mass of 0.1-1.8 $M_{\rm Jup}$. The additional mechanism required for rapid planet formation could be the magnetic flux dissipation driven by the interchange instability, which suppresses MRI-driven turbulence and extends the dead zone, allowing efficient dust growth and the early formation of planets. This system thus provides new insight into how substructures and planet formation can emerge during the early, accreting phase of disk evolution.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.13028v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: In this work, we study a space-time modulated electro-mechanical system, consisting of an array of coupled cantilevers with their on-site potential provided by electromagnets driven by AC currents. Model equations are derived, and the effect of the modulation on the dispersion bands is examined. The theory of breather existence and stability is extended to include space-time modulation. We perform numerical simulations in a time-modulated system, showing three types of breather response depending on the driving frequency: (i) the modulation frequency is an integer multiple of the breather frequency or, in other words, this phenomenon corresponds to period doubling, tripling, etc.; (ii) the opposite, that is, the breather frequency is an integer multiple of the modulation frequency, corresponding to period-halving, etc. (iii) the breather and modulation frequencies are commensurate in a different form. We use for all of them the term {\em Floquet breathers} in analogy with Floquet solitons in photonic systems. As there is no dissipation, but periodic forcing, the energy is conserved but only at discrete times. There exists in this system a huge variety of breathers, either site-centered, symmetric and antisymmetric, bond centered, in-phase or in-quadrature with the modulation, and we analyze the evolution of stability of some of them as a function of the modulation frequency. The construction of a similar system would be of interest to study the properties of dynamic metamaterials.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.09639v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) are among the most primitive remnants of the early Solar System, and constraining their sizes, shapes, albedos, and surface properties is essential for understanding their origin and evolution. Stellar occultations provide highly accurate size and shape measurements for TNOs, while photometry constrains their albedo and surface colours. (28978) Ixion is one of the largest TNOs and a prominent Plutino, making it a key target for comparative studies. We aim to constrain Ixion&#x27;s projected size, shape, absolute magnitude, geometric albedo, and surface colours, and to search for evidence of an atmosphere or circum-object material. We analysed stellar occultation campaigns by Ixion conducted between 2020 and 2023 within the Lucky Star collaboration, comprising 51 observations from eight events, including 30 positive detections. Five multi-chord events enabled a global limb fit and an accurate reconstruction of Ixion&#x27;s projected shape. The occultations reveal a slightly elongated limb well represented by a single projected ellipse, yielding an area-equivalent diameter of $D_{\mathrm{equiv}} = 696.78^{+10.75}_{-8.87}$ km and an apparent oblateness $\epsilon&#x27; = 0.081^{+0.004}_{-0.010}$. Typical radial residuals of order $\sim$10 km indicate a largely stable shape across epochs, with modest epoch-dependent variations. Calibrated photometric data yield an absolute magnitude of $H_V = 3.845 \pm 0.006$, a phase-curve slope of $\beta = 0.1301 \pm 0.0078$ mag deg$^{-1}$, and a visible geometric albedo of $p_V = 0.106^{+0.003}_{-0.003}$, with colours consistent with moderately red TNO surfaces. No atmosphere or circum-object material is detected down to our sensitivity limits. The best-sampled event also allows a precise measurement of the angular diameter of the occulted star Gaia DR3 4056440205544338944, $\theta_\star = 0.670 \pm 0.010$ mas.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Models how pebble accretion onto growing terrestrial protoplanets can drive open-nebula loss of moderately volatile elements (e.g., Zn/Na/K), offering a plausible pathway to Earth-like depletion trends via late-stage merging of a ~0.7 Earth-mass depleted body with less-depleted impactors.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08958v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Protoplanets growing by pebble accretion capture massive hydrogen-helium atmospheres from the surrounding nebula. Pebbles settling through such atmospheres continuously release gravitational potential energy, heating both the atmosphere and the pebbles. Under these conditions, atmosphere temperatures above large protoplanets are sufficiently high to melt silicate pebbles, support long-lived magma oceans, and drive evaporation of volatile species. Because these atmospheres are open to the nebula, some amount of volatile loss is inevitable. Here we analyze the depletion of moderately volatile elements from terrestrial protoplanets undergoing pebble accretion. We consider chondrule-size silicate pebbles enriched in Si, Na, K, and Zn relative to Earth, settling through a hydrogen-helium-rich atmosphere containing these same volatiles. We show that volatile depletion depends critically on protoplanet mass, the timescale of atmosphere exhaust, and the pebble composition. The protoplanetary mass effect is especially strong. For exhaust timescales of a few centuries, we find that substantial depletion of Zn begins around 0.4 Earth mass, and for Na and K around 0.6 Earth mass, with negligible depletion of these elements at smaller masses. Using a pebble composition that matches Earth&#x27;s major element abundances, broad agreement with Earth&#x27;s depletion trend for moderately volatile elements is found by merging a large (approximately 0.7 Earth mass) volatile-depleted target protoplanet with one or more smaller, less-depleted impactors.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.09330v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We present an updated characterization of the planetary system orbiting the nearby M2 dwarf GJ 3090 (TOI-177; $d = 22$ pc), based on new high-precision radial velocity (RV) observations from NIRPS and HARPS. With an orbital period of 2.85 d, the transiting sub-Neptune GJ 3090 b has a mass we refine to $4.52 \pm 0.47 M_{\oplus}$, which, combined with our derived radius of $2.18 \pm 0.06 R_{\oplus}$, yields a density of $2.40^{+0.33}_{-0.30}$ g cm$^{-3}$. The combined interior structure and atmospheric constraints indicate that GJ 3090 b is a compelling water-world candidate, with a volatile-rich envelope in which water likely represents a significant fraction. We also confirm the presence of a second planet, GJ 3090 c, a sub-Neptune with a 15.9 d orbit and a minimum mass of $10.0 \pm 1.3 M_{\oplus}$, which does not transit. Despite its proximity to the star&#x27;s 18 d rotation period, our joint analysis using a multidimensional Gaussian process (GP) model that incorporates TESS photometry and differential stellar temperature measurements distinguishes this planetary signal from activity-induced variability. In addition, we place new constraints on a non-transiting planet candidate with a period of 12.7 d, suggested in earlier RV analyses. This candidate remains a compelling target for future monitoring. These results highlight the crucial role of multidimensional GP modelling in disentangling planetary signals from stellar activity, enabling the detection of a planet near the stellar rotation period that could have remained undetected with traditional approaches.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08952v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Various problems of the formation and evolution of planetary systems are studied. Most of the studies are devoted to the Solar System. The collapse of the presolar cloud and the accumulation of planets are studied. The author considers the formation of the Earth-Moon system, binary trans-Neptunian objects, and the axial rotations of planets. He discusses the formation of asteroid and trans-Neptunian belts, including the evolution of resonant asteroid orbits and the formation of the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt. The book discusses the migration of bodies during the formation of the Solar System and at present, including a discussion of the delivery of icy bodies from beyond the ice line to the terrestrial planets and the formation of craters on the Moon. The Deep Impact mission is discussed; during this mission the impact module of the spacecraft collided with the comet Tempel 1. The book studies the migration of dust in the Solar System and the formation of the zodiacal belt, as well as the migration of bodies and dust particles ejected from the terrestrial planets and the Moon. The author considers the migration of bodies in some exoplanetary systems (Proxima Centauri, Trappist 1, and Gliese 581), the spectra of Earth-like exoplanets with different rotation periods, as well as the efficiency of exoplanet searches using microlensing observations with various telescopes.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.09492v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Understanding the demographics of close-in planets is crucial for insights into exoplanet formation and evolution. We present a detailed analysis of occurrence rates for close-in (0.5-16 day) planets with radii between 2 and 20$\,R_{\oplus}$ around FGK main-sequence stars. Our study uses a comprehensive sample from four years of TESS Science Processing Operations Center full-frame image data cross-matched with Gaia, analysed through our rigorous detection, vetting, and validation pipeline. Using high-confidence planet candidates, we apply a hierarchical Bayesian model to determine occurrence rates in the two-dimensional orbital period-radius plane. Our results are presented using 10-by-10 bins across the period-radius parameter space, offering unprecedented resolution and statistical precision. We find an overall occurrence rate of $9.4^{+0.7}_{-0.6}\%$. When using identical binning, our occurrence rate posteriors distributions align with Kepler&#x27;s but have a magnitude smaller uncertainties on average. For hot Jupiters, we estimate the overall occurrence rate of $0.39^{+0.03}_{-0.02}\%$. This value is consistent with the previous Kepler FGK-type result within $1\sigma$. We find an overall occurrence rate of Neptunian desert planets of $0.08\pm0.01\%$, to our knowledge the first such determination. Additionally, in a volume-limited Gaia subsample within 100 pc in the same parameter region, we measure an overall planet occurrence rate of $15.4^{+1.6}_{-1.5}\%$ and a hot Jupiter occurrence rate of $0.42^{+0.16}_{-0.12}\%$. Our results establishes an improved foundation for constraining theoretical models of exoplanet populations.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.09438v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The young TOI-451 planetary system, aged 125 Myr, provides a unique opportunity to test theories of planetary internal structures and atmospheric mass loss through examination of its three transiting planets. We present an exhaustive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up to determine the orbital and physical properties of the system. We perform multidimensional Gaussian Process regression with the code pyaneti on spectroscopic time-series and NGTS/LCO light curves to disentangle the stellar and planetary signal in ESPRESSO radial velocities. We show how contemporaneous photometry serves as an activity indicator to inform RV modelling within a multidimensional Gaussian Processes framework. We argue that this can be exploited when spectroscopic observations are adversely affected by low signal-to-noise and/or poor sampling. We estimate the Doppler semi-amplitudes of Kb = 2.6(+1.1,-1.2) m/s, Kc = 1.2(+1.0,-0.8) m/s and Kd = 2.7 +/- 1.2 m/s. This translates into 2-sigma mass estimates for TOI-451 b and d of Mb = 4.7(+2.1,-2.2) Earth masses and Md = 10.2(+4.6,-4.5) Earth masses, as well as a mass upper limit for TOI-451 c of Mc &lt; 11.5 Earth masses. The derived planetary properties suggest that planets c and d contain significant hydrogen-rich envelopes. The inferred parameters of TOI-451 b are consistent with either a rocky world that still retains a small hydrogen envelope or a water world. These insights make the TOI-451 system an ideal laboratory for future follow-up studies aimed at measuring atmospheric compositions, detecting atmospheric mass-loss signatures, and further exploring planetary formation and evolution processes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08923v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Asteroid Kamo`oalewa is the target of the Tianwen-2 sample-return mission by CNSA. Because of its orbit and its spectral properties, it was proposed that Kamo`oalewa originated from the Moon as impact ejecta, possibly from the Giordano Bruno crater. We aim at estimating the relative contribution of Kamo`oalewa-like objects originating from the general near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population which originated in the main asteroid belt, and compare it with the relative contribution of Giordano Bruno ejecta. We first estimate the average fraction of quasi-satellite orbits at any given time. By using recently developed NEA population models, we extract the expected number of Earth co-orbitals of the same size of Kamo`oalewa, and then get an estimate of the average number of Kamo`oalewa-like objects using the fraction computed before. Similarly, we obtain an estimate for the number of Kamo`oalewa-like objects that may originate as ejecta from the Giordano Bruno impact. We also performed survey simulations to estimate their efficiency in the detection of Kamo`oalewa-like objects. We found that the main belt accounts for 1.23 \pm 0.13 Kamo`oalewa-like objects on average. The expected number of Kamo`oalewa-like objects originated as Giordano Bruno ejecta is 0.042, which is more than order of magnitude smaller. We found a discovery efficiency of Earth quasi-satellites between 95% and 70% for absolute magnitude between 22 and 25 for the Pan-STARRS survey, and population models show that this is in agreement with the known population. The Vera Rubin Observatory should reach an efficiency of 92% down to absolute magnitude 25. These estimates show that population models of NEAs are capable to account for Kamo`oalewa-like objects, thus supporting the hypothesis that that Kamo&#x27;oalewa originated from the main belt. This will be further investigated by the in-situ exploration of the Tianwen-2 mission.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2508.13269v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: This paper presents a new terrestrial planet formation theory demonstrating that Earth-mass planets form naturally in tandem protosolar disks. Our model builds upon tandem planet formation theory (Ebisuzaki and Imaeda 2017; Imaeda and Ebisuzaki 2017a,b, 2018), incorporating magneto-rotational instability (MRI) suppression (Balbus and Hawley 1991; Hawley and Balbus 1991), porous particle aggregation (Okuzumi et al. 2012; Kataoka et al. 2013), and standard planet formation mechanisms (e.g., Safronov 1969; Hayashi et al. 1985). In a tandem proto-solar disk, planets form at two distinct locations: the inner and outer edges of the MRI-suppressed region, where solid particles accumulate. The inner edge produces rocky planets, while the outer edge forms gas giants. When planetesimals reach Earth-sized mass at the inner MRI edge, they migrate outward due to gas disk torque. For a protosolar disk accretion rate of M_dot = 10^-7.08 solar masses per year (Case D), the total solid mass at the inner MRI edge reaches 1.99 Earth masses, producing two Earth-mass planets. This result closely matches the solar system&#x27;s terrestrial planet distribution (Earth and Venus), which comprises 92% of total terrestrial planet mass, providing strong support for our formation mechanism.</p>

At that stage, the key bottleneck will no longer be planet detection, but our ability to understand how planetary systems form, evolve, and diversify across different stellar and Galactic environments. To address this, we need a large-scale, high-resolution spectroscopic survey of planet-host stars, spanning a broad range of Galactic environments (thin and thick disks, bulge, halo, clusters, associations), and including a well-defined control sample of non-hosts. Such a survey must deliver homogeneous stellar parameters, detailed abundance determinations, ages, and kinematics for tens of thousands of hosts, extending to the faint magnitudes probed by future missions but are beyond the reach of existing and currently planned spectroscopic facilities.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08916v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The formation and early evolution of protoplanetary disks are governed by a wide variety of physical processes during a gravitational collapse. Observations have begun probing disks in their earliest stages, and have favored the magnetically-regulated disk formation scenario. Disks are also expected to exhibit ellipsoidal morphologies in the early phases, an aspect that has been widely overlooked. We aim to describe the birth and evolution of the disk while accounting for the eccentric motions of fluid parcels. Using 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with ambipolar diffusion, we self-consistently model the collapse of isolated $1~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $3~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ cores to form a central protostar surrounded by a disk. We account for dust dynamics, and employ gas tracer particles to follow the thermodynamical history of fluid parcels. We find that magnetic fields and turbulence drive highly anisotropic accretion onto the disk via dense streamers. This streamer-fed accretion, occurring from the vertical and radial directions, drives vigorous internal turbulence that facilitates efficient angular momentum transport and rapid radial spreading. Crucially, the anisotropic inflow delivers material with an angular momentum deficit that continuously generates and sustains significant disk eccentricity ($e\sim 0.1$). Our results reveal ubiquitous eccentric kinematics in Class 0 disks, with direct implications for disk evolution, planetesimal formation, and the interpretation of cosmochemical signatures in Solar System meteorites.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.07656v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Analytical models are essential for building physical intuition and guiding the interpretation of exoplanet observations by clarifying the dependencies that shape atmospheric signatures. We present a generalization of the classical isothermal, isobaric transmission model by allowing the opacity to vary with pressure as a power law, $\kappa \propto P^{n}$, and explicitly defining the reference opacity $\kappa_{0}$ at a chosen pressure $P_{0}$. By treating the slant optical depth as an Abel transform of the radial absorption coefficient, we derive a closed-form expression for the effective transit radius in a hydrostatic, isothermal atmosphere with pressure-dependent opacity. The solution provides a compact framework for exploring non-isobaric effects and explicitly links the vertical opacity gradient to observable spectral features. We benchmark the model against empirical transmission spectra of Earth and the hot Jupiter WASP-39b, finding a significantly improved fit relative to the isobaric formula. This generalized expression offers a physically interpretable foundation for analyzing high-precision spectra from JWST and upcoming ARIEL observations, and can serve as a basis for semi-analytical retrieval approaches optimized for computational efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2507.18283v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: A giant planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk excites spiral density waves, which steepen into shocks as they propagate away from the planet. These shocks lead to secular disk heating and gap opening, both of which can have important implications for the evolution of solids near the planet. To date, these two effects have largely been modeled independently. In this study, we present a self-consistent model that unifies these processes by linking shock heating and angular momentum deposition through the entropy jumps across the spiral shocks. We show that this model accurately reproduces the temperature and surface density profiles around the planet&#x27;s orbit, as obtained from two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with standard $\alpha$ viscosity and $\beta$ thermal relaxation prescriptions. Furthermore, by incorporating an empirically derived scaling law for the radial distribution of the entropy jump, we construct a fully analytic model that self-consistently predicts the temperature and surface density structures of disks hosting a giant planet. This work represents a first step toward understanding how a giant planet forming in the inner disk region influences the distribution and composition of second-generation planets and planetesimals in its vicinity.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This paper models Pluto–Charon tidal synchronisation via inward orbital migration (including temporary spin–orbit resonances and low tidal stress), offering planetary system evolution context but minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life processes.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.17832v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: It is usually taken for granted that mutual synchronisation of a tidal two body system is attained through tidal recession, assuming the reduced Hill sphere is not reached. However, synchronisation can be achieved also via tidal approach, provided the Roche limit is not crossed. For each of the two scenarios, we derive the condition under which the evolving synchronicity radius catches up with the tidally evolving orbit. We consider the two scenarios for the Pluto Charon system and examine the impact origin hypothesis of Charons formation against capture. Based on geophysical evidence, we propose that capture appears more likely. Motivated by this conclusion, we investigate the capture scenario, wherein the orbital evolution of Charon starts at a higher altitude than present and undergoes tidal descent, both analytically and numerically. We also consider the possibility that Plutos initial prograde spin underwent a reversal by a tidally approaching retrograde Charon. Depending on the initial conditions, we observe temporary locking of Charon into higher spin orbit resonances 3:2 to 7:2 during the first 0.5 Myr of the systems evolution. Owing to a greater initial separation between the partners, the power dissipated in each of them turns out to be much lower than in the case of tidal recession of bodies of the same internal structure. The greater initial separation also results in lower tidal stress, which may explain the absence of tidally generated fracture patterns.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08971v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Cryogenic photon sensing for high-energy physics motivates photosensor technologies that combine large-area scalability with internal gain and stable operation at low temperature. Amorphous selenium is a promising photoconductor, yet its field- and temperature-dependent transport and avalanche response in lateral geometries have not been systematically established. This work reports field-resolved photocurrent measurements of lateral a-Se devices from 93 K to 297 K under 401 nm excitation at fields up to 120 V/um. Below avalanche onset, the external quantum efficiency was described by the Onsager model, yielding effective post-thermalization separations that decrease with decreasing temperature. The field-assisted detrapping region was evaluated using several transport models, with the data favoring field-assisted hopping and thermally-assisted tunneling as the mechanisms that best capture the temperature evolution of the photocurrent. The boundaries between field-assisted detrapping, transport-limited conduction, and avalanche shift with temperature; at 93 K the response transitions directly from detrapping into avalanche. Avalanche multiplication was analyzed using the Lucky-drift model. These results provide the first systematic characterization of cryogenic avalanche behavior in lateral a-Se detectors and establish quantitative trends relevant to low-temperature, high-gain photodetector design.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2509.21452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Circumbinary planets (CBPs) provide a unique window into planet formation and dynamical evolution in complex gravitational environments. Their orbits are shaped not only by the protoplanetary disk but also by the perturbations from two stellar hosts, making them sensitive probes of both early- and late-stage dynamical processes. In this work, we investigate the unusual architecture of the VHS J125601.92-125723.9 system, where a retrograde, nearly polar tertiary orbits an extremely low-mass substellar binary in a hierarchical triple configuration. We find that triple body dynamics can naturally reproduce the observed high eccentricity of the inner binary and the tertiary&#x27;s near-polar obliquity. However, this configuration alone cannot account for the observed mutual inclination, which is both near-polar and retrograde. This tension suggests two possible formation pathways: either the planet formed in an aligned, protoplanetary disk-like configuration and was later tilted by an additional, undetected fourth companion (below current Gaia limits), or the system formed close to its current state. Stellar flybys, in contrast, are unlikely due to their long timescales. Our results highlight both the explanatory power and the limitations of triple dynamics, and the potential role of hidden companions in shaping extreme planetary architectures.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08883v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is the first NASA Astrophysics flagship mission with a key science goal of searching for signs of life on rocky habitable exoplanets beyond our solar system. The Living Worlds Community Working Group was charged with investigating how HWO could characterize planets orbiting stars in the solar neighborhood, search for signs of life, and interpret potential biosignatures within a false positive and false negative framework. The Surface Biosignatures Task assessed the measurement requirements and instrument needs to detect these biosignatures under an &#x27;Earth through time&#x27; scenario. Surface biosignatures are planetary-scale spectral features resulting from absorption and/or scattering of radiation by organisms containing photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic pigments. This secondary class of biosignature can be used to corroborate atmospheric biosignatures by providing multiple lines of evidence to aid in assessing their biogenicity. Furthermore, surface biopigments are the only way to detect more primitive forms of anoxygenic photosynthesis if oxygenic photosynthesis never evolved. Key Findings: To detect biopigments on the surface of planets under Archean, Proterozoic, and Modern atmospheric compositions (15 percent coverage, 50 percent cloud cover), an SNR of 20-40 would be needed over 500-1100 nm. However, there may be some cases in which lower SNR is required; studies are ongoing. Coronagraph requirements: (1) The detection of surface biosignatures would be greatly enhanced by having as many parallel coronagraph channels as possible across the entire wavelength range with no or minimal gaps between channels. (2) Retrieval studies revealed that restricted wavelength ranges (e.g., 0.4 - 0.7 microns), such as may be used during initial survey strategies, are not sufficient to deconvolve the biopigment features from the abiotic background.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2502.04214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems are widespread in both classical and quantum physics. The dynamics of such systems has recently become a focal point of research, showcasing surprising behaviors that include apparent violation of the adiabatic theorem and chiral topological conversion related to encircling exceptional points (EPs). These have both fundamental interest and potential practical applications. Yet the current literature features a number of apparently irreconcilable results. Here we develop a general theory for slow evolution of non-Hermitian systems and resolve these contradictions. We prove an analog of the adiabatic theorem for non-Hermitian systems and generalize it in the presence of uncontrolled environmental fluctuations (noise). The effect of noise turns out to be crucial due to inherent exponential instabilities present in non-Hermitian systems. Disproving common wisdom, the end state of the system is determined by the final Hamiltonian only, and is insensitive to other details of the evolution trajectory in parameter space. Our quantitative theory, leading to transparent physical intuition, is amenable to experimental tests. It provides efficient tools to predict the outcome of the system&#x27;s evolution, avoiding the need to follow costly time-evolution simulations. Our approach may be useful for designing devices based on non-Hermitian physics and may stimulate analyses of classical and quantum non-Hermitian-Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as that of quantum Lindbladian and hybrid-Liouvillian systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.09254v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We present a novel systematic theoretical framework to analyze the rate-distortion (R-D) limits of learned image compression. While recent neural codecs have achieved remarkable empirical results, their distance from the information-theoretic limit remains unclear. Our work addresses this gap by decomposing the R-D performance loss into three key components: variance estimation, quantization strategy, and context modeling. First, we derive the optimal latent variance as the second moment under a Gaussian assumption, providing a principled alternative to hyperprior-based estimation. Second, we quantify the gap between uniform quantization and the Gaussian test channel derived from the reverse water-filling theorem. Third, we extend our framework to include context modeling, and demonstrate that accurate mean prediction yields substantial entropy reduction. Unlike prior R-D estimators, our method provides a structurally interpretable perspective that aligns with real compression modules and enables fine-grained analysis. Through joint simulation and end-to-end training, we derive a tight and actionable approximation of the theoretical R-D limits, offering new insights into the design of more efficient learned compression systems.</p>

We analyze the IF encoder in terms of a very general notion of approximate bandwidth, which is shared by most commonly-used signal models. This complements results on exact encoding that may be overly adapted to a particular signal model. We take into account, possibly for the first time, the effect of uncertainty in the exact location of the spikes (as may arise by decimation), uncertainty of integration leakage (as may arise in realistic manufacturing), and boundary effects inherent to finite periods of exposure to the measurement device. The analysis is done by means of a concrete bandwidth-based Ansatz that can also be useful to initialize more sophisticated model specific reconstruction algorithms, and uses the earth mover&#x27;s (Wasserstein) distance to measure spike discrepancy.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2403.02968v4 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Locality is a fundamental feature of many physical time evolutions. Assumptions on locality and related structural properties also underlie recently proposed procedures for learning an unknown Hamiltonian from access to the induced time evolution. However, no protocols to rigorously test whether an unknown Hamiltonian is local were known. We investigate Hamiltonian locality testing as a property testing problem, where the task is to determine whether an unknown $n$-qubit Hamiltonian $H$ is $k$-local or $\varepsilon$-far from all $k$-local Hamiltonians, given access to the time evolution along $H$. First, we emphasize the importance of the chosen distance measure: With respect to the operator norm, a worst-case distance measure, incoherent quantum locality testers require $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n)$ many time evolution queries and an expected total evolution time of $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n / \varepsilon)$, and even coherent testers need $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ many queries and $\Omega(2^{n/2}/\varepsilon)$ total evolution time. In contrast, when distances are measured according to the normalized Frobenius norm, corresponding to an average-case distance, we give a sample-, time-, and computationally efficient incoherent Hamiltonian locality testing algorithm based on randomized measurements. In fact, our procedure can be used to simultaneously test a wide class of Hamiltonian properties beyond locality. Finally, we prove that learning a general Hamiltonian remains exponentially hard with this average-case distance, thereby establishing an exponential separation between Hamiltonian testing and learning. Our work initiates the study of property testing for quantum Hamiltonians, demonstrating that a broad class of Hamiltonian properties is efficiently testable even with limited quantum capabilities, and positioning Hamiltonian testing as an independent area of research alongside Hamiltonian learning.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.09187v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We propose a new method to describe the population dynamics of distinct configurational states based on a continuous-time description of state-to-state transitions. According to classical reaction dynamics theory, the probability density associated with a given state obeys the Liouville equation, the probability density associate d with a given state obeys the Li ouville equation, including influx from and efflux to neighboring states. By introducing a Markov approximation for the crossing of boundaries separating the states, tractable integral equations governing the state populations are derived. Once the time-dependent quantities appearing in these equations are evaluated, the population dynamics on long timescales can be obtained. Because these quantities depend only on a few states in the local neighborhood of a given state, they can be computed using a set of short-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We apply the present method to the binding and unbinding kinetics of CH$_4$/CH$_4$, Na$^+$/Cl$^-$, and 18-crown-6-ether (crown ether)/K$^+$ in water. For both kinetics, the time constants estimated from the present method are almost comparable to those obtained from brute-force MD simulations. The required timescale of each MD trajectory in the present method is approximately two orders of magnitude shorter than that in the brute-force MD approach in the crown ether/K$^+$ system. This reduction in the trajectory timescale enables applications to complex binding and unbinding sy stems whose characteristic timescales a re far beyond those directly acce ssible by brute-force MD simulati ons.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.09362v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Disjunct matrices, also known as cover-free families and superimposed codes, are combinatorial arrays widely used in group testing. Among their variants, those that satisfy an additional combinatorial property called inclusiveness form a special class suitable for computationally efficient and highly error-tolerant group testing under the general inhibitor complex model, a broad framework that subsumes practical settings such as DNA screening. Despite this relevance, the asymptotic behavior of the inclusive variant of disjunct matrices has remained largely unexplored. In particular, it was not previously known whether this variant can achieve an asymptotically positive rate, a requirement for scalable group testing designs. In this work, we establish the first nontrivial asymptotic lower bound on the maximum achievable rate of the inclusive variant, which matches the strongest known upper bound up to a logarithmic factor. Our proof is based on the probabilistic method and yields a simple and efficient randomized construction. Furthermore, we derandomize this construction to obtain a deterministic polynomial-time construction. These results clarify the asymptotic potential of robust and scalable group testing under the general inhibitor complex model.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08116v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Tropical cyclones are dangerous natural hazards, but their hazard is challenging to quantify directly from historical datasets due to limited dataset size and quality. Models of cyclone intensification fill this data gap by simulating huge ensembles of synthetic hurricanes based on estimates of the storm&#x27;s large scale environment. Both physics-based and statistical/ML intensification models have been developed to tackle this problem, but an open question is: can a physically reasonable and simple physics-style differential equation model of intensification be learned from data? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative by presenting a 10-term cubic stochastic differential equation model of Tropical Cyclone intensification. The model depends on a well-vetted suite of engineered environmental features known to drive intensification and is trained using a high quality dataset of hurricane intensity (IBTrACS) with estimates of the cyclone&#x27;s large scale environment from a data-assimilated simulation (ERA5 reanalysis), restricted to the Northern Hemisphere. The model generates synthetic intensity series which capture many aspects of historical intensification statistics and hazard estimates in the Northern Hemisphere. Our results show promise that interpretable, physics style models of complex earth system dynamics can be learned using automated system identification techniques.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08855v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Efficient resolution of neuroinflammation and debris clearance is a key determinant of successful central nervous system regeneration. Regenerative vertebrates such as Danio rerio often exhibit faster immune resolution and debris clearance than mammals, yet the molecular determinants underlying these differences remain incompletely understood. TAM receptor tyrosine kinases (Tyro3, Axl, and Mertk) and their ligands Gas6 and Protein S are central regulators of phagocytosis and immune resolution in the nervous system, but whether intrinsic structural properties of these receptor-ligand complexes contribute to regenerative efficiency has not been systematically explored. Here, we present a comparative in silico analysis of TAM receptors and ligands from zebrafish, human, and mouse, integrating sequence evolution, high-confidence structural modeling, interface characterization, and electrostatic analysis. Despite substantial sequence divergence, ligand-binding domains display strong structural conservation, supporting a conserved global mode of TAM-ligand engagement. At the interface level, zebrafish complexes show enhanced electrostatic contributions and increased salt-bridge density, particularly in the Tyro3-Protein S interaction. Residue-level electrostatic analysis reveals clustered interface hotspots that are spatially conserved across species despite evolutionary rewiring of individual contacts. Together, these results suggest that TAM receptor-ligand interfaces are evolutionarily tuned through subtle electrostatic and geometric optimization rather than large-scale structural changes, providing a conserved yet adaptable framework for species-specific modulation of phagocytic signaling.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2506.17139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models trained on equilibrium molecular distributions have proven effective for sampling biomolecules. Beyond direct sampling, the score of such a model can also be used to derive the forces that act on molecular systems. However, while classical diffusion sampling usually recovers the training distribution, the corresponding energy-based interpretation of the learned score is often inconsistent with this distribution, even for low-dimensional toy systems. We trace this inconsistency to inaccuracies of the learned score at very small diffusion timesteps, where the model must capture the correct evolution of the data distribution. In this regime, diffusion models fail to satisfy the Fokker-Planck equation, which governs the evolution of the score. We interpret this deviation as one source of the observed inconsistencies and propose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker-Planck-derived regularization term to enforce consistency. We demonstrate our approach by sampling and simulating multiple biomolecular systems, including fast-folding proteins, and by introducing a state-of-the-art transferable Boltzmann emulator for dipeptides that supports simulation and achieves improved consistency and efficient sampling.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.09187v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We propose a new method to describe the population dynamics of distinct configurational states based on a continuous-time description of state-to-state transitions. According to classical reaction dynamics theory, the probability density associated with a given state obeys the Liouville equation, the probability density associate d with a given state obeys the Li ouville equation, including influx from and efflux to neighboring states. By introducing a Markov approximation for the crossing of boundaries separating the states, tractable integral equations governing the state populations are derived. Once the time-dependent quantities appearing in these equations are evaluated, the population dynamics on long timescales can be obtained. Because these quantities depend only on a few states in the local neighborhood of a given state, they can be computed using a set of short-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We apply the present method to the binding and unbinding kinetics of CH$_4$/CH$_4$, Na$^+$/Cl$^-$, and 18-crown-6-ether (crown ether)/K$^+$ in water. For both kinetics, the time constants estimated from the present method are almost comparable to those obtained from brute-force MD simulations.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2503.15863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Long ago, life discovered how to efficiently push electrons thermodynamically uphill to lower potential by harnessing energy released by an equal number of electrons moving downhill. Known as electron bifurcation, this form of energy transduction has never been observed in the absence of natural enzymes. To successfully bifurcate electrons, a system must block short-circuit electron transfers that allow all electrons to flow downhill, while maintaining productive reactions. It is difficult to design systems that catalyze these highly-selective electron flows while minimizing free energy dissipation. Using theories of electron transfer and charge transport, I introduce semiconductor-electrolyte junctions that spontaneously bifurcate electrons analogously to natural enzymes (bifurcating junctions). I simulate a simple but illustrative bifurcating junction with typical material properties, and discuss how more complicated designs could achieve higher performance.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Computational/spectroscopic study of how Na2CO3 selectively depresses Ca-activated quartz (vs spodumene) during fatty-acid flotation in process water, with limited direct relevance to origins-of-life beyond general mineral–surface chemistry context.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spodumene separation from gangue minerals such as quartz is challenging, as both silicate minerals are activated by metal cations, naturally present in process water, like Ca2+. Research has shown that when used as a pH modifier, Na2CO3 can depress both minerals, to different degrees, in the presence of Ca2+, but the mechanisms remain unclear. We use spectroscopic and computational methods to examine the interaction of Na2CO3 with Ca-activated quartz and spodumene surfaces in the presence of sodium oleate (NaOL) and the consequences for their selective flotation. Our results indicate that adsorption competition between the collector (Ca/OL complexes) and depressant (CaCO3) species occurs on spodumene and quartz surfaces. We provide detailed mechanisms of the interactions, including with respect to the adsorbed species, their relative amounts, surface charge, and the adsorption strengths. Although both the collector and depressant were adsorbed onto both minerals, the collector had more affinity for spodumene than quartz (-296.14 kJ/mol vs -192.99 kJ/mol), unlike the depressant (-288.55 kJ/mol vs -311.59 kJ/mol), hence the soda ash induced surface deprotonation and desorption of Ca/OL complexes from quartz during conditioning, but not from spodumene. Unlike quartz, which had only Ca as the surface site for reagent adsorption, spodumene also had surface Al sites. The results explain the limited depression of spodumene and the total depression of quartz in flotation using fatty acid-based collectors. Specifically, in the presence of Ca2+, Na2CO3 treatment increased the Li2O grades from 2.53 to 4.40 %, while maintaining a high lithium recovery of 71 %. Overall, the study demonstrated that, in addition to being a pH modifier, Na2CO3 acts as a selective quartz depressant in the Ca-activated flotation of spodumene-quartz, making it a more effective pH modifier than NaOH directly prior to spodumene flotation. Since quartz is a common gangue mineral in most flotation systems, these findings can be applied to benefit other flotation systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Multinary tellurates, particularly those with quaternary and ternary compositions, form a unique group of compounds known for their diverse structural frameworks and notable electrochemical properties. This review brings together current knowledge about these materials, organising them based on their main mobile cation families (i.e., alkali, alkaline-earth, and coinage metals) and highlighting their promise in energy storage applications and beyond. Beyond simply reviewing these material classes, it also suggests future research directions aimed at establishing multinary tellurates as versatile functional materials in the swiftly evolving field of next-generation energy storage and related technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nature has settled for L-chirality for proteinogenic amino acids and D-chirality for the carbohydrate backbone of nucleotides. Further stereochemical patterns exist among natural products produced by common biosynthetic pathways. Here we asked the question whether these regularities might be sufficiently prevalent among natural products (NPs) such that their stereochemistry could be machine learned and assigned automatically. Indeed, we report that a language model can be trained to assign the stereochemistry of NPs using the open access NP database COCONUT. In detail, our language model, called NPstereo, translates an NP structure written as absolute SMILES into the corresponding isomeric SMILES notation containing stereochemical information, with 80.2% per-stereocenter accuracy for full assignments and 85.9% per-stereocenter accuracy for partial assignments, across various NP classes including secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, polyketides, lipids and terpenes. NPstereo might be useful to assign or correct the stereochemistry of newly discovered NPs. Scientific contribution: Our study reports that a language model, NPstereo, can learn and predict the stereochemistry of natural products (NPs) from their 2D structures with high accuracy. This work demonstrates that NP stereochemical patterns are machine learnable from data and represents a first step for scalable computational methodologies for stereochemical assignment of newly discovered NPs.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> A perspective on where sodium sulfate by-products arise across the lithium-ion battery lifecycle and how industry might reduce, reuse, or valorize this waste stream, with no direct connection to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The rapid expansion of the lithium-ion battery (LIB) industry has resulted in a significant increase in sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) generation, making it one of the most abundant inorganic by-products across the entire battery value chain. Na2SO4 is formed at multiple stages, during the lithium ore processing, the synthesis of nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) precursors or upon the hydrometallurgical recycling of production scraps and end-of-life LIBs. This growing volume of Na2SO4 presents serious environmental and economic challenges, particularly at the industrial scale, where wastewater management is becoming increasingly problematic. In this perspective article, we first assess the origins and quantities of Na2SO4 generated throughout the LIB lifecycle, then, we review current large-scale utilization practices and evaluate recent literature on emerging valorization strategies. While conventional reuse options remain limited, several approaches including new developments and processes to reduce Na2SO4 generation, upcycling of Na2SO4 into higher-value products, or reintegrating it into the battery supply chain appear to be promising and sustainable paths forward. Overall, this work underscores the urgency of addressing Na2SO4 accumulation and outlines diverse valorization opportunities within and beyond the battery industry.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Hierarchical patterns are widespread in natural and synthetic systems, yet their formation is most often interpreted through diffusion-driven instabilities or static geometric constructions. While successful in many contexts, these frameworks struggle to encode growth history, temporal asymmetry, and pattern formation in non-diffusive, out-of-equilibrium systems. Here, I introduce the TRACE model (Temporal Recording through Arrested Coupled Evolution), a minimal framework in which pattern formation emerges from the competition between front propagation and kinetic arrest, without invoking diffusive transport. Growing domains leave geometric footprints that record their individual growth histories through exclusion. Numerical simulations reveal a broad spectrum of emergent patterns—including cell-like domains, stripes, banded structures, and hierarchical boundaries—arising from variations in spatial confinement, nucleation timing, and domain density. Crucially, the number and scale of patterns depend on accumulated domain interactions rather than nucleation alone. Finally, the model qualitatively reproduces key features observed in a minimal two-component chemical system exhibiting hierarchical macroscopic pattern formation, establishing a diffusion-free route to hierarchy encoded as a geometric record of growth history.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cluster-assembled materials (CAMS) are an emerging category of modular solids that interconnect atomic precision with functional tunability. This work highlights ligand-induced dimensionality control in Ag12 cluster-based assemblies, achieved through functionalization of the organic linker. Two distinct cluster assemblies were fabricated from the geometrically distinct Ag12 core utilizing pyrazine and 2 amino-pyrazine linkers. A three-dimensional (SSICG20) framework was achieved through the accumulation of Ag12 cluster core pyrazine as a bridging ligand, while the latter one constructs a two-dimensional (SSICG21) sheet-like structure. Both frameworks exhibit distinct architectures with modulating charge transfer capability, particularly evidenced through their applicability in the charge transport measurements via linear device preparation and electro catalytic urea oxidation reaction. In investigations of the I-V measurements, both SSICG20 and SSICG21 demonstrated stable ON/OFF ratios throughout 1000 cycles, followed by SSICG20 showing superior memory response. Aligned with its superior switching response, SSICG20 showed promising catalytic efficiency in the electro catalytic urea oxidation reaction in harsh alkaline seawater conditions, with a significantly reduced onset potential of 110 mV at a current density of 10 mA, surpassing its 2D counterpart. A sustainable solar-driven overall water electrolysis experiment was also employed, which showed quite an optimistic efficiency. Collectively, this work provides a fundamental insight into the interplay of charge transportation on silver cluster assembly via dimensionality Modulation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Rapid and reliable detection of Clostridioides difficile is essential for clinical diagnosis and infection control. Building on our group’s prior development of RNA-cleaving fluorogenic DNAzymes (RFDs) for bacterial recognition, we report RFD-CD3, a fluorogenic DNAzyme with the highest catalytic efficiency reported to date for C. difficile-responsive DNAzymes, achieving a detection limit of 10³ CFU/mL and a catalytic rate constant (kobs) of 0.16 min⁻¹ for its engineered trans-acting variant (RFD-CD3-TM2). This trans-acting form also retains high activity and provides modularity for biosensor design, further extending the versatility of this platform. Unexpectedly, RFD-CD3 also responds to Listeria monocytogenes, making it the first DNAzyme known to be selectively activated by two phylogenetically distinct bacterial species. As no RFD has previously been reported for L. monocytogenes, this discovery opens new opportunities for DNAzyme-based biosensing of a clinically and food-relevant pathogen. The distinct clinical contexts of the two targets—C. difficile in stool and L. monocytogenes in blood or food—highlight the potential of RFD-CD3 as a versatile molecular tool suited to multiple diagnostic applications. RFD-CD3 also remains catalytically active at alkaline pH, enhancing its stability in nuclease-rich biological samples. Together, these features position RFD-CD3 as a promising dual-target platform for high-performance diagnostics in both clinical and food safety applications.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Age-related skeletal muscle deterioration is a commonly reported disability among older adults, attributed to several factors including mitochondrial dysfunction, a major hallmark of aging. Therapies to attenuate or reverse mitochondrial decline are limited. Despite identified positive relationships between vitamin B12 (B12) and mitochondrial biology, the impact of B12 supplementation on skeletal muscle mitochondria, in advanced aged, has not been examined. Thus, the impact of B12 supplementation on skeletal muscle mitochondrial biology was examined in (i) aged female mice, given 12 weeks of B12 supplementation (SUPP) or vehicle control, and (ii) in human primary myotubes. In the mouse model, mitochondrial DNA and content were measured with PCR and citrate synthase activity, respectively; mitochondrial morphology was examined using transmission electron microscopy; mitochondrial function was examined using extracellular metabolic flux analysis; and proteins and pathway enrichment was identified with proteomics. In the cell model, ROS and glutathione was measured using luminescent assays. The results demonstrated that SUPP in aged mice increased muscle mitochondrial content and improved morphology. Further, differentially expressed proteins were enriched in TCA cycle, OXPHOS, and oxidative stress pathways. In the cell model, B12 supplementation reduced ROS levels. This is the first study, to our knowledge, examining the impact of B12 supplementation on skeletal muscle mitochondrial biology in aged female mice. Results suggest that B12 supplementation improves mitochondrial biology in aged female mice.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The role of aromatic gut-derived bacterial metabolites (GDBMs) in shaping immune cell metabolism and function remains poorly explored. Using ex vivo metabolomic profiling of paired plasma and CD4+ T-cells from people living with HIV-1 (PLWH), we identified a network of aromatic GDBMs whose cell-associated abundance, rather than systemic levels, was linked to broad alterations in CD4+ T-cell metabolic and functional states. Among these metabolites, p-cresol sulfate (PCS) emerged as a mechanistic prototype investigated in depth. Ex vivo flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing of CD4+ T-cells stratified by cell-associated PCS levels revealed dose-dependent enrichment of transcriptional programs associated with impaired differentiation capacity, regulatory-like identity, and cellular senescence. Consistently, in vitro transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of PCS-exposed CD4+ T cells demonstrated induction of cell-cycle arrest, mitochondrial dysfunction, and senescence-associated programs, including upregulation of p16 and p21. Integration of these immunometabolic features with measurements of HIV-1 reservoir size in PLWH revealed that CD4+ T-cell states defined by cell-associated GDBMs track with intact proviral DNA levels in vivo. Together, these findings define a microbiome-derived axis that reshapes CD4+ T-cell metabolism and fate and promotes immune aging-associated states in PLWH. Our data suggest that cell-associated GDBMs may foster immunometabolic CD4+ T-cell states previously linked to long-term HIV-1 reservoir persistence in vivo.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mutation hotspots in melanoma frequently occur at DNA binding sites of ETS-family transcription factors, as ETS factors stimulate the formation of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) while suppressing repair at ETS-bound DNA sites. To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which ETS factors bind to damaged DNA sites and inhibit repair, we investigated the binding of members from the three major classes of the ETS superfamily (Ets1, ELF1 and PU.1) to cognate DNA containing a cis-syn TpT CPD. These site-specific CPDs modulated ETS recognition and repair by a model repair enzyme in a position-dependent manner, with a deaminated CPD located in a damage hotspot in the ETS binding motif consistently stimulating binding and repair inhibition by all three paralogs. Co-crystal structures of PU.1 reveal that CPDs and mismatches are recognized within the framework of canonical ETS/DNA complexes, but with highly differentiated thermodynamic and dynamic properties. Specifically, the CPD-bound complex exhibits unique dynamics that reveal a novel DNA-binding mode as well as inform how ETS domains navigate the DNA conformational landscape to predispose CPD induction. The results offer a molecular rationale for how ETS factors induce mutation hotspots in skin cancers and other UV-exposed tissues by promoting CPD induction and inhibiting repair.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> BioRxiv preprint engineering an allosterically gated DNMT3A–CasX epigenetic repressor to improve on-target methylation and reduce off-target transcriptional effects, mainly relevant to genome engineering rather than origins-of-life research (keyword match: DNA).</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> CRISPR-based epigenetic editing enables durable and reversible control of gene expression, overcoming the transient nature of RNA interference and antisense oligonucleotides while avoiding the permanent DNA alterations of other CRISPR-based approaches. Current epigenome editors that fuse the DNMT3A catalytic domain to a DNA-binding module such as catalytically inactive Cas9 deposit CpG methylation to silence gene transcription, but can exhibit off-target activity, cellular toxicity, and transcriptome-wide perturbations due to unconstrained methyltransferase activity. In contrast, DNMT3A regulation in its native context involves autoinhibition of its catalytic activity by its ATRX-DNMT3A-DNMT3L (ADD) domain, which is relieved only upon allosteric activation through recognition of unmodified H3K4 (H3K4me0). Here, we engineered this endogenous allosteric control into CRISPR-based epigenetic editors by designing compact Epigenetic Long Term CasX-based Repressors (ELXRs) containing an allosterically-gated DNMT3A. Allosteric ELXR substantially reduced off-target methylation, rescued dose-dependent growth defects in methylation-sensitive systems, and maintained or enhanced on-target activity across multiple loci (on average [≥]4-fold increased activity). We find that integration of DNMT3A allostery is more effective within the CasX framework than with Cas9-based systems, indicating that the increased precision targeting of CasX may be required for the allosteric gate to reduce off-target effects. Mechanistically, the engineered allostery establishes a multi-step gating process in which DNMT3A activation and subsequent CpG methylation occur only after conversion of H3K4me3 to H3K4me0, which we establish requires potentiation by a transcriptional repressor domain. Targeted mutagenesis of ADD confirms this allosteric mechanism in ELXRs matches endogenous DNMT3A regulation. Transcriptome-wide profiling further demonstrated substantially improved specificity with allosteric ELXRs, which were found to reduce the number of differentially expressed genes by 10-100-fold compared with their non-allosteric counterparts. In vivo, lipid nanoparticle delivery of ELXRs achieved potent, durable PCSK9 silencing with precise on-target promoter methylation and minimal off-target transcriptional effects. To date, CRISPR specificity has been governed primarily by gRNA-DNA interactions. By synthetically reconstructing DNMT3A&#x27;s allosteric control, we introduce a new regulatory layer that enhances the fidelity and specificity of CRISPR-based epigenetic editing and establishes a general framework for engineering more precise CRISPR-based therapeutics.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Comprehensive transcriptome profiling is essential for understanding RNA diversity and regulation, yet accurate identification and quantification of full-length transcript isoforms remain challenging with short-read sequencing technologies. Nanopore sequencing enables direct sequencing of long cDNA molecules and thus offers a powerful solution for full-length transcriptome analysis, but its application to quantitative transcriptomics is limited by PCR amplification bias and the difficulty of unique molecular identifier (UMI) recognition under high sequencing error rates. Here, we developed UMImap, a dedicated pipeline for robust UMI identification, error correction, and deduplication in nanopore data. By integrating transcript-aware UMI correction with long-read isoform assembly, UMImap substantially improves UMI recognition accuracy compared with existing methods and effectively mitigates PCR-induced duplication bias. Using this framework, we identified tens of thousands of full-length transcript isoforms, including a large fraction of previously unannotated isoforms that are significantly longer than reference annotations. Quantitative analyses demonstrate the reliability of UMImap for transcript-level quantification. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses of highly expressed novel isoforms revealed coherent and biologically meaningful patterns, including strong enrichment in RNA processing, splicing, and translation pathways. Our results establish UMImap as an effective solution for UMI-based quantification in nanopore full-length transcriptome sequencing and highlight the potential of long-read sequencing to simultaneously achieve accurate isoform discovery and expression analysis in complex transcriptomes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mutualistic interactions are widely hypothesized to expand ecological niches and promote diversification, yet evidence for this relationship at macroevolutionary scales remains limited. Here, we investigate how fungal seed endophytes (Epichloe) influence niche breadth and diversification across over 100 species of the globally-distributed grass genus Poa. Combining global-scale climate, environmental, phylogenetic, and symbiosis data, we constructed species distribution models for suites of symbiotic and non-symbiotic plant species, then used a range of phylogenetic comparative methods to assess the influence of these symbionts on niche breadth, niche breadth evolution, and diversification. Endophyte-positive species had ~1.4 times broader primary niche axes (most often associated with temperature tolerances), ~2.5 times larger geographic ranges, and &gt;30 times faster rates of niche breadth evolution than non-symbiotic species. Endophytic plants also had significantly drier climate centroids, consistent with endophyte-mediated drought tolerance, while simultaneously showing constraints along specific niche dimensions. Despite pronounced niche expansion, hidden state speciation and extinction models revealed two modes of diversification: endophytes decrease diversification rates in young lineages, and have a neutral effect in older lineages. Together, our results demonstrate that mutualists can enhance ecological flexibility while simultaneously constraining macroevolutionary outcomes, revealing a decoupling of niche expansion and diversification, and highlighting the complex role of symbiosis in shaping host evolutionary trajectories.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Software requirements classification remains one of the important challenges in requirements engineering. Engineering that affects the smoothness of project success about software development life cycles. in this paper, a novel hybrid solution is being presented that beats the benchmarks set by previous approaches using TF-IDF. The vectorization, coupled with SBERT embeddings, has been further reinforced by application of SMOTE-Tomek resampling. The solution addresses typical limitations detected in Ors baseline solution, which achieved 76.16% {+/-} 2.58% accuracy of the model using the conventional SMOTE-Tomek pre-processing with logistic regression. Via comprehensive experimentation on the PROMISE dataset containing 969 categorized requirements accross 12 classes, our hybrid feature engineering approach has shown significant improvements: Random Forest achieves. Thus, the character CNN records an accuracy of 74.40% {+/-} 3.00% versus the baseline 60.37% {+/-} 2.76%, while critically, Naive Bayes shows remarkable improvement from complete failure 0.00% to 53.97% {+/-} 5.08% accuracy. The integration of semantic contextual understanding through SBBERT, with statistical term importances via TF-IDF, forms a robust representation space that captures the synthetic pattern along with semantic relations in the texts of requirements. Our methodology uses stratified 10-fold cross-validation with Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). Evaluation, Ensuring reliable performance assessment across imbalanced classes. The results demonstrate that hybrid feature engineering, when combined with appropriate resampling techniques, provides a more effective solution for automated software requirement classification than traditional pre-processing methods alone.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Artificial selection on Drosophila cuticle color produces modest, repeatable correlated changes in aggression and basal activity, illustrating genetic covariation among traits but with limited direct relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding whether traits evolve independently or as integrated units is central to predicting adaptive evolution. Correlated trait evolution can reflect genetic covariation, such that selection on one trait can constrain or redirect evolutionary responses in others. Here, we used artificial selection on cuticle color in Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans to investigate whether color and behavior evolve in tandem. We selected for light and dark thoracic colors across 16 generations in two populations per species and measured correlated responses in a suite of behavioral traits, including aggression, basal activity, total activity, sleep, and geotaxis. Dark selected individuals generally showed higher aggression and basal activity than light selected or control flies across both species and sexes, pointing to a modest but repeatable correlated response that must be interpreted in light of low and variable aggression in our assay. In contrast, patterns for geotaxis, sleep, and total activity evolved unpredictably, often varying across species and populations, and showed no clear or uniform association with color. Taken together, our results suggest that some behaviors may share a predictable relationship with color, whereas others behave largely independently under the conditions we examined. The persistence of correlated responses in aggression and basal activity in response to selection on color is consistent with a conserved genetic basis, such as pleiotropy or tight linkage, although our data do not, by themselves, distinguish among these mechanisms. Future work that identifies the loci underlying variation in both color and behavior and tests their effects experimentally will be important for clarifying how multivariate genetic covariance shapes the direction and pace of adaptive evolution.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study uses population genomics and transcriptomics to show repeated, independent cis-regulatory mutations can generate the same electric communication signal phenotype within a fish species, informing behavioral evolution but only tangentially relevant to Origins of Life.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Behavioral diversity is a striking result of species diversity, shaped by intertwined mechanisms, developmental pathways, and evolutionary histories. Yet the genetic underpinnings of behavioral evolution remain obscure, even though they are key to understanding how organisms adapt and diversify. Weakly electric African elephantfishes provide a rare opportunity to dissect the genetics of behavior because their electric communication signals are quantifiable, stereotyped, and directly tied to identifiable cellular mechanisms. Among elephantfishes, electric organ discharges (EODs) vary widely across species and populations, shaping mate choice, social interactions, and reproductive isolation. A key axis of this diversity is the presence or absence of an initial phase in the EOD waveform: a discrete, repeated evolutionary transition whose genetic basis has remained unresolved. Here we show, using whole-genome resequencing, population-genomic analyses, transcriptomics, and histology from 306 specimens, that biphasic EODs in Paramormyrops kingsleyae have evolved repeatedly through independent de novo regulatory mutations at distinct genomic loci. These population specific mutations occur exclusively in noncoding regions, show localized signatures of selection, and are associated with differences in gene expression and protein localization in the electric organ, indicating that they act through cis-regulatory mechanisms affecting electrocyte development. These findings challenge the expectation that repeated within-species adaptations primarily draw from standing ancestral variation, revealing instead that the developmental program underlying electric signaling contains multiple points of regulatory sensitivity. Distinct genetic changes can therefore produce the same behavioral phenotype, enabling repeated evolutionary transitions even within a single species. More broadly, our results show how developmental architecture shapes the evolutionary pathways available to behavior, helping explain why communication signals in elephantfishes, and in other radiations, diversify so rapidly.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables detailed analysis of cellular heterogeneity, but standard clustering approaches can miss rare cell populations with important disease relevance. We present an outlier-aware framework that complements clustering by identifying statistically unusual cells. Applied to COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples, this approach revealed strong disease-associated enrichment of outliers: 9.62% in moderate disease and 6.16% in severe disease, compared with 1.14% in healthy controls. These cells exhibited elevated cytotoxic marker expression (NKG7, GZMB, PRF1, GNLY; 2.0-2.9x enrichment) consistent with activated effector immune states, with replication across independent datasets. To verify that outliers were not low-quality cells, we confirmed superior QC metrics: outliers showed 68% more genes and 78% higher UMI counts than normal cells. Application to rheumatoid arthritis PBMCs showed modest enrichment (5.40% in RA vs. 4.66% in healthy), consistent with chronic inflammation. Comparison of four outlier detection algorithms identified Isolation Forest as the best-performing method. Subclustering revealed diverse functional states within outliers, including NK cytotoxic cells, activated T cells, and proliferating cells. Overall, outlier detection reveals rare, functionally distinct immune populations overlooked by conventional clustering.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> High-coverage genome sequencing of coppery titi monkeys maps &gt;13,000 structural variants and estimates de novo SV rates, informing primate evolution and disease modeling but offering minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Coppery titi monkeys (Plecturocebus cupreus) are an important non-human primate model for studying neurobiology and social behavior, in part owing to their relatively unusual combination of social monogamy and paternal care. Despite this importance, relatively little is known regarding the underlying population genomics of this platyrrhine. This study presents high-coverage, whole-genome sequencing data from 26 individuals which, combined with a highly accurate multi-algorithm ensemble approach, was used to characterize the first map of structural variation in the species. This novel genomic resource includes over 13,000 structural variants, with the majority (&gt;90%) being copy number variants. While many of these were found to be located in intergenic regions, several affected genes associated with disease, including an inversion predicted to impact a pathway implicated in early-onset Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Furthermore, utilizing parent-offspring trios included within this study, the de novo structural variant rate was estimated to be one in every 1.5 births, similar to that reported in rhesus macaques but considerably higher than that observed in large human cohorts, as may be expected from underlying differences in life history traits amongst these species. Taken together, these insights into the structural variant landscape of P. cupreus will not only improve their utility as a behavioral model system, but will also contribute to our general understanding of the role of structural variation in both the evolution of the primate clade and disease-outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a key predictive biomarker across multiple tumor types, but current next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based callers often depend on matched normals, large reference panels, or pretrained machine-learning models, which limits portability across assays and sequencing centers. We developed PROMIS (PROfiling of Microsatellite InStability), a tumor-only, reference-free pipeline that detects MSI by leveraging intrasample variability at predefined microsatellite loci. PROMIS models repeat-length distributions with a discrete mixture framework to distinguish stable germline configurations from unstable loci with additional allele populations. Locus-level classifications are aggregated into a continuous MSI score, defined as the fraction of unstable loci, which can then be used to classify samples as MSI-high or microsatellite-stable. We benchmarked PROMIS in colorectal (CRC), endometrial (UCEC), and gastric (STAD) cancers from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). PROMIS achieved an overall AUC of 0.995 and cohort-specific AUCs of 1.00 in CRC and STAD and 0.999 in UCEC, comparable to established tools despite not using matched normals or pretrained models. Subsampling and in silico dilutions showed robust performance with substantially fewer loci and down to 3% tumor fraction. Finally, in prostate and CRC cell-free DNA (cfDNA) cohorts, including Illumina TSO500 data and an 18-gene panel, PROMIS yielded assay-agnostic MSI scores concordant with orthogonal tissue- and panel-based classifications.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Precise chemical design continues to drive advances in RNA-based therapeutics. Here, we report the synthesis and site-specific incorporation of four canonical phosphoramidites (U, C, A, and G), each bearing non-natural nucleoside configurations: {beta}-D-2&#x27;-deoxyxylonucleosides and -L-2&#x27;-deoxyribonucleosides. These stereochemically distinct nucleoside analogs were introduced at positions 6 and 7 within siRNA seed regions. When applied to siRNAs targeting Ttr, ACTN1, and Marc1, these modifications reduced off-target gene repression in functional assays and, in several cases, in transcriptome-wide differential expression analyses, while preserving robust on-target activity. In vivo, Marc1-targeting siRNAs containing these modified nucleosides showed decreased hepatotoxicity, as evidenced by reduced serum ALT and AST levels. Collectively, these findings establish {beta}-D-2&#x27;-deoxyxylonucleoside and -L-2&#x27;-deoxyribonucleoside analogs as promising chemical tools for enhancing the specificity and safety of siRNA therapeutics. This work underscores the power of integrating rational nucleoside design with comprehensive functional and in vivo evaluation to advance drug development based on RNA interference (RNAi).</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Develops a mathematical framework for evolutionarily stable ideal-free dispersal in time-periodic, diffusive Lotka–Volterra predator–prey communities, with limited direct relevance to origins-of-life questions beyond general evolutionary dynamics.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We study the mechanism and effects of ideal free distributions (IFDs) on an ecological community consisting of n prey and m predator species, by considering the corresponding diffusive Lotka-Volterra system with time-periodic coefficients. We define a notion of joint IFD in a time-periodic environment, and give necessary and sufficient conditions for it to be achieved by a subcollection of prey and predator species with suitable dispersal strategies. Next, we show, via construction of a Lyapunov function, that such dispersal strategies are evolutionarily stable, in the sense that if a subcollection of prey and predator species adopts an ideal free dispersal strategy, then the total community must converge to an IFD for large time; if a unique combination of prey-predator species adopts an ideal free strategy, then it can drive all other species to extinction. Conversely, if a combination of prey-predator species adopts a non-ideal free dispersal strategy, then it can be invaded by some suitable mutant strategies. Our results provide insight into the evolution of spatial distribution of ecological communities with predator-prey interactions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mitochondrial diseases progressively lead to multisystemic failure with treatment options remaining extremely limited. To investigate novel strategies that alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction, we have generated an ubiquitous and tamoxifen-inducible knockout mouse model of mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM), a nuclear-encoded protein involved in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance, Tfamfl/flUbCre-ERT2 (iTfamKO) mice. Systemic TFAM deficiency triggers mitochondrial decline in a myriad of tissues in adult mice. Consequently, iTfamKO mice manifest multiorgan dysfunction including lipodystrophy, sarcopenia, metabolic alterations, kidney failure, neurodegeneration, and locomotor dysregulation, which result in the premature death of these mice. Interestingly, iTfamKO mice display intestinal barrier disruption and gut dysbiosis, with diminished levels of microbiota-derived short-fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate. Mice with a deficient proof-reading version of the mtDNA polymerase gamma (mtDNA-mutator mice) phenocopy the dysfunction of the intestinal barrier and bacterial dysbiosis with reduced levels of butyrate, suggesting that different mouse models of mitochondrial dysfunction share deficient generation of butyrate. Transfer of microbiota from healthy control mice or administration of tributyrin, a butyrate precursor, delay multiple signs of multimorbidity extending lifespan in iTfamKO mice. Mechanistically, butyrate supplementation recovers epigenetic histone acylation marks that are lost in the intestine of Tfam deficient mice. Overall, our findings highlight the relevance of preserving host microbiota symbiosis in disorders related to mitochondrial dysfunction.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> by Cristian Arsene, Alexander Gates, Anne-Katrin Römmert, André Märtens, Valentina Faustinelli, Luise Luckau, Gavin O’Connor We present a novel method for analyzing the folding of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), such as Tau and phosphorylated Tau (pTau), in solution. Using cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) combined with a new downstream analysis framework, we construct weighted interaction networks from cross-link–derived residue pairs without relying on predefined secondary structure assumptions. Structural differences between protein conformations are quantified by comparing the organization of loop structures within their cross-link networks. Validation with bovine serum albumin (BSA) in native and denatured states shows that at least 500 cross-links—requiring 5–10 replicate measurements—are needed for reliable detection of structural divergence. Leave-one-out analysis confirms that structural transitions are global, highlighting the importance of comprehensive cross-link datasets. The coverage of unique cross-links was evaluated using accumulation curves from randomized permutations. Saturation levels were found to be 9.7%, 5.0%, and 6.2% of the total 528 and 10,731 possible cross-links after 30, 84, and 62 technical replicates, respectively, for myoglobin, native BSA, and denatured BSA. For Tau and pTau, coverage reached 10.8% and 5.5% of the upper limit (8,256). Finally, applying our structural analysis to Tau and pTau during arachidonic acid–induced aggregation revealed distinct patterns of structural evolution between the two proteins.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> by Asmita Roy, Xianyang Zhang In genome-wide epigenetic studies, determining how exposures (e.g., Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) affect outcomes (e.g., gene expression) through intermediate variables, such as DNA methylation, is a key challenge. Mediation analysis provides a framework to identify these causal pathways; however, testing for mediation effects involves a complex composite null hypothesis. Existing methods, such as Sobel’s test or the Max-P test, are often underpowered in this context because they rely on null distributions determined under only a subset of the null space and are not optimized for the multiple testing burden inherent in high-dimensional data. To address these limitations, we introduce MLFDR (Mediation Analysis using Local False Discovery Rates), a novel method for high-dimensional mediation analysis. MLFDR leverages local false discovery rates, calculated from the coefficients of structural equation models, to construct an optimal rejection region. We demonstrate theoretically and through simulation that MLFDR asymptotically controls the false discovery rate and achieves superior statistical power compared to recent high-dimensional mediation methods. In real data applications, MLFDR identified 20%–50% more significant mediators than existing methods, demonstrating its ability to uncover biological signals missed by conventional approaches.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Benchmarks seven computational methods (notably CellBender and DecontX) for removing ambient RNA contamination in single-cell/single-nucleus RNA-seq across simulations and mixing experiments to improve downstream gene-expression analyses.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Gene expression profiling of single cells using single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing (sxRNA-seq) enables researchers to characterizing cellular heterogeneity and unraveling complex biological processes at unprecedented resolution. However, sxRNA-seq faces challenges due to the presence of ambient RNA, extraneous RNA molecules not originating from the cells of interest. Sample preparation is a major source of ambient RNA, where harsh conditions can lead to cell lysis and the release of intracellular RNA. This inescapable inclusion of ambient RNA can cause erroneous results and hinder downstream analyses. To address this issue, various methodologies have been developed to identify, quantify, and remove ambient RNA. Here, we rigorously evaluate 7 state-of-the-art methodologies for ambient RNA removal using simulated datasets, species-mixing experiments of varying complexities and genotype-mixing experiments. We find that no single method performs the best across all datasets and metrics, but CellBender and DecontX generally perform well.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study shows the bacterial nucleoid protein GapR binds AT-rich and overtwisted DNA extremely stably, mechanically stiffening and overtwisting duplex DNA to differentially stimulate or repress transcription and thereby promote efficient replication/transcription progression.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> GapR is an -proteobacterial nucleoid-associated protein reported to either directly regulate transcription of AT-rich DNA or to regulate transcription indirectly through sensing DNA topology and modulating topoisomerase activity. We use single-DNA micromechanics, biolayer interferometry (BLI), and computational analysis to study GapR transcriptional regulation. Micromechanics experiments show that GapR overtwists DNA and shortens its contour length. GapR binding also substantially increases DNA bending persistence length and twist stiffness, while promoting duplex DNA melting at higher forces. Nonequilibrium binding experiments show GapR-DNA complexes to be extremely stable, with essentially no dissociation on hour-long time scales. Strikingly, our BLI experiments show that GapR has high affinity for AT-rich DNA while our micromechanics show that GapR binding is enhanced by pre-twisting of DNA, validating GapR affinity for both forms. By analyzing published GapR binding data, we differentiate between AT-rich and overtwisted DNA binding, revealing that overtwisted DNA primarily determines GapR localization. Lastly, we show that these two binding modes exert opposite effects on transcription. AT-rich binding stimulates initiation, likely by promoting RNA polymerase progression, while overtwisted DNA binding represses transcription, possibly by stabilizing local overtwist at promoters. We propose that GapR binding promotes a conformation of DNA ideal for efficient replication and transcription progression.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Type VI collagen (COL6) is a key extracellular matrix protein that supports matrix organization and cell-matrix interactions, yet its regulation in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) remains poorly understood. Here, we characterize COL6 gene expression, spatial localization, remodeling, and functional effects of COL6-derived fragments. Analysis of publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data from 30 controls and 32 pulmonary fibrosis patients revealed higher expression of COL6A1-A6 in fibrotic lungs, predominantly in mesenchymal cells (A1: p=0.0002, A2: p=0.0005, A3: p=2.5x10-5, A5: p=0.016, A6: p=0.007). Immunohistochemical analysis of lung tissue from never-smoker (n=9), ex-smoker (n=9) controls, and IPF patients (n=12) showed extensive COL6 localization across parenchyma, airways, and vessels. The proportion of COL61 and COL62 was lower around IPF vessels (1: p&lt;0.001, 2: p=0.012), and COL62 was lower around IPF airways (p=0.033) compared with never-smokers. Quantification of COL6 remodeling fragments in lung tissue from never-smoker (n=3), ex-smoker (n=5) controls, and IPF patients (n=10) revealed that COL6 production (PRO-C6) localized around airways and vessels but was proportionally lower in IPF airways (never-smokers: p=0.0075). In contrast, COL6 degradation (C6M) was widely distributed throughout the tissue, with lower levels in IPF (never-smokers: p=0.0008). Functionally, COL6 and PRO-C6 increased fibroblast viability (COL6: p=0.002, PRO-C6: p=0.0021), while apoptosis was unaffected. Similar trends were observed in epithelial and endothelial cells. In summary, despite increased COL6 gene expression, IPF lungs exhibited lower proportions of COL6 protein and synthesis around airways and vessels, suggesting disrupted matrix organization, altered remodeling, and pro-survival effects that may contribute to fibroblast persistence and fibrosis progression.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> HIV-1 latency remains a major barrier to viral eradication. The persistence of the latently infected reservoirs results from multifactorial mechanisms controlling gene transcription and cellular responses to viral reactivation. The transcriptional repressor BCL11B/CTIP2 is known to promote the establishment and persistence of the latently infected reservoirs. However, its contribution to the cellular response to viral infection has not been investigated before. Together with HEXIM1, paraspeckles contribute to cellular innate sensing of viral infections and to the production of type I interferons. Paraspeckles are nuclear membrane-less organelles composed of proteins, including SFPQ/PSF and NONO, wrapped around the long non-coding RNA NEAT1. Here, we show that HIV-1 infection promotes a TLR3-mediated CTIP2 overexpression delayed from a transitory NEAT1 overexpression, paraspeckles formation and type I IFN production. In response to this interferon production, CTIP2 is recruited to the NEAT1 promotor together with HEXIM1 and repressive histone marks to inhibit NEAT1 gene expression. The resulting depletion of the paraspeckles abrogated INF production, dampening TLR3 signalling and reinforcing HIV-1 latency. Our results demonstrate CTIP2 as a dual-function regulator that silences HIV-1 transcription and restricts antiviral innate immune response as part of a negative feedback loop limiting the interferon response to viral infection.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This molecular genetics study shows that the human RNA-binding protein HuR preferentially binds a CCL2 3′UTR variant (rs13900T), increasing mRNA stability and translation and thereby modulating disease-linked CCL2 expression, with little direct relevance to origins-of-life questions beyond general RNA regulation.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> CC-chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) is involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases associated with monocyte/macrophage recruitment, such as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), tuberculosis, and atherosclerosis. The rs1024611 (alleles: A&gt;G; G is the risk allele) polymorphism in the CCL2 cis -regulatory region is associated with increased CCL2 expression in vitro and ex vivo, leukocyte mobilization in vivo, and deleterious disease outcomes. However, the molecular basis for the rs1024611-associated differential CCL2 expression remains poorly characterized. It is conceivable that genetic variant(s) in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs1024611 could mediate such effects. Previously, we used rs13900 (alleles: C&gt;T) in the CCL2 3′untranslated region (3′ UTR) that is in perfect LD with rs1024611 to demonstrate allelic expression imbalance (AEI) of CCL2 in heterozygous individuals. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the rs13900 could modulate CCL2 expression by altering mRNA turnover and/or translatability. The rs13900 T allele conferred greater stability to the CCL2 transcript when compared to the rs13900 C allele. The rs13900 T allele also had increased binding to Human Antigen R (HuR), an RNA-binding protein, in vitro and ex vivo. The rs13900 alleles imparted differential activity to reporter vectors and influenced the translatability of the reporter transcript. We further demonstrated the role of HuR in mediating allele-specific effects on CCL2 expression in overexpression and silencing studies. Our studies suggest that the differential interactions of HuR with rs13900 could modulate CCL2 expression and could in part explain the interindividual differences in CCL2-mediated disease susceptibility.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Common-garden study shows range-edge populations of a dioecious plant evolve smaller seeds, higher reproductive effort, and increased leaky sex expression consistent with selection for dispersal and reproductive assurance during range expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Range expansion involves repeated dispersal events and the establishment of new populations through colonisation. Natural selection is therefore expected to favour traits that enhance dispersal and enable uniparental reproduction when mates are scarce. There is substantial evidence that range-edge populations evolve both increased dispersal ability and, in hermaphroditic species, an enhanced capacity for self-fertilisation. By contrast, the evolution of a greater capacity for uniparental production has not yet been demonstrated for dioecious plants. Here, we report results from a large common-garden experiment to assess the life history and sex expression of males and females of the dioecious annual herb Mercurialis annua sampled from across its European range. We found that plants from range-edge populations in central and western Europe not only tend to have smaller seeds and greater reproductive effort (RE) than populations from the eastern Mediterranean Basin, from where the species expanded its range, but also that males and females have an increased incidence of leaky sex expression (the production of flowers of the opposite sex). Small seeds and high RE are associated with dispersal, and the colonisation of new populations, and leaky sex expression allows otherwise unisexual individuals to produce progeny by self-fertilisation. Our results suggest that leaky sex expression in this species has been enhanced by selection for reproductive assurance, rather than representing a by-product of developmental instability during floral development or a relic of an incomplete transition to dioecy, as has been proposed for other dioecious species exhibiting leaky sex expression.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> 1. Long-read sequencing data can provide increased taxonomic resolution and genomic linkage information that is otherwise impossible to obtain from short-read amplicon or shotgun sequencing. However, the use of long-read sequencing for environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis has thus far been limited by both the apparent rarity of long DNA molecules in eDNA samples and the lack of established bioinformatics workflows for long-read metabarcoding, particularly from mixed template samples. 2. Here, we report nanopore sequencing of 8.0 - 9.5 kb mitochondrial fragments obtained from mesocosm and field eDNA samples, amplified with long-range PCR (LR-PCR) using primers designed to preferentially amplify teleost mitogenomes. 3. We recovered half-mitochondria from 13 fish species in field-collected samples (Puget Sound in Washington State, USA), as well as from approximately half of the fish species inhabiting the positive control mesocosm (the Seattle Aquarium). Among biological replicates, we observed consistent detection of read-abundant species, while there was greater stochasticity in the presence of rarer species. 4. We demonstrate that long fragments can be obtained from standard eDNA samples and successfully amplified and sequenced to obtain species identifications despite higher error rates characteristic of nanopore sequencing. We present both laboratory methods and an accessible bioinformatic pipeline for obtaining and analyzing LR-PCR amplified fragments from eDNA, providing a framework for future long-read metabarcoding studies.</p>

They are also tightly linked to the planet’s properties, in particular those of the interior. As such they offer the unique opportunity to interpret […] The post Fundamentals Of Interior Modelling And Challenges In The Interpretation Of Observed Rocky Exoplanets appeared first on Astrobiology .</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The practical application of molecular nanocarbons in photocatalysis is often constrained by their short exciton diffusion lengths and limited light-harvesting capabilities. Cocrystal engineering represents a promising avenue to modulate the photophysical properties of organic semiconductors through precise donor-acceptor (D-A) integration. In this study, we demonstrate that cocrystallization of a series of modularly synthesized, ladder-type molecular nanocarbons (nDP) with 1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) or octafluoronaphthalene (OFN) affords a new class of charge-transfer cocrystals (CTCs) with tailored optoelectronic properties. Notably, the DP-TCNB exhibits exceptional photocatalytic performance for hydrogen peroxide production, achieving a remarkable evolution rate of 40500 μmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹ and an apparent quantum yield of 9.62% at 420 nm in a water/benzyl alcohol biphasic system. Detailed structural, spectroscopic, and electrochemical analyses reveal that the enhanced performance originates from strong intermolecular charge-transfer interactions, which lead to a reduced bandgap, prolonged charge carrier lifetime, and efficient suppression of electron-hole recombination. This work not only presents a high-performance molecular photocatalyst but also establishes cocrystal engineering as a robust and generalizable strategy for advancing molecular nanocarbon-based sustainable energy conversion.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The development of biomaterials that mimic the native extracellular matrix (ECM) of native tissue represents an exciting frontier for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Injectable nano-fiber hydrogels made of short, self-assembling peptides offer a promising platform for the delivery and directed differentiation of therapeutic stem cells. However, the rational design of peptide hydrogels remains a significant challenge in tissue engineering due to our lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underly self-assembly. Although these materials hold great promise, most computational design efforts have focused on studying how peptide sequence impacts aggregation propensity. While useful as an initial indicator of self-assembly, aggregation propensity can be misleading as it is nearly synonymous with hydrophobic precipitation, thus highlighting the need for more robust screening and design strategies. To address this limitation, we introduce a systematic approach via molecular dynamics for designing peptide hydrogels. Our approach introduces several new atomistic descriptors—end-to-end distance, π–π stacking interactions, and residue-specific contacts— derived from molecular dynamics simulations to capture the nuances of sequence-dependent nano-structural assembly. We additionally uncovered key interactions among hydrophobic, aromatic, and charged residues that reliably predict gel formation, enabling a more rational 2 approach to hydrogel design. We apply these molecular features to successfully predict a previously undiscovered, yet robust self-assembling sequence, KYYYL. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirms that our parameters provide significant differences among sequences whereas aggregation propensity failed to reject the null hypothesis. Finally, we establish the sensitivity of simulation parameters to ensure methodological rigor and enable future study expansion in peptide sequence space. Our findings reveal that amino acid selection and position influences self-assembly. Furthermore, we demonstrate the key interactions among varying residues that reliably predict gel formation, enabling a more rational approach to supramolecular hydrogel design and their nanostructure formation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding how pathogens evolve is fundamental to disease control and is a basic question in evolutionary biology, yet pathogens with complex life cycles violate assumptions of classic evolutionary models. Genetic analyses of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum have shown multiple surprising patterns. For example, empirical analyses produce effective population size estimates that vary by orders of magnitude depending on the method and an excess of genes with elevated nonsynonymous variation (measured as pi_N/pi_S). Here, reanalyzing genomic data from 18 worldwide populations, I show that these observations directly follow from distributions of genetic variation enriched for rare variants. Multiple potential mechanisms may increase the proportion of rare variants, including host expansions, lifecycle dynamics, population structure, or selection. The observed genealogies are more consistent with a multiple-merger coalescent than a Kingman coalescent, causing common summary statistics to be biased in predictable directions. In particular, the abundance of rare variants interacts with the mathematical properties of ratio statistics to systematically inflate gene-level pi_N/pi_S estimates even in the absence of selection. Notably, filtering this rare variation reveals previously masked candidates for selection, including well-characterized antigens such as merozoite surface proteins. This framework provides a foundation for interpreting genomic data in pathogens with high variance in reproductive success.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Presents an integrated bioinformatics pipeline for assembling and calling variants in African Swine Fever Virus genomes, improving reproducibility and accessibility for routine viral genomics but offering minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) is of high concern in porcine livestock across the world due to both the high mortality rates and the trade restrictions imposed on affected regions. Viral genome is large and complex, but genomic analysis is essential for tracing its origin and evolution. Although several bioinformatics tools exist for genome assembly and analysis, no single platform integrates all necessary steps in an accessible and systematic way. In this study the authors developed &#x27;PePApipe&#x27;, a custom-built, user-friendly pipeline that enables rapid, complete, and efficient ASFV genome analysis. It is specifically designed for laboratory professionals with limited bioinformatics experience, requiring only basic command-line knowledge. Starting from raw sequencing data, PePApipe integrates thirteen software tools into one automated workflow, covering quality control and pre-processing of raw reads, denovo genome assembly and variant calling. Programmed in Phyton, it can be executed locally through bash scripts, or using a SLURM protocol for batch processing of multiple samples. The main outputs are the ASFV consensus genome sequence and a file listing its putative variants compared to the selected reference genome. PePApipe classifies generated files into structures folders and produces intermediate files that can be used as inputs for further or parallel analyses; also users can enable or disable specific steps in each particular case. This pipeline is adaptable and complementary to downstream steps such as viral genome annotation or genome visualization. By consolidating all stages of viral genome analysis into a single automated workflow, PePApipe reduces the likelihood of user error and enhances reproducibility and efficiency. This easy-to-use pipeline will facilitate the transition from sequencing to assembly and analysis of viral genomes, ensuring a fast and reliable response to molecular analysis demands. Finally, the pipeline can be easily adapted to the study of other viral species, expanding its application in infectious diseases surveillance.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have been used as cathode materials for aqueous zinc-ion batteries (AZIBs) because of their high working voltage, open channels, and straightforward synthesis. However, the practical deployment of PBAs is severely constrained by the oxygen evolution reaction and water-induced framework degradation. Here, we present a quasi-solid-state &quot;water-in-swelling-clay&quot; electrolyte based on bentonite (BT) clay to confine water within its layered structure, suppressing water activity and broadening the practical electrochemical stability window. When coupled with PBA cathodes, the BT electrolyte suppresses oxygen evolution and mitigates cathode structural distortion, enabling long-cycle life and high-voltage operation. Electrochemical characterizations confirm the effectiveness of the BT electrolyte, enabling high-performance AZIB cycling for over 800 cycles at 0.2 A g-1 with a high operating voltage exceeding 1.9 V. This simple, low-cost, and scalable electrolyte design directly addresses the water-driven failure modes of PBAs and offers a practical route toward durable, high-energy AZIBs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Peptoids, or poly(N-substituted glycines), hold great promise in biomedical applications because of their biocompatibility, precise synthesis via conventional peptide-mimicking methods, and readily tunable side chains, which facilitate the control of hydrophobicity and crystallinity. In the past decade, peptoids have been employed to create well-defined self-assemblies such as vesicles, micelles, sheets, and tubes, which have been scrutinized at the atomic scale using cutting-edge analytical techniques. This review highlights recent advancements in peptoid synthesis strategies and the development of noteworthy one-dimensional or two-dimensional anisotropic self-assemblies, i.e., nanosheets and nanotubes, exhibiting well-ordered molecular arrangements. These anisotropic self-assemblies are formed through the crystallization of peptoid side chains, which can be effortlessly modified via simple synthesis approaches. Moreover, leveraging the protease resistance of peptoids, various biomedical applications are discussed (including phototherapy, enzymatic mimetics, bio-imaging, and biosensing) that capitalize on the unique properties of anisotropic self-assembly.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Polymer-polyoxometalate (POM) systems represent an emergent class of functional hybrid materials. However, the pH-dependent stability of POMs limits their scope in water. We show here that the water-mediated, so-called superchaotropic, binding of α-Keggin POMs to a non-ionic biopolymer, hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), i) selectively stabilizes superchaotropic POMs in water, and ii) enables pH-responsive HPC solutions and hydrogels. Raman and NMR spectroscopy revealed that binding to HPC sterically protects the superchaotropic PW12O403- and SiW12O404- against hydrolysis, extending their stability from acidic to near-neutral pH. In turn, POMs with higher charge, stronger hydration and thus without the ability to bind to HPC, such as H2W12O406-, PW11O397- and SiW11O398-, do not get stabilized. Cloud points, small angle neutron scattering and rotational rheology showed that pH-induced conversion from superchaotropic PW12O403- to non-superchaotropic PW11O397- switches HPC from a bound, crosslinked to an unbound, non-crosslinked state enabling pH-switchable viscosity and gel-sol transitions. Superchaotropic stabilization and pH-switching are proposed as general phenomena in superchaotropic POM/solute systems highlighting the potential of superchaotropicity in aqueous soft materials.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Medicinal chemistry/structural biology study optimizing a selective BPTF bromodomain inhibitor via water-network interactions in cancer cells, with no substantive connection to origins-of-life or astrobiology beyond a generic mention of water.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Bromodomain PHD finger Transcription Factor (BPTF) is an epigenetic regulator implicated in cancer progression. However, despite its oncogenic significance, highly selective and potent inhibitors of the BPTF bromodomain (BRD) with suitable physicochemical properties are lacking. Previously, we reported BZ1, a submicromolar BPTF inhibitor which has off-target activities. Here, we applied comparative structural biology and molecular modeling to design BZ2, a regioisomer of BZ1 with enhanced selectivity for BPTF over other class I bromodomains and class-IV BRDs such as BRD7 and BRD9. Co-crystal structures and computational analyses reveal that differential engagement of water networks and polar interactions drives this selectivity. Functional studies demonstrate that genetic disruption of the BPTF BRD or treatment with BZ2 suppresses neuroblastoma cell growth. With high potency and improved physicochemical properties, BZ2 provides a valuable tool for probing the biology of BPTF and represents a promising starting point for advancing BPTF-targeted drug development.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This paper synthesizes competing models for the prebiotic emergence of RNA—direct chemical synthesis versus prolonged chemical evolution in diverse mixtures—highlighting how each framework motivates different predictions, experimental strategies, and implications for early biomolecular co-evolution on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The origins of biopolymers embody a central question about the origin of life and the nature of chemical sciences. Two conceptually distinct models, direct chemical synthesis and chemical evolution, have been advanced to explain the prebiotic emergence of RNA and other biopolymers, and they motivate different predictions and experimental approaches. In the direct chemical synthesis model, the inherent reactivities of prebiotic compounds on the ancient Earth led to the formation of RNA, which subsequently enabled Darwinian evolution. This model depends on the prebiotic availability of sugars (and their precursors), nucleic acid bases, amino acids, and other chemical species. In this framework, serial and parallel chemical reactions, governed primarily by the intrinsic properties of small-molecule feedstocks, combine stepwise to yield RNA. In a fundamentally different and more recent model, RNA is assumed to have emerged alongside other biopolymers during a prolonged interval of chemical evolution in which complex, diverse molecular ensembles were subject to dynamic and continually shifting selective pressures. In this evolutionary framework, RNA does not arise directly from simple building blocks in a prebiotic milieu but from iterative cycles of diversity generation, selective retention, and chemical transformation within heterogeneous organic mixtures. This model presages deep biological entanglement among different classes of biomolecules. It remains unknown whether direct chemical synthesis, chemical evolution, or some combination of these processes provides a viable prebiotic path to RNA.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Phosphorescent carbon dots act as visible-light triplet sensitizers for [2+2] photocycloadditions, using surface hydrogen-bonding to template unusually high HH-syn diastereoselectivity—an interesting model for how surface-mediated photochemistry could, in principle, bias product distributions in prebiotic-like settings, though not directly focused on origins-of-life chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Light-driven [2+2] cycloaddition offers the most direct route to tetrasubstituted cyclobutanes, but controlling diastereoselectivity remains a fundamental challenge: solution-phase reactions favor HH-anti products, while the synthetically valuable HH-syn diastereomers require solid-state preorganization, supramolecular templating, or cadmium-based quantum dot photocatalysts. Here we show that phosphorescent carbon dots serve as visible-light photocatalysts for homo- and hetero-intermolecular [2+2] cycloadditions via triplet–triplet energy transfer, the first demonstration of carbon dots as triplet-energy donors in organic synthesis. Hydrogen-bonding interactions between substrates and the carboxylate-rich catalyst surface enable up to &gt;33:1 diastereoselectivity for HH-syn cyclobutanes. This surface-mediated control extends to multiple hydrogen-bond donors, including carboxylic acids and amides. The reaction tolerates diverse functional groups, scales to gram quantities with sustained catalytic activity over 300 hours, establishing earth-abundant carbon dots as practical photocatalysts for stereoselective synthesis.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Genes can evolve through changes at their DNA, RNA, or protein levels. However, because these changes are measured using distinct and often incomparable metrics, their relative contributions to genic evolution remain unclear. Here, we address this challenge by developing a standardized framework for comparing evolutionary divergence in protein-coding sequences, multi-tissue expression profiles, and protein structures. Application of this approach to data from Drosophila, rodents, primates, and Arabidopsis reveals substantial variation in divergence patterns across taxa, with only sequence divergence matching expectations based on evolutionary theory. Moreover, sequences evolve slowest and protein structures fastest in all taxa, consistent with the idea that higher levels of biological organization are closer proxies for the functions on which selection acts. Yet, weak correlations among divergence measures suggest that targets of selection vary across genes, perhaps depending on their functions. Indeed, few genes exhibit similar evolutionary patterns across all three levels, and different functions are enriched in genes with low or high divergence in protein-coding sequences, gene expression profiles, and protein structures. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that evolutionary targets of genes depend on their functions, shedding light on how selection shapes different levels of biological organization across taxa.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> It is currently debated whether Earth system models (ESMs) can reproduce observation-based long-term changes in global and regional deoxygenation rates. Both models and observations include uncertainties, which must be considered when evaluating their consistency. Based on 14 ESMs and 6 observational datasets, the models’ climatological annual mean oxygen matches observations well near the surface. However, significant biases remain in the tropics and in the thermocline. Based on the same set of models and three time-varying observation-based datasets, the models tend to underestimate deoxygenation trends from 1965 to 2014, except for the North Atlantic basin. However, the small number of observational datasets limits this conclusion. One dataset appears to significantly underestimate deoxygenation due to sparse data coverage. This review highlights the need for improvements in model process representations and the development of more observation-based, quality-controlled datasets to better constrain and interpret oxygen changes in the ocean. ▪ Uncertainties of dissolved oxygen field in CMIP6 ESMs and observational reconstructions are quantified. ▪ The ESMs can skillfully reproduce long-term average oxygen near the surface, but challenges remain in the thermocline and tropics. ▪ The ESMs underestimates the deoxygenation trends except for the North Atlantic basin.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Proposes a planet–host ratio relation to unify Roman microlensing and transit exoplanet demographics, improving forward-modeling of planet populations but with limited direct relevance to origins-of-life or biosignature science.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2506.24004v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The NASA Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (Roman) will be the first survey able to detect large numbers of both cold and hot exoplanets across Galactic distances: $\sim$1,400 cold exoplanets via microlensing and $\sim$200,000 hot, transiting planets. Differing sensitivities to planet bulk properties between the microlensing and transit methods require relations like a planet mass--radius relation (MRR) to mediate. We propose using instead a planet--host {\em ratio} relation (PHRR) to couple directly microlensing and transit observables in demographic forward-modelling simulations. Unlike the MRR, a PHRR uses parameters that are always measured and so can potentially leverage the full Roman exoplanet sample. Using 908 confirmed exoplanets from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, we show that transit depth, $\delta$, and planet--host mass ratio, $q$, obey a PHRR that is continuous over all planet scales. The PHRR is improved by including orbital period, $P$, and host effective temperature, $T_{\star}$. We compare several candidate PHRRs of the form $\delta (q,T_\star, P)$, with the Bayesian Information Criterion favouring power-law dependence on $T_\star$ and $P$, and broken power-law dependence on $q$. The break in $q$ itself depends on $T_\star$, as do the power-law slopes in $q$ either side of the break. The favoured PHRR achieves a fairly uniform $50\%$ relative precision in $\delta$ for all $q$. Approximately $5\%$ of the sample has a transit depth that is strongly over-predicted by the PHRR; around half of these are associated with large stars ($R_\star &gt; 2.5 \, R_{\odot}$) potentially subject to Malmquist bias.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08306v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The small number of impact craters found on Titan suggests that its surface is relatively young. Previous work estimated its surface age to be between 200 and 1000 Myr. This estimate, however, is based on crater scaling laws for water and sand, which are not representative of the composition of Titan&#x27;s icy surface. Titan&#x27;s surface is likely composed of water ice, methane clathrates, or a combination of both. Here, we perform impact simulations for impactors of various sizes that strike an icy target with a 0-15 km thick methane clathrate cap layer. We derive new crater scaling laws based on our numerical results, and find that Titan&#x27;s surface age is 300-340 Myr, assuming heliocentric impactors and surface clathrates. This age, which represents the crater retention age, indicates a relatively youthful surface, suggesting that active endogenic and/or exogenic processes have recently reshaped Titan&#x27;s surface.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08390v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The next great leap in Martian exploration will be the return of samples to Earth. To ensure the maximum scientific return from studying these samples, the development and utilisation of nondestructive analytical techniques are essential to enable early three-dimensional characterisation of their interiors. Neutron computed tomography is a powerful method in this context: it is highly sensitive to hydrogen and complements the more conventional X-ray computed tomography. Because the distribution and nature of hydrous phases are central to understanding the habitability, the climatic and geological evolution, and potential biosignatures of Mars, identifying hydrogenbearing phases in Martian crustal rocks is of particular importance. Using the only Martian crustal material available on Earth, the NWA 7034 meteorite and its pairs, we show that combined neutron and X-ray computed tomography enables non-destructive sample-wide mapping of hydrogen and reveals the distribution and petrographic contexts of hydrous phases. We identify hydrogen-rich iron oxyhydroxides within ancient igneous clasts, forming a macroscopic mineralogical water reservoir within the meteorite. These alteration assemblages closely resemble those observed in samples collected by the Perseverance rover in Jezero crater, where hydrated iron oxyhydroxides are also present. This similarity suggests that such phases may represent a widespread near-surface water reservoir on early Mars.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07983v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Geologic records of cosmogenic 10Be are sensitive to changes in the radiation environment with time. Recent works suggest there are periods when the Sun encountered massive cold clouds which compressed the heliosphere to within Earth&#x27;s orbit. This would expose Earth to increased galactic cosmic rays and MeV-energy particles of heliospheric origin. We model 10Be production in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere during possible cold cloud encounters, and estimate their detectability in marine records of variable temporal resolution. We find that an AU-scale cold cloud encounter can be detected using ocean sediment measurements of 10Be if Earth spends time inside the compressed heliosphere. For typical relative speeds between the Sun and local interstellar clouds, this translates to a crossing time of ~100 years. A cloud must have an extension on the scale of parsecs to tens-of-parsecs (crossing time 0.1-1 Myr) to be detectable through 10Be measurements in iron-manganese crusts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08507v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We report new constraints on the vertical distribution of sulfuric acid vapor in the Venusian atmosphere, derived from a refined analysis of radio occultation (RO) data. The method estimates the power spectral density (PSD) of the received signal to recover both the signal intensity and the Doppler shift. The received signal power is estimated at 1-sec cadence which enhances the sensitivity and detection of the signal at lower altitudes of Venus, even in regions of high atmospheric opacity. After correcting total attenuation for refractive losses, absorption by known microwave absorbers is removed, leaving a residual signal attributable to sulfuric acid vapor. Two different methods of estimating the absorption due to Sulfur Dioxide have been presented, including one which incorporates in-situ data, which should better constrain the sulfuric acid vapor abundance below the clouds. Retrieved profiles for altitudes of 40 - 50 km reveal an increasing vapor abundance to more than 10 ppm below the clouds, and a sharp decline above 50 km in line with the expected saturation profile. These measurements agree with current models of the Venusian cloud structure and composition, and demonstrate that RO data, when coupled with optimized spectral analysis, can yield quantitative constraints on trace absorbers in optically thick atmospheres.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2505.00880v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: At visible wavelengths, Venus appears serene and pale-yellow, but since the 1920s, observers have noted high-contrast features in the ultraviolet. These features track the about 4-day superrotation of the upper cloud deck and vary widely over time and space. The identity of the UV absorber(s), active between at least 280 and 500 nm, remains unknown, as no proposed candidate fully matches all observational data. From remote observations of Venus, and accounting for light scattering by sub-micrometer droplets, we modeled the 365-455 nm absorbance per cm of the bulk liquids forming Venus&#x27;s clouds. Assuming a uniform distribution in mode 1 and 2 particles across a 6 km layer below the cloud top at 65 km, we constrain the bulk absorbance with a peak at A375 nm is 2942 per cm. This extremely high absorbance implies the presence of a highly efficient absorber, for example, conjugated organics, at relatively high concentration, e.g., approx. 25 g/L for porphyrin-type pigments with molar absorption coefficient of approx. 100,000 per mole per cm. Inorganic absorbers, typically below 10,000 per mole per cm, would either need to constitute a large portion of the aerosols or still not be sufficiently light-absorbing, even in pure form. We emphasize that all candidate absorbers must be evaluated against Venus&#x27;s reflectance curve using (i) known molar absorption coefficients, (ii) realistic atmospheric distributions, and (iii) appropriate particle size distributions. The upcoming Rocket Lab mission will test the hypothesis of organics in Venus&#x27;s clouds.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08783v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Biased sampling in molecular dynamics simulations overcomes timescale limitations and delivers free-energy landscapes, essential to understand complex atomistic phenomena. However, when applied across diverse systems and processes, biasing protocols often require time- and resource-consuming fine-tuning. In search for robustness, we boost a prominent biasing method, Umbrella Sampling. To estimate the value of an integral, i.e., the free energy, our Bayesian Umbrella Quadrature (BUQ) method iteratively selects gradient samples, i.e., bias locations, that most reduce the posterior integral variance based on a noise-tolerant Gaussian process model, which also effectively interpolates between samples. We validate the method for a conformational change in a small peptide, a water-to-ice phase transition, and a substitution chemical reaction; obtaining excellent accuracies and speedups. To ease adoption of this more automated and universal free-energy method, we interface BUQ with wide-spread simulation packages and share hyperparametrization guidelines.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08591v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We present independent polarimetric observations of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, including the first near-infrared polarimetric measurements. Using imaging polarimeters, we measured the degree of linear polarization from the visible RC band (0.64 {\mu}m) to the near-infrared KS band (2.25 {\mu}m), and investigated its dependence on solar phase angle (polarization phase curve; PPC) and wavelength (polarization color curve; PCC). We confirm that the PPC of 3I/ATLAS differs significantly from those of typical Solar System comets, showing an unusually large polarization amplitude. This PPC shows no significant change in the RC band across perihelion passage, despite the perihelion lying within the water snow line. This indicates that the unusual polarimetric behavior of 3I/ATLAS is unlikely to be driven by transient volatile activity, but instead reflects intrinsic optical properties of refractory dust particles. The PCC increases with wavelength over 0.6-1.2 {\mu}m and peaks at 1.5-2.0 {\mu}m, suggesting that the dominant scattering units are dust aggregates composed of submicron-sized monomers, broadly consistent with interstellar dust and solar-system cometary aggregates. Taken together, our results indicate that 3I/ATLAS preserves polarimetric properties characteristic of a primitive cometary planetesimal formed in another planetary system, with a refractory dust composition that differs from that typically observed among Solar System comets, despite sharing a similar size scale of the aggregate building blocks.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08397v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Transit spectroscopy is a powerful tool for probing atmospheric structures of exoplanets. Accurately accounting for the effects of aerosols is key to reconstructing atmospheric properties from transit spectra, yet this remains a significant challenge. To advance this effort, it is invaluable to examine the spectral features of well-characterized planetary atmospheres. Here, we synthesize empirical transit spectra of Mars across different seasons based on data from the NOMAD&#x27;s Solar Occultation channel onboard ExoMars/TGO, which operates at wavelengths of 0.2-0.65 and 2-4 micron. In the generated empirical transit spectra, the atmosphere below 25 km is found to be largely opaque due to the presence of micron-sized dust and water ice clouds, both of which substantially weaken spectral features. The spectra exhibit CO2 absorption features at 2.7-2.8 micron and signatures of sub-micron-sized mesospheric water ice clouds around 3.1 micron, accompanied by a continuum slope. The amplitudes of these spectral features are found to vary with the Martian seasons, where the dust storms weaken the CO2 signatures and strengthen the water ice features, which serve as potential indicators of a dusty planet like Mars. If TRAPPIST-1f possessed a Mars-like atmospheric structure, both CO2 and water ice features would be detectable at a noise level of 3 ppm, a level likely beyond current observational capabilities. Nevertheless, the 3.1 micron feature produced by sub-micron-sized mesospheric water ice clouds offers a novel avenue for characterizing the atmospheres of habitable-zone exoplanets.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08606v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We study an open quantum spin chain with non-reciprocal dissipation using a theoretical approach known as time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble. In the regime of weak dissipation the system is fully characterized by its rapidity distribution and we derive a closed set of coupled differential equations governing their time evolution. We check the accuracy of this theory by benchmarking the results against numerical simulations. Using this framework we are able to compute both the magnetization density and current dynamics, identifying some relations between the two. The problem of the anomalous power-law exponents identified in a previous work is discussed. Our work constitutes a theoretical approach that is able to describe the physics of non-reciprocal open quantum spin chains beyond analyses based on non-interacting fermions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08576v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The globalization problem arises when local tensor fields possess a given property (such as being symplectic or Poisson) but cannot be consistently extended to a global object due to incompatibilities on chart overlaps. A notable instance occurs in locally conformal analysis, where local representatives coincide only up to conformal factors. The locally conformal approach not only enables the definition of novel and rich geometric structures but also provides Hamiltonian formulations for irreversible systems, yielding physically meaningful dynamical consequences. While extensively studied for symplectic, cosymplectic, and Poisson geometries, its systematic extension to multi-Hamiltonian settings remains largely unexplored. In this work, we investigate locally conformally Nambu--Poisson and locally conformally generalized Poisson manifolds, showing that these structures naturally induce Nambu--Jacobi and generalized Jacobi manifolds, respectively. From a dynamical point of view, we construct Hamiltonian-type evolution equations, and for locally conformal $3$-Nambu structures, we introduce locally conformal bi-Hamiltonian systems. The resulting dynamics are particularly suitable for modeling irreversible multi-Hamiltonian processes, as they generally do not preserve the system&#x27;s energy. Collectively, this work provides a unified framework for understanding both the geometric structures and Hamiltonian dynamics of classical, Nambu--Poisson, and generalized Poisson manifolds within a locally conformal context.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08243v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Topology provides a unifying framework for understanding robust transport through protected edge states arising from nontrivial wavenumber topology. Extending these concepts to active matter, however, remains largely unexplored experimentally, with realizations limited to systems composed of chiral active particles. Here, we realize topological edge states in dense bacterial suspension, which represents a prototypical active matter system, using microfabricated geometrical structures with nontrivial wavenumber topology. Inspired by previous theoretical studies, we constructed a directional kagome network composed of ratchet-shaped channels that induce unidirectional bacterial flow. In this network, we found clear edge localization of bacterial density. A steady-state analysis based on the bacterial transport model and experimentally measured velocity field reveals how the characteristic collective flow generates edge localization. The model also uncovers the topological origin of the observed edge states. By tuning the geometry of the microfabricated networks, we identified directional channel design and network chirality as the key design features essential for the emergence of the edge state. Our results pave the way for establishing a control and design principle of topological transport in such active matter systems.</p>

In contrast to the generally accepted empirical belief that an integrable system yields no kinetic theory, we derive and validate a non-trivial wave kinetic equation (WKE) for the KB system with a non-zero interaction coefficient on the four-wave resonant manifold. This WKE is non-homogeneous in nature due to the non-homogeneity in the dispersion relation of the KB system; however, approximate Kolomogrov-Zakharov (KZ) solutions can be derived in a novel way under certain approximations. We numerically verify the theoretical findings in two cases: (i) In free-evolution cases, although the discrete (nonlinear) spectrum remains unchanged as guaranteed by an integrable system&#x27;s isospectrality, an initial arbitrary wavenumber spectrum quickly evolves into a thermo-equilibrium state, demonstrating the kinetic aspect of the system; (ii) in forced-dissipated cases, we find stationary power-law spectra that agree with the theoretical predictions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07937v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis formulates time evolution of operators through Lanczos coefficients. In practice, however, numerical instability and memory cost limit the number of coefficients that can be computed exactly. In response to these challenges, the standard approach relies on fitting early coefficients to asymptotic forms, but such procedures can miss subleading, history-dependent structures in the coefficients that subsequently affect reconstructed observables. In this work, we treat the Lanczos coefficients as a causal time sequence and introduce a transformer-based model to autoregressively predict future Lanczos coefficients from short prefixes. For both classical and quantum systems, our machine-learning model outperforms asymptotic fits, in both coefficient extrapolation and physical observable reconstruction, by achieving an order-of-magnitude reduction in error. Our model also transfers across system sizes: it can be trained on smaller systems and then be used to extrapolate coefficients on a larger system without retraining. By probing the learned attention patterns and performing targeted attention ablations, we identify which portions of the coefficient history are most influential for accurate forecasts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08577v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: RNA polymerase (RNAP) is a molecular machine that reads information encoded in the base sequence of a DNA template while producing mechanical motion (transcription elongation; forward/backward stepping; backtracking) through chemical-potential differences of nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) and fluctuations under external conditions. A prior work formulated a mismatch in free-energy accounting as the involvement of a term originating from genetic information (e.g.\ $k_BT\log P(N)$), and interpreted RNAP as a Maxwell&#x27;s demon / Szilard-engine-like device that converts information into motion. However, in information thermodynamics, the bookkeeping of information and dissipation can depend on how one partitions the composite system into a device and a target (observer/observed labeling).</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a neuroevolution algorithm (NEVO-GSPT) for efficiently evolving compact neural network architectures using geometric semantic operators, with no direct relevance to origins-of-life or astrobiology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08657v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Evolving neural network architectures is a computationally demanding process. Traditional methods often require an extensive search through large architectural spaces and offer limited understanding of how structural modifications influence model behavior. This paper introduces \gls{ngspt}, a novel Neuroevolution algorithm based on two key innovations. First, we adapt geometric semantic operators~(GSOs) from genetic programming to neural network evolution, ensuring that architectural changes produce predictable effects on network semantics within a unimodal error surface. Second, we introduce a novel operator (DGSM) that enables controlled reduction of network size, while maintaining the semantic properties of~GSOs. Unlike traditional approaches, \gls{ngspt}&#x27;s efficient evaluation mechanism, which only requires computing the semantics of newly added components, allows for efficient population-based training, resulting in a comprehensive exploration of the search space at a fraction of the computational cost. Experimental results on four regression benchmarks show that \gls{ngspt} consistently evolves compact neural networks that achieve performance comparable to or better than established methods in the literature, such as standard neural networks, SLIM-GSGP, TensorNEAT, and SLM.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06272v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The origin of life poses a problem of combinatorial feasibility: How can persistent functional organization arise in exponentially branching assembly spaces when unguided exploration behaves as a memoryless random walk? We show that nonlinear threshold-cascade dynamics in connected interaction networks provide a minimal, substrate-agnostic mechanism that can soften this obstruction. Below a critical connectivity threshold, cascades die out locally and structured input-output response mappings remain sparse and transient-a &quot;functional desert&quot; in which accumulation is dynamically unsupported. Near the critical percolation threshold, system-spanning cascades emerge, enabling persistent and discriminative functional responses. We illustrate this transition using a minimal toy model and generalize the argument to arbitrary networked systems. Also near criticality, cascades introduce structural and functional persistence, directional bias, and weak dynamical path-dependence into otherwise memoryless exploration, allowing biased accumulation over short coherence timescales. This connectivity-driven transition-functional percolation-requires only generic ingredients: interacting units, nonlinear thresholds, influence transmission, and non-zero coherence times. The mechanism does not explain specific biochemical pathways, but it identifies a necessary dynamical regime in which structured functional organization can emerge and persist, providing a physical foundation for how combinatorial feasibility barriers can be crossed through network dynamics alone.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08649v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In transitions between different environmental settings, a molecular system inevitably undergoes a range of detectable changes, and the ability to accurately simulate such responses, e.g., in the form of shifts to molecular energies, remains an important challenge across physical chemistry. Based on an exact decomposition of total energies from Kohn--Sham density functional theory in a basis of spatially localized molecular orbitals, the present work outlines a robust protocol for sampling the effect of solvation within homogeneous condensed phases by focusing on perturbations to local electronic structures only. We report chemically intuitive results for binding energies of water, ethanol, and acetonitrile that all display fast convergence with respect to the bulk size. Results stay largely invariant with respect to the choice of basis set while reflecting differences in density functional approximations, and our protocol thus allows for a physically sound and efficient estimation of general effects related to bulk solvation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08243v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Topology provides a unifying framework for understanding robust transport through protected edge states arising from nontrivial wavenumber topology. Extending these concepts to active matter, however, remains largely unexplored experimentally, with realizations limited to systems composed of chiral active particles. Here, we realize topological edge states in dense bacterial suspension, which represents a prototypical active matter system, using microfabricated geometrical structures with nontrivial wavenumber topology. Inspired by previous theoretical studies, we constructed a directional kagome network composed of ratchet-shaped channels that induce unidirectional bacterial flow. In this network, we found clear edge localization of bacterial density. A steady-state analysis based on the bacterial transport model and experimentally measured velocity field reveals how the characteristic collective flow generates edge localization. The model also uncovers the topological origin of the observed edge states. By tuning the geometry of the microfabricated networks, we identified directional channel design and network chirality as the key design features essential for the emergence of the edge state. Our results pave the way for establishing a control and design principle of topological transport in such active matter systems.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Direct optical measurements reveal unexpectedly long-ranged like-charge attraction (electrosolvation) between colloids—including DNA- and lipid-coated particles—suggesting solvent–interface physics may enable strong self-assembly relevant to prebiotic aggregation and protocell-scale organization.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2508.14652v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: In solution, electrically like-charged particles can experience a strong and long-ranged attraction that leads to the formation of stable, slowly reorganizing clusters. The attractive force underpinning this spontaneous organization process has been shown to depend on both the sign of charge of the particle and the nature of the solvent medium. The origin of the attraction has been ascribed to the preferential orientation of solvent molecules at the object-electrolyte interface. Here, we use optical imaging to directly measure the spatial profile of the potential of mean force between isolated pairs of charged microspheres. Working with particles carrying a variety of surface chemistries we find that the range of the electrosolvation attraction is substantially longer than previously held. In particular we show that particles carrying strongly anionic surface coatings composed of DNA or phospholipid bilayers display long-range attraction. We further find that the length scale governing the decay of the attractive force can depend on the properties of the interacting particles. This contrasts with the canonical expectation that the screening length governing the interaction of charged particles in solution depends exclusively on the properties of the intervening electrolyte medium. The observations point to significant departures from current thinking, and the likely need for a model of interactions that accounts for the molecular nature of the solvent, its interfacial behaviour, and spatial correlations. Finally, a strong and long-ranged attraction mediated by anionic matter constituting lipid membranes and chromatin could carry far-reaching implications for biological organization and structure formation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08783v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Biased sampling in molecular dynamics simulations overcomes timescale limitations and delivers free-energy landscapes, essential to understand complex atomistic phenomena. However, when applied across diverse systems and processes, biasing protocols often require time- and resource-consuming fine-tuning. In search for robustness, we boost a prominent biasing method, Umbrella Sampling. To estimate the value of an integral, i.e., the free energy, our Bayesian Umbrella Quadrature (BUQ) method iteratively selects gradient samples, i.e., bias locations, that most reduce the posterior integral variance based on a noise-tolerant Gaussian process model, which also effectively interpolates between samples. We validate the method for a conformational change in a small peptide, a water-to-ice phase transition, and a substitution chemical reaction; obtaining excellent accuracies and speedups. To ease adoption of this more automated and universal free-energy method, we interface BUQ with wide-spread simulation packages and share hyperparametrization guidelines.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07968v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We study the theoretical problem of synthesizing multiple DNA strands under spatial constraints, motivated by large-scale DNA synthesis technologies. In this setting, strands are arranged in an array and synthesized according to a fixed global synthesis sequence, with the restriction that at most one strand per row may be synthesized in any synthesis cycle. We focus on the basic case of two strands in a single row and analyze the expected completion time under this row-constrained model. By decomposing the process into a Markov chain, we derive analytical upper and lower bounds on the expected synthesis time. We show that a simple laggard-first policy achieves an asymptotic expected completion time of (q+3)L/2 for any alphabet of size q, and that no online policy without look-ahead can asymptotically outperform this bound. For the binary case, we show that allowing a single-symbol look-ahead strictly improves performance, yielding an asymptotic expected completion time of 7L/3. Finally, we present a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the optimal offline schedule for any fixed pair of sequences. Together, these results provide the first analytical bounds for synthesis under spatial constraints and lay the groundwork for future studies of optimal synthesis policies in such settings.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08309v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Ion transport underlies the operation of biological ion channels and governs the performance of electrochemical energy-storage devices. A long-standing anomaly is that smaller alkali metal ions, such as Li$^+$, migrate more slowly in water than larger ions, in apparent violation of the Stokes-Einstein relation. This breakdown is conventionally attributed to dielectric friction, a collective drag force arising from electrostatic interactions between a drifting ion and its surrounding solvent. Here, combining nanopore transport measurements over electric fields spanning several orders of magnitude with molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the time-averaged electrostatic force on a migrating ion is not a drag force but a net driving force. By contrasting charged ions with neutral particles, we reveal that ionic charge introduces additional Lorentzian peaks in the frequency-dependent friction coefficient. These peaks originate predominantly from short-range Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions within the first hydration layer and represent additional channels for energy dissipation, strongest for Li$^+$ and progressively weaker for Na$^+$ and K$^+$. Our results demonstrate that electrostatic interactions primarily act to tighten the local hydration structure, thereby amplifying short-range LJ interactions rather than directly opposing ion motion. This microscopic mechanism provides a unified physical explanation for the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation in aqueous ion transport.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.08370v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The coupled Arctic system is in rapid transition and is set to undergo further dramatic changes over the coming decades. These changes will lead most likely to an ice-free ocean in summer, expected before mid-century. The Arctic will become more strongly influenced by atmospheric and oceanographic processes characteristic of mid-latitudes, increasing the prevalence of contaminants and new biological species. This ongoing transition of the Arctic to a new state necessitates systematic monitoring of all sentinels (variables that make an essential contribution to characterizing the Earth&#x27;s state) to improve our understanding of the system, enhance forecasting and support knowledge-based decisions. Here, we describe a sustained multi-decadal observation program to be implemented on the Tara Polar Station between 2026 and 2046. The monitoring program is designed as a series of year-long drift expeditions, called Tara Polaris, in the central Arctic Ocean, covering all seasons. The multidisciplinary data will bridge ecological, geochemical, biological, and physical parameters and processes in the atmosphere, sea ice and ocean. In addition, data collected with consistent methodologies over a 20-year period will make it possible to distinguish long-term trends from seasonal and interannual variability. In this paper, we discuss specific measurement challenges in each compartment (i.e., atmosphere, sea ice and ocean) along key sentinels and the most pressing scientific questions to be addressed. The expected outcomes of the Tara Polaris program will enable us to understand and quantify the main feedbacks of the coupled Arctic system, with their seasonal and interannual trends and spatial variability.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Radiation induced gastrointestinal mucositis (GIM) is a severe complication of radiotherapy that compromises patient quality of life and treatment efficacy. This study assessed the therapeutic potential and molecular mechanisms of two forms of herbal extracts, Compound Kushen Powder (CKP) and Compound Kushen Injection (CKI) in a rat model of GIM. Administration of either CKP or CKI to irradiated animals significantly reduced the severity of GIM symptoms. Transcriptomic analysis of jejunum and colon mucosa identified candidate mechanisms as well as common pathways between CKP and CKI. CKP modulated innate immune activation and inflammatory signalling, affecting genes such as Socs3 and Tlr4, while CKI promoted tissue repair and oxidative stress resistance through genes including Osm, Epha2, and Stat3. However, both forms of herbal extract enhanced stress response and stimulus regulation in our GIM model. These findings reveal common mechanisms shared by CKP and CKI that suppress symptoms of radiation induced GIM, along with extract specific effects on distinct pathways, acting on different set of genes.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Using CRISPR screens and metabolic tracing, this study shows that lysosomal glycoprotein breakdown (via aspartylglucosaminidase and M6P sorting) supplies and shapes N-glycans covalently attached to small RNAs (glycoRNAs), revealing a modern metabolic route linking RNA modification to glycan recycling with indirect relevance to OoL themes of RNA chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> GlycoRNAs, small non-coding RNAs covalently linked to N-glycans, reveal an unexpected intersection between RNA biology and glycosylation, with potential roles in immunity and cell-cell communication. The origins and biogenesis of their glycans remain unclear. Using CRISPR-Cas9 screening, metabolic labeling, and lysosome-targeted proteomics, we reconfirm canonical N-glycosylation enzymes (STT3A/B) and identify components of the mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) lysosomal sorting pathway (GNPTAB, M6PR) as essential contributors. Strikingly, lysosomal aspartylglucosaminidase (AGA) acts as a rate-limiting regulator, linking glycoprotein catabolism to glycoRNA formation. Loss of AGA collapses both abundance and diversity of RNA-linked N-glycans, while pulse-chase tracing shows glycoprotein-derived glycans are repurposed for RNA glycosylation. These findings position lysosomes as active participants in RNA modification and define glycoRNA biogenesis as a metabolically integrated process.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study builds a computational and experimental framework to identify and validate short linear motifs in secreted Toxoplasma gondii proteins that mediate host–pathogen interactions, yielding a large motif catalog and confirming TRAF6-binding motifs in RON10 and GRA15.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pathogens infect hosts by interacting with host proteins and exploiting their functions to their advantage. Short linear motifs, small functional regions within intrinsically disordered protein regions, are common mediators of host-pathogen protein interactions. While motifs have been more extensively studied in viruses and bacteria, the extent to which eukaryotic unicellular parasites use motifs during infection remains unexplored. Toxoplasma gondii is a widespread intracellular Apicomplexan parasite capable of infecting all warm-blooded animals and invading any of their nucleated cells. Toxoplasma&#x27;s secreted proteins are key in interacting with host proteins during infection, making them potential sources for motifs. To highlight the role of motifs in Toxoplasma gondii infection, we curated 20 known motif instances in Toxoplasma proteins from the scientific literature. To identify more motifs in Toxoplasma secreted proteins, we developed a computational pipeline that annotates putative motif matches with structural and functional features. Through this approach, we identified a set of 27,832 motif matches in 296 secreted proteins. We highlight strategies for further prioritisation of likely functional motif matches by focusing on integrin motifs, degrons and TRAF6-binding motifs. We subjected four predicted TRAF6-binding motifs to experimental validation, supporting the predicted motifs in the Toxoplasma proteins RON10 and GRA15. Our motif predictions provide a valuable resource for generating hypotheses and designing experiments to study infection mechanisms. The characterisation of motifs in Toxoplasma will be key to understanding the molecular principles underlying its broad host range and more comprehensive Apicomplexan infection strategies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Retrotransposons are mobile, repetitive DNA sequences that are ubiquitous across eukaryotes and widely recognised as key drivers of both gene and genome evolution. The CR1 group of retrotransposons is thought to have been present in the most recent common ancestor of chordates ~560 mya, and is the dominant retrotransposon in the majority of chordate species. The advent of long-read sequencing technologies has enabled the assembly of high-quality genomes from representatives of almost all major chordate orders, enabling comparative analysis with deeply divergent species. To better understand the composition of CR1-group elements (CGEs) in chordates, we systematically characterised full-length, recently active transposable elements across representative species from every available extant order of chordate. Our analysis uncovered previously unknown phylogenetic relationships of CGEs within and between species and has pushed back the origin of certain CR1-group subclades by tens of millions of years. Additionally, entirely novel elements with no close relatives in existing databases were uncovered within several of the species analysed. We also detected numerous putative horizontal transfer events, many of which had not been previously documented. Overall, this investigation has provided the first chordate-wide analysis of an element that is historically understudied yet plays a pivotal role in genome biology and evolution.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chagas disease is a major protozoan infection in the Americas, causing approximately 12,000 deaths each year. It is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, and can be transmitted transplacentally, leading to congenital Chagas disease, a silent route that carries substantial risk for newborns. However, the mechanisms underlying congenital Chagas transmission are poorly understood. Here, we evaluated whether T. cruzi infection alters the placental microenvironment and systemic physiology, and whether such alterations are associated with congenital transmission. Integrating bulk RNA sequencing, proteomics, and spatial transcriptomics, we show that T. cruzi infection elicits profound molecular remodeling in both placenta and peripheral blood, regardless of transmission status. Transmitting mothers exhibit a distinct transcriptional signature enriched for inflammatory and tissue-remodeling pathways. Notably, peripheral blood profiles mirrored some placental alterations. A panel of inflammatory serum proteins showed promising predictive potential for transmission risk, with implications for prenatal monitoring. Together, these findings support a fundamental shift in the conceptual framework of congenital Chagas disease, from a transmission-centered model to one that recognizes infection-driven placental damage as a pathological spectrum and identifies peripheral blood as a promising, non-invasive source of predictive biomarkers for adverse pregnancy outcomes. This framework motivates the further application of single-cell-resolution approaches to refine models of congenital Chagas pathogenesis and the systematic analysis of maternal peripheral blood during pregnancy to enable early risk stratification and the development of predictive tools for adverse outcomes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Replication restart pathways reinitiate DNA replication processes following their premature termination. In Escherichia coli, this essential process begins with the regulated assembly of the primosome complex, comprising the PriA, PriB, and DnaT proteins, onto an abandoned replication fork. Here, we present two distinct primosome structures. One represents an intermediate stage in primosome assembly with a single DnaT C-terminal domain (DnaTCTD) bound to PriA/PriB/DNA. The second captures the mature primosome, in which filamentation of multiple DnaTCTD molecules catalyzes the handoff of the single-stranded DNA lagging strand from PriB to DnaT. The DnaT N-terminal domain forms a separate, independent oligomer in the mature structure. Taken together, our results detail the molecular mechanisms underlying replication restart initiation and regulation and suggest an unexpected mechanistic similarity between DnaT and the canonical initiator protein DnaA.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Dysfunctional autophagy is connected to multiple diseases. Withaferin-A, a biologically active withanolide, has been shown to impair autophagy in the breast cancer cell line, MCF-7; however, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here while uncovering the mechanism, it was found that treatment of MCF-7 cells with WA declines Beclin1 protein synthesis by restricting association of its mRNA to polysomes with no significant reduction in its mRNA level. Reporter assay established that WA-treatment enhanced the expression level of mature miR-20a which directly interacts with the 3-UTR of beclin1 mRNA. RNA affinity chromatography revealed association of mRNA stabilizing protein, HuR with the 3-UTR of beclin1 mRNA. Additionally, co-immunoprecipitation assay determined the interactions of GW182, an essential component of GW-body and Ago2, a crucial member of miRNA related silencing complex (RISC) with the 3-UTR of beclin1 mRNA. In parallel, it was found that knocking down of HuR eliminates the interaction of GW182 with beclin1 3-UTR, while the association of miRNA (Ago2) remains unaffected. These results suggested simultaneous association of HuR, GW182 and microRNA with beclin1 mRNA which could be pivotal for sequestration of beclin1 mRNA in GW-bodies. Thus, our findings culminated in identifying an unconventional mechanism of regulation of Beclin1 expression by the dual interplay between hsa-miR-20a and HuR during WA-induced impaired autophagy in MCF-7 cells.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> HERMES is a large-scale sequence-to-function foundation model that learns an interpretable regulatory “vocabulary” and enhancer–promoter interaction grammar to predict cell-type-specific gene expression, offering general genomics insights but limited direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Deciphering the comprehensive regulatory code encoded in the genomic sequence remains a central challenge in functional genomics, requiring a paradigm shift from descriptive annotations to a mechanistic understanding of transcriptional regulation. Here, we introduce HERMES (Hierarchical Encoding of Regulatory Mechanisms and Expression Syntax), a framework that progressively defines a fundamental sequence vocabulary and parses gene expression syntax into transparent biological insights for the complex regulatory genome. Specifically, we trained a foundational sequence-to-function model on a massive compendium of 137,127 functional genomics profiles spanning diverse biochemical marks and cellular conditions, including DNA methylation, TF binding, polymerase binding, histone marks, chromatin accessibility and RNA expression across various tissues, cell lines and cell types. By harnessing the high-fidelity sequence representations, we established a context-specific regulatory vocabulary comprising 40 distinct sequence classes and fine-grained subclusters spanning the entire genome. Interrogating this vocabulary revealed the sequence determinants of diverse promoters and tissue-specific enhancers, and identified a robust promoter class specific to housekeeping genes, driven by ETS, YY1 and CCAAT motifs. To further decode transcriptional regulation, HERMES was leveraged to predict cell-type-specific gene expression and the enhancer perturbation effects. Extensive evaluations confirmed that the cis-regulatory elements and their interactions were captured to predict gene expression underlying different cellular conditions, and simultaneously revealed divergent enhancer dependencies between housekeeping genes (HKGs) and highly variable genes (HVGs). Ultimately, we distilled the complex sequence-to-function model into a biologically interpretable rulebook of Enhancer-Promoter interaction grammar. Synthesizing all the insights, we propose a unified compatibility model, where HKGs utilize a strong-promoter architecture for high-output expression, while HVGs depend on a context-dependent syntax driven by compatible promoters and enhancers. In summary, HERMES bridges the gap between predictive modeling and biological mechanism, transforming sequence representations into a comprehensive functional encyclopedia and a quantitative grammar of the complex regulatory genome.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> UniWave is a machine-learning sequence-encoding framework that transforms nucleic acid sequences into continuous waveforms to improve genomic feature extraction across several bioinformatics classification tasks, with only indirect relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nucleic acid sequence analysis constitutes a core research area in biomedical and health informatics, playing a critical role in infectious disease surveillance, epigenetic regulation, and genomic biomarker discovery. However, most existing sequence encoding methods rely on discrete representations, which are inadequate for capturing the intrinsic continuous structural properties of biological sequences. Inspired by waveform representations in modern physics, we propose UniWave, a novel encoding framework that converts discrete nucleotide sequences into biologically informative one-dimensional continuous waveforms through base mapping, windowed sinc interpolation, and wavelet-based downsampling. To enable more efficient spatiotemporal modeling, we design a learnable positional encoding module, WavePosition, which incorporates positional information to project the one-dimensional waveform into a two-dimensional continuous representation. In addition, we develop a lightweight dual-attention network, InceptionTime-ATT, to facilitate efficient multi-scale extraction of biological features. Experiments conducted on multiple representative genomic benchmark tasks demonstrate that UniWave consistently and significantly outperforms conventional encoding methods in viral genotype classification, cross-species enhancer identification, epigenetic modification site detection, and bacterial genome classification. Moreover, UniWave maintains excellent robustness under perturbation and noise stress tests, while its low-dimensional continuous representation further contributes to reduced model complexity. In summary, UniWave establishes a novel paradigm for biomedical nucleic acid sequence encoding that is interpretable, noise-resilient, and computationally efficient, offering new avenues for uncovering disease-associated genomic patterns and advancing data-driven biomedical research.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a wash-free, light-activated (photocaged) DNA-oligo labeling strategy enabling multi-target super-resolution microscopy without repeated solution exchanges, improving nanometer-scale imaging stability in cells.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Super-resolution microscopy with DNA-fluorophore labels is primed for multi-target imaging of cell biological samples. However, direct interaction with the sample is required to exchange or add DNA-fluorophore labels in each imaging round, which can impair the accuracy of the imaging data at the nanometer scale. To bypass this requirement, we introduce a wash-free method that employs DNA oligonucleotides equipped with photocaging groups. Irradiation with light removes these photo-modulatable groups and changes the hybridization properties of DNA labels, enabling light-modulated targeting. We demonstrate this concept by imaging various cellular targets with confocal microscopy, single-molecule localization microscopy, and stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Single-cell and spatial transcriptomics have generated vast atlases of cellular states, yet these data are almost exclusively used for analysis rather than generation. Here we introduce the LLM-based model PGL, Portraying Gene Language, a framework that reframes single-cell transcriptomes as a language generation modeling problem. PGL represents each cell as a long sequence of gene expression tokens and uses a large language model to synthesize complete single-cell RNA-seq profiles from metadata alone, such as tissue and disease context. PGL-generated cells recapitulate dataset-specific transcriptomic structure, align with known cancer subtype biology, and mix coherently with real single-cell datasets. Notably, generated cells can be used as effective references for spatial transcriptomics, enabling accurate cell-type mapping without matched single-cell atlases. By shifting single-cell modeling from representation learning to cell generation, PGL enables virtual cohort construction, hypothesis generation, and reference-on-demand analysis, positioning generative language models as foundational tools for in silico single-cell biology.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are pivotal in cellular processes ranging from RNA metabolism to 3D genome organization. A distinct subset, chromatin-associated RBPs (caRBPs), binds directly to chromatin to function as transcriptional regulators. However, identifying caRBPs via traditional methods like Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing (ChIP-seq) and Mass Spectrometry (MS) is labor-intensive and costly. While computational tools for DNA- and RNA-binding protein (DRBP) prediction exist, they often rely on outdated Gene Ontology annotations and fail to capture the unique characteristics of chromatin association. Here, we introduce caRBP-Pred, a novel deep learning approach combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (BiLSTM). Unlike previous methods utilizing full-length sequences, our model is trained on chromatin-contact peptides derived from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). caRBP-Pred achieves a superior Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.81 using peptide sequence information alone, significantly outperforming existing DRBP predictors which exhibit low recall for caRBPs. We further predicted 52 potential caRBPs in mice. Notably, validation against human homologs confirmed that our model accurately predicts candidates with experimentally verified chromatin-binding capabilities. Collectively, caRBP-Pred is the first tool specifically designed to predict caRBPs based on chromatin-contact peptides, offering a valuable resource for investigating regulatory roles of caRBPs on transcription.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Aging is a core biological process observed in most species and tissues, which is studied with a vast array of technologies. We argue that the abilities of AI systems to emulate aging and to accurately interpret biodata in its context are the key criteria to judge an LLM&#x27;s utility in biomedical research. Here, we present LongevityBench -- a collection of tasks designed to assess whether LLMs grasp the fundamental principles of aging biology and can use low-level biodata to arrive at phenotype-level conclusions. The benchmark covers a variety of prediction targets including human time-to-death, mutations&#x27; effect on lifespan, and age-dependent expression patterns. It spans all common biodata types used in longevity research: transcriptomes, DNA methylation profiles, proteomes, genomes, clinical blood tests and biometrics, as well as natural language annotations. After ranking state-of-the-art LLMs using LongevityBench, we highlight their weaknesses and outline procedures to maximize their utility in aging research.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> by Björn Vessman, Pablo Guridi-Fernández, Flor Inés Arias-Sánchez, Sara Mitri There is increasing interest in artificially selecting or breeding microbial communities, but experiments have reported modest success. Here, we develop computational models to simulate two previously known selection methods and compare them to a new “disassembly” method. We evaluate all three methods in their ability to find a community that could efficiently degrade toxins, whereby investment into degradation results in slower growth. Our disassembly method relies on repeatedly competing different communities of known species combinations against one another, while regularly shuffling around their species combinations. This approach allows many species combinations to be explored, thereby maintaining enough between-community diversity for selection to act on, and resulting in communities with high performance. Nevertheless, selection at the community level in our simulations did not counteract selection at the individual level, nor the communities’ ecological dynamics. Species in our model evolved to invest less into community function and more into growth, but increased growth compensated for reduced investment, such that overall community performance was barely affected by within-species evolution. Within-community ecological dynamics were more of a challenge, as we could control them during the selection process, but community composition and function dropped in the longer term. Our work shows that the strength of disassembly lies mainly in its ability to explore different species combinations, and helps to propose alternative designs for community selection experiments.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> CRANBERRY is a coarse-grained RNA dynamics model that adds sugar puckering and noncanonical base pairing to better reproduce RNA folding thermodynamics and disordered ensembles, offering potentially useful tools for RNA-world/Origins-of-Life studies though it is not explicitly prebiotic-focused.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We introduce a new coarse-grained model &#x27;&#x27;CRANBERRY&#x27;&#x27; that incorporates sugar puckering and non-canonical base pairing, two factors central to RNA structure and dynamics, yet rarely included in most coarse-grained models. Our model is parameterized through a contrastive divergence approach, combined with fine-tuning strategies to improve accuracy in generating disordered states, a feature that is critical for the accurate description of thermodynamics. This two-stage training procedure greatly enhances cooperative folding behavior. Due to these advances, the model&#x27;s predictive performance is comparable to that of all-atom force fields for native-state structural fluctuations. Furthermore, CRANBERRY exhibits better agreement with experimental data on stacking free energies and disordered structures measured by Small Angle X-ray Scattering. In addition, CRANBERRY can reversibly fold tetraloops with a minimum RMSD of 1.4 Angstrom de novo, which continues to be challenging for all-atom models. It predicts melting temperatures in agreement with experimental values, and with a greater cooperativity than all-atom predictions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Evolutionarily speaking, the ultimate goal of a lifeform is to reproduce and stave off extinction. Many plants and animals have evolved unique tricks to do so. One of these tricks is mimicry, which might be used to trick other species into believing it is dangerous in order to avoid becoming a meal, or to increase the likelihood of reproduction.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Quantifies cross-species scaling of mammalian cardiomyocyte transverse-axial tubular system architecture versus body size, lifespan, and heart rate, with minimal relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cardiac excitation-contraction coupling relies on a pancellular network of regular cardiomyocyte surface membrane invaginations, termed the transverse-axial tubular system (TATS). The TATS is ubiquitously present in adult mammalian cardiomyocytes, enabling efficient structural and functional coupling of sarcolemma and intracellular Ca2+ stores. However, TATS ultrastructural characteristics across species, and their relation to cardiomyocyte morphology and physiological parameters such as heart rate, remain largely unexplored. Here, we quantified TATS and cardiomyocyte features in a large confocal microscopy dataset (78 3D volumes) obtained from tissue slices across eight species (mouse, rat, rabbit, pig, horse, elephant, whale, and human). We developed and applied a semi-automated image analysis pipeline to quantify mean cytosolic distances to the nearest TATS (Cyto-TATSmin, a measure inversely related to TATS density), transverse-to-axial tubule ratio, and cardiomyocyte dimensions. Cyto-TATSmin and transverse tubule fraction differed substantially between species, with the lowest Cyto-TATSmin in mouse and highest in human. Within species, except mouse, rat, and horse, Cyto-TATSmin was positively correlated with cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area. Across all species, Cyto-TATSmin correlated with species life span and body weight, and was inversely correlated with average resting heart rate. Our findings reveal structural scaling principles within species differences in cardiac cellular ultrastructure and provide a resource for studying TATS organisation in health and disease. As TATS remodelling is a common hallmark of cardiac pathology, awareness of species-differences is needed to guide the design and interpretation of translational research.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Develops native charge-detection mass spectrometry to directly measure intact kilobase-scale mRNA masses, charge states, and impurity populations—an advanced RNA analytical tool with indirect relevance to origins-of-life nucleic acid studies.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) enables direct measurement of mass and charge for individual ions and overcomes fundamental limitations of conventional electrospray mass spectrometry for large, heterogeneous biomolecules. Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) represent a particularly challenging analytical target, as transcripts often span thousands of nucleotides, exhibit substantial heterogeneity, and form higher-order oligomers that are difficult to assess using existing workflows. Here, we optimize and evaluate native CDMS for intact analysis of long mRNAs and conduct systematic comparison of positive and negative analysis polarities. Using a panel of commercially available mRNAs ranging from approximately 1,000 to 4,500 nucleotides, we demonstrate that native CDMS enables direct, and accurate mass measurement of intact mRNAs alongside various process-related impurities (truncations, dimers etc.). Collisional activation improves mass accuracy by reducing adduct heterogeneity while preserving the ability to resolve impurity populations. Across all constructs, CDMS provides quantitative access to charge distributions that scale with transcript length and respond predictably to activation, denaturation, and polarity, offering insight into ion charging behavior and charge accommodation for large RNAs. Negative polarity measurements generally access higher charge states than positive polarity, particularly for the largest transcripts, improving sensitivity and relative size discrimination, while intact mass accuracy remains comparable between polarities when appropriate ion transmission strategies are employed. Together, these results establish native CDMS as a versatile and information-rich platform for intact mRNA characterization, providing simultaneous access to mass, charge, and impurity information that complements existing analytical methods and supports emerging needs in RNA biotherapeutic development.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Demonstrates an organic TADF photosensitizer (4CzIPN) driving cobaloxime-catalyzed light-powered hydrogen evolution with high TONs and mechanistic insight into singlet-state quenching by ammonium ascorbate, offering indirect relevance to potential prebiotic photoredox energy transduction.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> TADF compounds have found great application as photocatalyst in recent years. Their use as photosensitizers (PS), however, is still limited although they have a huge potential as abundant alternatives for traditional noble metal-based PSs, such as [Ru(bpy)3]2+. We herein investigate the TADF compound 4CzIPN as a PS together with the catalyst cobaloxime (Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl) in the photochemical hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER). After optimization using a multi-batch screening photoreactor, we achieved turnover numbers (TONs) of over 5,000 with ammonium ascorbate as an abundant sacrificial electron donor (SED). Stern-Volmer quenching experiments and scalar-relativistic quantum-chemical calculations provided rate constants for the different processes in the photosensitization mechanism, demonstrating that the quenching of the excited singlet state (S1) of 4CzIPN by ammonium ascorbate is by far more dominant than the quenching of its excited triplet state (T1). This work demonstrates that 4CzIPN is capable of sensitizing the cobaloxime-catalyzed light-driven HER with ammonium ascorbate as the SED and gives an excited insight into the quenching mechanism of TADF compounds as PSs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> TADF compounds have found great application as photocatalyst in recent years. Their use as photosensitizers (PS), however, is still limited although they have a huge potential as abundant alternatives for traditional noble metal-based PSs, such as [Ru(bpy)3]2+. We herein investigate the TADF compound 4CzIPN as a PS together with the catalyst cobaloxime (Co(dmgH)2(py)Cl) in the photochemical hydrogen-evolution reaction (HER). After optimization using a multi-batch screening photoreactor, we achieved turnover numbers (TONs) of over 5,000 with ammonium ascorbate as an abundant sacrificial electron donor (SED). Stern-Volmer quenching experiments and scalar-relativistic quantum-chemical calculations provided rate constants for the different processes in the photosensitization mechanism, demonstrating that the quenching of the excited singlet state (S1) of 4CzIPN by ammonium ascorbate is by far more dominant than the quenching of its excited triplet state (T1). This work demonstrates that 4CzIPN is capable of sensitizing the cobaloxime-catalyzed light-driven HER with ammonium ascorbate as the SED and gives an excited insight into the quenching mechanism of TADF compounds as PSs.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Develops an antimicrobial peptide–based PET imaging and targeted radionuclide therapy pair for specifically detecting and treating (methicillin-resistant) S. aureus infections, with limited relevance to origins-of-life research beyond general DNA-targeting biology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a major bacterial pathogen and a significant biothreat, representing a leading cause of bacterial mortality worldwide. The challenge is compounded by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), a strain resistant to first-line antibiotics, which is associated with a 64% higher mortality rate compared to susceptible strains. Current methods for accurately identifying and localizing occult infections are limited, and there is a critical lack of effective novel treatments for infections that fail to respond to antibiotics. To address this, we pioneered the development of an antimicrobial peptide (AMP)-based radiotheranostic pair for the imaging-guided treatment of S. aureus and MRSA infections. We first screened a library of renowned AMPs for their efficacy against (MR)SA and their suitability for non-invasive, whole-body PET imaging after radiolabeling with Gallium-68. The optimal candidate, [68Ga]QAMP3, demonstrated excellent performance, readily and specifically accumulating in both S. aureus and MRSA infection sites, but not in sterile inflammation or tumors. A pilot first-in-human study confirmed the translatable diagnostic potential and favorable biosafety profile of [68Ga]QAMP3. Furthermore, the corresponding therapeutic agent, [177Lu]QAMP3, effectively reduced bacterial load in rat models of septic arthritis caused by both S. aureus and MRSA following a single systemic administration. Treatment resulted in the complete restoration of joint morphology, comparable to healthy controls. Simultaneously, [68Ga]QAMP3 PET/CT imaging accurately monitored the therapeutic response to both [177Lu]QAMP3 and conventional antibiotic treatment. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the stable α-helical conformation of QAMP3 likely confers superior membrane permeability and subsequent internalization into bacterial cells, leading to lethal DNA damage. These findings position [68Ga]/[177Lu]QAMP3 as an innovative theranostic pair for the rapid diagnosis and effective treatment of MRSA infections. This study also paves the way for developing new radio-antibiotics with mechanisms of action that can circumvent conventional antibiotic resistance.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> RNA-seq comparison of rapamycin-treated D. melanogaster vs D. simulans shows sex- and tissue-dependent evolutionary divergence in mTOR-mediated transcriptional regulation despite overall conserved tissue expression.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Evolutionary divergence in gene regulation is a major source of phenotypic novelty, yet understanding how deeply conserved, pleiotropic signaling pathways evolve under selective constraint while maintaining essential cellular functions remains an important challenge. Here, we investigate the evolutionary divergence in transcriptional regulation mediated by the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway in two related species, Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans. mTOR is a highly conserved central regulator of cellular growth and metabolism, making it well-suited for the study of regulatory evolution under functional constraint. Using a fully factorial RNA-seq design, we quantified transcriptional responses to mTOR inhibition by rapamycin across three tissues (head, thorax, and abdomen) and both sexes. Despite highly conserved tissue-specific expression - reflecting the close phylogenetic relationship between species - mTOR-mediated transcriptional responses showed clear evidence of evolutionary divergence. Divergence varied across tissues and sexes: heads of both sexes and female thoraces and abdomens showed the most rapid gene-level divergence, suggesting stronger directional selection, whereas male thorax and abdomen exhibited comparatively conserved responses, consistent with stabilizing selection. Gene-level divergence patterns were consistent across multiple metrics and generally mirrored pathway-level divergence, except in the female abdomen, which showed relative pathway-level conservation despite extensive gene-level divergence. Species-by-treatment interaction analyses further revealed divergence in core mTOR-regulated biological processes. Together, our results suggest that regulatory modularity may allow even highly conserved signaling pathways to evolve under context-specific selective pressures while maintaining critical functionality.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Opportunistic bacterial pathogens often encounter strong selective pressures outside their hosts, yet the evolutionary consequences of long-term predator exposure remain poorly understood. Here, we used experimental evolution to examine how sustained interaction with a eukaryotic predator shapes genomic adaptation, phenotypic diversification, and virulence-associated traits in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Replicate populations of P. aeruginosa were evolved for 60 days in the presence or absence of the ciliate predator Tetrahymena thermophila, followed by whole-population metagenomic sequencing, isolate-level genome sequencing, and quantitative phenotypic assays. We observed extensive genetic diversification across all populations, with strong signatures of both positive and purifying selection and pervasive parallel evolution at gene and nucleotide levels. Predator-exposed populations accumulated mutations enriched in regulatory, metabolic, and virulence-associated pathways, revealing predictable genomic targets of selection. However, many parallel mutations were shared between predator-exposed and predator-free populations, indicating that adaptation to the abiotic environment represented a dominant selective force. Genotype-phenotype analyses revealed pleiotropic effects and trade-offs linking motility, growth, and virulence-associated traits. Despite pronounced genomic adaptation and coordinated phenotypic shifts, changes in virulence in an in vivo host model were modest and context dependent. Taken together, our results indicate that predator exposure can influence evolutionary trajectories in P. aeruginosa and highlight the value of extending such approaches across multiple ecological and host contexts.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Proposes a high-precision mechanical stop-and-go nanopore (or optically read) DNA sequencing scheme that could be relevant as an enabling technology for future astrobiology/life-detection assays but is not directly focused on origins-of-life chemistry or abiogenesis.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> DNA sequencing using nanopores and a mechanical positioning system with 0.1-0.15 nm movement precision and ~1 μs movement times is proposed. A single strand of DNA (ssDNA) is attached to a homonucleotide header immobilized on a glass slide mounted on a platform in the cis chamber of an electrolytic cell (e-cell) with a nanopore. The header-strand is moved into the trans chamber and retracted mechanically one nucleotide at a time. Two approaches to sequencing are described. In the first the blockade current due to the segment of the header-strand in the pore is measured with a low bandwidth (&lt; 1 KHZ); a Markov-like method identifies the next base from earlier blockade current levels. In principle, with a bandwidth of 1 KHz and an array of ~600 pores with a CMOS detector array a human genome (3 × 109 bases) can be sequenced in &lt; 1.5 hours, or ~5 hours start-to-finish (sample preparation, ligation with header, threading, data acquisition, and post-processing, plus machine-learning-based methods for base calling). This theoretical sequencing speed is comparable to the practical speed of the recently reported Sequencing By Expansion (SBX) method; it remains to be seen if this level of performance can be delivered in practice. The second approach is based on replacing the enzyme motor in the Sequencing-by-Synthesis (SBS) method with a mechanical positioning system and using a header-strand with a hybridized primer. Synthesis consists of elongating the latter with a protected dNTP carrying a fluorescently tagged base that complements the next open base in the strand followed by deprotection of the dNTP and cleaving of the tag, the latter is detected optically with a Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) camera in trans. This electromechanical-optical alternative to SBS provides better control over sequencing by shielding earlier added nucleotides and reducing cross-talk in the neighborhood of the terminal nucleotide being extended. In theory, with a 1000 × 1000 array of DNA header-strands each ~200 bases long and a cycle time of ~90 seconds, a human chromosome can be sequenced in ~5 hours. The possibility of using the method for data retrieval from DNA-based storage is discussed.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Study dissects carbonate- and calcium-mediated adsorption competition on silicate mineral surfaces during flotation, offering only tangential relevance to origins-of-life via general mineral–water interfacial chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spodumene separation from gangue minerals such as quartz is challenging, as both silicate minerals are activated by metal cations, naturally present in process water, like Ca2+. Research has shown that when used as a pH modifier, Na2CO3 can depress both minerals, to different degrees, in the presence of Ca2+, but the mechanisms remain unclear. We use spectroscopic and computational methods to examine the interaction of Na2CO3 with Ca-activated quartz and spodumene surfaces in the presence of sodium oleate (NaOL) and the consequences for their selective flotation. Our results indicate that adsorption competition between the collector (Ca/OL complexes) and depressant (CaCO3) species occurs on spodumene and quartz surfaces. We provide detailed mechanisms of the interactions, including with respect to the adsorbed species, their relative amounts, surface charge, and the adsorption strengths. Although both the collector and depressant were adsorbed onto both minerals, the collector had more affinity for spodumene than quartz (-296.14 kJ/mol vs -192.99 kJ/mol), unlike the depressant (-288.55 kJ/mol vs -311.59 kJ/mol), hence the soda ash induced surface deprotonation and desorption of Ca/OL complexes from quartz during conditioning, but not from spodumene. Unlike quartz, which had only Ca as the surface site for reagent adsorption, spodumene also had surface Al sites. The results explain the limited depression of spodumene and the total depression of quartz in flotation using fatty acid-based collectors. Specifically, in the presence of Ca2+, Na2CO3 treatment increased the Li2O grades from 2.53 to 4.40 %, while maintaining a high lithium recovery of 71 %. Overall, the study demonstrated that, in addition to being a pH modifier, Na2CO3 acts as a selective quartz depressant in the Ca-activated flotation of spodumene-quartz, making it a more effective pH modifier than NaOH directly prior to spodumene flotation. Since quartz is a common gangue mineral in most flotation systems, these findings can be applied to benefit other flotation systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Over the recent years lanthanide-binding proteins such as lanmodulin, a naturally lanthanide-binding EF-hand protein from Methylorubrum extorquens AM1, as well as protein-inspired lanthanide-binding peptides have become of increasing interest for the development of separation and recycling methods for rare earth elements. For the first time, a set of head-to-tail cyclised lanmodulin-inspired peptides and their complexation behaviour towards lanthanides was comprehensively examined in aqueous media using time-resolved laser induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies, complemented by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and advanced mass spectrometry methods. Results obtained from this multi-method approach evidence that the head-to-tail cyclisation can indeed increase the lanthanide-affinity in natural sequences and positively impact the pre-organisation of the metal-free peptide while limiting the amount of formed complex species in comparison to linear analogues. Furthermore, the impact of minimal sequence alterations by inserting glycine is shown to be useful in NMR experiments for probing alterations in the local environment of neighbouring amino acids potentially involved in coordination. Lastly, KD values for the peptides with the whole Ln series (except Pm) and the actinide curium are presented.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> A survey of NLP sentiment analysis techniques for movie reviews (lexicon/ML to transformers and multimodal cues), with no connection to origins of life or astrobiology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07235v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of sentiment analysis methods for movie reviews, a benchmark task that has played a central role in advancing natural language processing. We review the evolution of techniques from early lexicon-based and classical machine learning approaches to modern deep learning architectures and large language models, covering widely used datasets such as IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and SST-2, and models ranging from Naive Bayes and support vector machines to LSTM networks, BERT, and attention-based transformers. Beyond summarizing prior work, this survey differentiates itself by offering a comparative, challenge-driven analysis of how these modeling paradigms address domain-specific issues such as sarcasm, negation, contextual ambiguity, and domain shift, which remain open problems in existing literature. Unlike earlier reviews that focus primarily on text-only pipelines, we also synthesize recent advances in multimodal sentiment analysis that integrate textual, audio, and visual cues from movie trailers and clips. In addition, we examine emerging concerns related to interpretability, fairness, and robustness that are often underexplored in prior surveys, and we outline future research directions including zero-shot and few-shot learning, hybrid symbolic--neural models, and real-time deployment considerations. Overall, this abstract provides a domain-focused roadmap that highlights both established solutions and unresolved challenges toward building more accurate, generalizable, and explainable sentiment analysis systems for movie review data.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06059v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The evolution of semantic communications has profoundly impacted wireless video transmission, whose applications dominate driver of modern bandwidth consumption. However, most existing schemes are predominantly optimized for simple additive white Gaussian noise or Rayleigh fading channels, neglecting the ubiquitous multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) environments that critically hinder practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we propose the context video semantic transmission (CVST) framework under MIMO channels. Building upon an efficient contextual video transmission backbone, CVST effectively learns a context-channel correlation map to explicitly formulate the relationships between feature groups and MIMO subchannels. Leveraging these channel-aware features, we design a multi-reference entropy coding mechanism, enabling channel state-aware variable length coding. Furthermore, CVST incorporates a checkerboard-based feature modulation strategy to achieve multiple rate points within a single trained model, thereby enhancing deployment flexibility. These innovations constitute our multi-reference variable length and rate coding (MR-VLRC) scheme. By integrating contextual transmission with MR-VLRC, CVST demonstrates substantial performance gains over various standardized separated coding methods and recent wireless video semantic communication approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/xie233333/CVST.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This paper focuses on beamforming and optimization for covert MIMO GEO satellite uplink communications, with no apparent connection to origins-of-life, astrobiology, habitability, or biosignature science.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06110v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This paper investigates the uplink covert communication in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) satellite-terrestrial system consisting of an Earth station transmitter Alice, a geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) satellite receiver Bob, and multiple GEO satellite wardens around Bob, where each node in the system is equipped with an array of directional antennas. Based on beamforming and the default antenna orientation setting, we first propose a scheme for covert Alice-Bob uplink transmission. Under the perfect channel estimation scenario, we provide theoretical modeling for the system performance in terms of detection error probability (DEP), transmission outage probability (TOP) and covert rate (CR), and then explore the optimal beamforming (OB) design as well as the joint optimal beamforming and antenna orientation (JO-BA) design for CR maximization. We then extend our study to the imperfect channel estimation scenario, and conduct related performance modeling and OB/JO-BA designs for CR maximization. We also apply the techniques of semidefinite relaxation, alternating optimization, Rodrigues&#x27; rotation formula and 1-D search algorithm to develop efficient algorithms to solve the above optimization problems. Finally, extensive numerical results are presented to verify our theoretical results and to illustrate the efficiency of beamforming and antenna orientation design for supporting the uplink covert communication in MIMO GEO satellite-terrestrial systems.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Deep reinforcement learning (DQN) is used to optimize frequency-hopping communication under predictive Markov jamming with noise/fading and error-correcting codes, but it has no meaningful connection to origins-of-life or astrobiology topics.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06095v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning based solution for jamming communications using Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum technology in a 16 channel radio environment is presented. Deep Q Network based transmitter continuously selects the next frequency hopping channel while facing first order reactive jamming, which uses observed transition statistics to predict and interrupt transmissions. Through self training, the proposed agent learns a uniform random frequency hopping policy that effectively neutralizes the predictive advantage of the jamming. In the presence of Rayleigh fading and additive noise, the impact of forward error correction Bose Chaudhuri Hocquenghem type codes is systematically evaluated, demonstrating that even moderate redundancy significantly reduces packet loss. Extensive visualization of the learning dynamics, channel utilization distribution, epsilon greedy decay, cumulative reward, BER and SNR evolution, and detailed packet loss tables confirms convergence to a near optimal jamming strategy. The results provide a practical framework for autonomous resilient communications in modern electronic warfare scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06075v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Jamming attacks pose a critical threat to wireless networks, particularly in cell-free massive MIMO systems, where distributed access points and user equipment (UE) create complex, time-varying topologies. This paper proposes a novel jamming detection framework leveraging dynamic graphs and graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) to address this challenge. By modeling the network as a dynamic graph, we capture evolving communication links and detect jamming attacks as anomalies in the graph evolution. A GCN-Transformer-based model, trained with supervised learning, learns graph embeddings to identify malicious interference. Performance evaluation in simulated scenarios with moving UEs, varying jamming conditions and channel fadings, demonstrates the method&#x27;s effectiveness, which is assessed through accuracy and F1 score metrics, achieving promising results for effective jamming detection.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Analytical modeling of coverage and spectral efficiency in NOMA-enabled LEO satellite downlink networks, with ordering and power-allocation schemes, but no connection to origins-of-life or astrobiology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2501.05946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: This paper investigates an analytical model for low-earth orbit (LEO) multi-satellite downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. The satellites transmit data to multiple NOMA user terminals (UTs), each employing successive interference cancellation (SIC) for decoding. Two ordering schemes are adopted for NOMA-enabled LEO satellite networks, i.e., mean signal power (MSP)-based ordering and instantaneous signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (ISINR)-based ordering. For each ordering scheme, we derive the analytical expression for the coverage probability of each typical UT. Moreover, we discuss how coverage is influenced by SIC, main-lobe gain, and tradeoffs between the number of satellites and their altitudes. Additionally, two user fairness-based power allocation (PA) schemes are considered, and PA coefficients with the optimal number of UTs that maximize their sum spectral efficiency (SE) are studied. Simulation results show that there exists a maximum effective signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold for each PA scheme that ensures the operation of NOMA in LEO satellite networks, and NOMA provides performance gains only when the target SINR is below a certain threshold. Compared with orthogonal multiple access (OMA), NOMA increases UTs&#x27; sum SE by as much as 35%. Furthermore, for most SINR thresholds, the sum SE increases with the number of UTs to the highest value, whilst the maximum sum SE is obtained when there are two UTs.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Develops algorithms and coding-theoretic bounds to reduce sequencing reads for random access retrieval in engineered DNA data storage, with limited direct relevance to origins-of-life research beyond the use of DNA as an information substrate.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07053v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: As DNA data storage moves closer to practical deployment, minimizing sequencing coverage depth is essential to reduce both operational costs and retrieval latency. This paper addresses the recently studied Random Access Problem, which evaluates the expected number of read samples required to recover a specific information strand from $n$ encoded strands. We propose a novel algorithm to compute the exact expected number of reads, achieving a computational complexity of $O(n)$ for fixed field size $q$ and information length $k$. Furthermore, we derive explicit formulas for the average and maximum expected number of reads, enabling an efficient search for optimal generator matrices under small parameters. Beyond theoretical analysis, we present new code constructions that improve the best-known upper bound from $0.8815k$ to $0.8811k$ for $k=3$, and achieve an upper bound of $0.8629k$ for $k=4$ for sufficiently large $q$. We also establish a tighter theoretical lower bound on the expected number of reads that improves upon state-of-the-art bounds. In particular, this bound establishes the optimality of the simple parity code for the case of $n=k+1$ across any alphabet $q$.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present a comprehensive investigation of the low-temperature topochemical modification of the Ruddlesden–Popper-type indium oxyfluoride LaBaInO3F2 using sodium hydride (NaH). By varying NaH equivalents, we monitored phase evolution, anion exchange, and reduction pathways using combined structural, spectroscopic, elemental and the density functional theory (DFT) analysis. LaBaInO3F2 undergoes controlled anion-extraction, with hydride-for-fluoride substitution produces mixed-anion oxy-fluoride-hydride phases, LaBaInO3F2−xHy, and NaF as a stable by-product. At moderate xNaH contents (x≤1), the RP-framework incorporates hydride with minimal decomposition, supported by re-oxidation experiments and DFT-calculated reaction enthalpies that confirm oxidizable hydride and subtle modification of the indium coordination environment. For xNaH&gt;1 result in the formation of secondary phases, indicating progressive lattice degradation. XPS indicates the possibility of subtle reduction of indium, with redox changes secondary to anion exchange. The executed study revealed a pathway how to stabilize hydride ions next to In3+, which is known to be notoriously hard otherwise. Optical spectroscopy reveals bandgap narrowing and enhanced visible-light absorption in hydride-rich samples, however, DFT estimates that idealized hydride substitution widens the bandgap, consistent with the experimentally non-ideal reduction with secondary phases. Overall, these findings establish hydride-based topochemical strategies as a promising route for controlled anion exchange with implications for photocatalytic and energy applications.</p>

This reduction enables boundedness and stability assessment of vector DDEs through the dynamics of their scalar counterparts, using straightforward simulations or simplified analytical reasoning. New boundedness and stability criteria and the estimates of the radii of balls containing history functions that yield bounded or stable solutions for the original vector systems were derived and validated through representative simulations.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Active colloids that convert light into motion provide insight into non-equilibrium chemical systems and routes toward microscale engines. Here we quantify the propulsion dynamics and force generation of light-activated Au-TiO2 Janus particles and their optically trappable polystyrene (PS) core-shell Au-PS@TiO2 analogues. By varying particle size, metal thickness, fuel concentration, and illumination wavelength, we show how photochemical energy conversion at the Au-TiO2 interface governs propulsion, yielding instantaneous velocities up to ~100 μm s⁻¹. Optical tweezers measurements on single Au-PS@TiO2 Janus particles reveal transient propulsion forces up to 20 pN lasting hundreds of milliseconds. Simulations incorporating these transient forces reproduce the observed trajectories, confirming their role in driving active motion. Functionalization with long DNA polymers further enhances propulsion by reducing rotational diffusion. These results establish a single-particle framework for quantifying active forces in photocatalytic Janus particles and offer design principles for light-powered micromotors.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06330v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Stability and boundedness analysis for vector nonlinear systems with variable delays and coefficients remains challenging due to the conservatism of existing methods. Moreover, estimates of the transient behavior of solution norms remain insufficiently developed. This paper presents an approach to estimate the temporal evolution of solution norms and applies it to the analysis of boundedness and stability of vector nonlinear systems with variable delays and coefficients. The method is based on a novel scheme for successive approximations of the original solutions, complemented by the estimates of the corresponding residual norms. This leads to the construction of a scalar nonlinear delay equation whose solutions provide upper bounds for the evolution of residual norms. As a result, bilateral bounds on the original solution norms are obtained, yielding effective boundedness and stability criteria and enabling estimation of the associated regions. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approximations rapidly approach the reference boundaries of the regions of interest as the iteration count increases. Moreover, the bilateral bounds progressively approach each other and the norm of the reference solution when the initial function remains within the considered regions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Proposes a new evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm and benchmark suite for few-for-many optimization, with no direct connection to origins-of-life or astrobiology beyond the generic use of &quot;evolutionary&quot; methods.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06387v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Few-for-many (F4M) optimization, recently introduced as a novel paradigm in multi-objective optimization, aims to find a small set of solutions that effectively handle a large number of conflicting objectives. Unlike traditional many-objective optimization methods, which typically attempt comprehensive coverage of the Pareto front, F4M optimization emphasizes finding a small representative solution set to efficiently address high-dimensional objective spaces. Motivated by the computational complexity and practical relevance of F4M optimization, this paper proposes a new evolutionary algorithm explicitly tailored for efficiently solving F4M optimization problems. Inspired by SMS-EMOA, our proposed approach employs a $(\mu+1)$-evolution strategy guided by the objective of F4M optimization. Furthermore, to facilitate rigorous performance assessment, we propose a novel benchmark test suite specifically designed for F4M optimization by leveraging the similarity between the R2 indicator and F4M formulations. Our test suite is highly flexible, allowing any existing multi-objective optimization problem to be transformed into a corresponding F4M instance via scalarization using the weighted Tchebycheff function. Comprehensive experimental evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms, especially on instances involving a large number of objectives. The source code of the proposed algorithm will be released publicly. Source code is available at https://github.com/MOL-SZU/SoM-EMOA.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a feedback-guided, memory-augmented “controlled self-evolution” framework for optimizing algorithmic code with LLMs, but it has no direct origins-of-life or astrobiology relevance beyond metaphorical use of evolution.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07348v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Self-evolution methods enhance code generation through iterative &quot;generate-verify-refine&quot; cycles, yet existing approaches suffer from low exploration efficiency, failing to discover solutions with superior complexity within limited budgets. This inefficiency stems from initialization bias trapping evolution in poor solution regions, uncontrolled stochastic operations lacking feedback guidance, and insufficient experience utilization across tasks.To address these bottlenecks, we propose Controlled Self-Evolution (CSE), which consists of three key components. Diversified Planning Initialization generates structurally distinct algorithmic strategies for broad solution space coverage. Genetic Evolution replaces stochastic operations with feedback-guided mechanisms, enabling targeted mutation and compositional crossover. Hierarchical Evolution Memory captures both successful and failed experiences at inter-task and intra-task levels.Experiments on EffiBench-X demonstrate that CSE consistently outperforms all baselines across various LLM backbones. Furthermore, CSE achieves higher efficiency from early generations and maintains continuous improvement throughout evolution.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2509.14923v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) are a class of non-equilibrium phase transitions that occur in many-body quantum systems during real-time evolution, rather than through parameter tuning as in conventional phase transitions. This paper presents an exact analytical approach to studying DQPTs by combining complex dynamics with the real-space renormalization group (RG). RG transformations are interpreted as iterated maps on the complex plane, establishing a connection between DQPTs and the Julia set, the boundary separating the basins of attraction of the stable fixed points. This framework is applied to a quantum quench in the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, where we examine the sensitivity of DQPTs to variations in boundary conditions. We show that altering the topology of the spin chain can suppress DQPTs and provide a qualitative explanation based on quantum speed limits.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07080v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Lava worlds are rocky planets with dayside skins made molten by stellar irradiation. Tidal heating on these shortest-period planets is more than skin deep. We show how orbital eccentricities of just a few percent (within current observed bounds and maintained secularly by exterior companions) can create deep magma oceans. ``Lava tidal waves&#x27;&#x27; slosh across these oceans; we compute the multi-modal response of the ocean to tidal forcing, subject to a coastline at the day-night terminator and a parameterized viscous drag. Wave interference produces a dayside heat map that is spatially irregular and highly time-variable; hotspots can wander both east and west of the substellar point, and thermal light curves can vary and spike aperiodically, from orbit to orbit and within an orbit. Heat deposited by tides is removed in steady state by a combination of fluid, mushy, and solid-state convection in the mantle. For Earth-sized planets with sub-day periods, the entire mantle may be tidally liquified.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Uses an energy-balance climate model with a carbonate–silicate cycle to argue early Mars plausibly underwent episodic warm–cold limit cycles that could intermittently permit liquid water and explain timing of valley networks and deltas.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07159v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Evidence for fluvial features and standing liquid water indicate that Mars was a warmer and wetter place in its past; however, climate models have historically been unable to produce conditions to yield a warm early Mars under the faint young sun. Some models invoke thick greenhouse atmospheres to produce continuously warm conditions, but others have argued that available geologic evidence is more consistent with short-duration and transient warming events on an otherwise cold Mars. One possibility of harmonizing these perspectives is that early Mars experienced climate limit cycles that caused the climate to oscillate between short periods of warmth and prolonged periods of glaciation, due to modulation of greenhouse warming by the carbonate-silicate cycle. This study suggests that episodic limit cycling during the Noachian and Hesperian periods provides a hypothetical explanation for the timing and formation of fluvial features on Mars. A schematic time-forward trajectory of the full history of Mars is calculated using an energy balance climate model, which includes an active carbonate-silicate cycle, instellation changes due to the sun&#x27;s main sequence evolution, variations in the obliquity of Mars, and supplemental warming from additional greenhouse gases beyond carbon dioxide alone. These calculations demonstrate the viability of a climate history for Mars involving episodic limit cycling to enable the formation of the valley networks at 4.1-3.5 Ga and delta features at 3.3-3.0 Ga, interspersed with cold stable climates and ending in the late Amazonian in a carbon dioxide condensation regime. This schematic climate trajectory provide a plausible narrative that remains consistent with available geologic data, and further exploration of warming mechanisms for the climate of Mars should consider the possibility of episodic transient events driven by carbonate-silicate limit cycling.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06263v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Among the many recommendations of the Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020, we found that a priority area of research is to pave the pathways towards finding and characterizing habitable worlds. In this context, we aim to understand how planetary systems evolve through atmospheric escape, and develop techniques to identify potentially Earth-like worlds. Using the ultraviolet (UV) capabilities of the Habitable Worlds Observatory, we can use transit spectroscopy observations to determine what processes drive the evolution of exoplanets, how well can small exoplanets retain atmospheres, and search for Earth-like atmospheres. We advocate the development of a UV spectrograph that is capable of moderate- to high-resolution spectroscopy of point sources, access to key spectral features between 1000 and 3000 Angstrom, and UV detectors that are resilient to high count rates.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07471v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Recent models of the near-Earth asteroid population show that asteroids must be super-catastrophically destroyed when they evolve to orbits with perihelion passages well inside of Mercury&#x27;s orbit. The heliocentric distances at which the disruptions typically occur are tens of solar radii, which is too far from the Sun for asteroids to be destroyed by sublimation and tidal disruption. The typical disruption distance also appears to be larger for darker asteroids. Here, by carrying out irradiance experiments in vacuum that replicate the conditions in the near-Sun environment, we show that CI meteorite simulants are destroyed within minutes when exposed to the level of solar irradiance encountered at heliocentric distances of up to about 0.2 au. Our results provide an explanation for the scarcity of dark, carbonaceous asteroids with perihelion distances less than 0.2 au, and for the observed mass-loss rate of the asteroid-like object 322P/SOHO~1 assuming its composition is similar to CI carbonaceous chondrites.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06386v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Executive Summary: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is the first astrophysics flagship mission with a key cross-divisional astrobiology science goal of searching for signs of life on rocky planets beyond our solar system. The Living Worlds Working Group under the Science, Technology, and Architecture Review Team (START) was charged with investigating how HWO could characterize potentially habitable exoplanets orbiting stars in the solar neighborhood, search for signs of life, and interpret potential biosignatures within a false positive and false negative framework. In particular, we focused on (1) identifying biosignatures that have spectral features in the UV-Vis-NIR wavelength range and defining their measurement requirements, (2) determining additional information needed from the planet and planet system to interpret biosignatures and assess the likelihood of false positives, and (3) assembling current knowledge of likely HWO target stars and identify which properties of host stars and systems are most critical to know in advance of HWO. The Living Worlds atmospheric biosignatures science case is considered one of the key drivers in the design of the observatory. An additional 10 astrobiology science cases were developed that collectively revealed key research gaps and needs required to fully explore the observatory parameter space and perform science return analyses. Investment in these research gaps will require coordination across the Science Mission Directorate and fall under the purview of the new Division-spanning astrobiology strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07465v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: One of the primary mission goals of the Kepler space telescope was to detect Earth-like terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around Sun-like stars. These planets are at the detection limit, where the Kepler detection and vetting pipeline produced unreliable planet candidates. We present a novel pipeline that improves the removal of localized defects prior to the planet search, improves vetting at the level of individual transits and introduces a Bayes factor test statistic and an algorithm for extracting multiple candidates from a single detection run. We show with injections in the Kepler data that the introduced novelties improve pipeline&#x27;s completeness at a fixed false alarm rate. We apply the pipeline to the stars with previously identified planet candidates and show that our pipeline successfully recovers the previously confirmed candidates, but flags a considerable portion of unconfirmed candidates as likely false alarms, especially in the long period, low signal-to-noise ratio regime. In particular, several known Earth-like candidates in the habitable zone, such as KOI 8063.01, 8107.01 and 8242.01, are identified as false alarms, which could have a significant impact on the estimates of $\eta_{\oplus}$, i.e., the occurrence of Earth-like planets in the habitable zone.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07414v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We report the confirmation of three transiting exoplanets orbiting TOI-1243 (LSPM~J0902+7138), TOI-4529 (G~2--21), and TOI-5388 (Wolf~346) that were initially detected by TESS through ground-based photometry and radial velocity follow-up measurements with CARMENES. The planets present short orbital periods of $4.65$, $5.88$, and $2.59$ days, and they orbit early-M dwarfs (M2.0V, M1.5V, and M3.0V, respectively). We were able to precisely determine the radius of all three planets with a precision of $&lt; 7\, \%$, the mass of TOI-1243 b with a precision of $19\, \%$, and upper mass limits for TOI-4529 b and TOI-5388 b. The radius of TOI-1243 b is $2.33\pm0.12\, {R_{\oplus}}$, its mass is $7.7 \pm 1.5\,{M_{\oplus}}$, and the mean density is $0.61 \pm 0.15 \, {\rho_\oplus}$. The radius of TOI-4529 b is $1.77 ^{+0.09}_{-0.08} \, {R_{\oplus}}$, the $3 {\sigma}$ upper mass limit is $4.9 \, {M_{\oplus}}$, and the $3 {\sigma}$ upper density limit is $0.88\, {\rho_\oplus}$. The third planet, TOI-5388 b, is Earth-sized with a radius of $0.99 ^{+0.07}_{-0.06} \, {R_{\oplus}}$, a $3 {\sigma}$ upper mass limit of $2.2 \, {M_{\oplus}}$, and a $3 {\sigma}$ upper density limit of $2.2\, {\rho_\oplus}$. While TOI-5388 b is most probably rocky, given its Earth-like radius, TOI-1243 b and TOI-4529 b are located in a highly degenerate region in the mass-radius space. TOI-4529 b appears to lean toward a water-world composition. TOI-1243 b has enough mass to host a significant H-He envelope, although a water-world and pure rocky compositions are also consistent with the data. Our analysis indicates that future atmospheric observations using JWST can aid in determining their real composition. The sample of small planets around M dwarfs is widely used to understand planet formation and composition theories, and our study adds three planets to this sample.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07457v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Small aromatic molecules, including functionalized derivatives of benzene, are known to be present throughout the different stages of star and planet formation. In particular, oxygen-bearing monosubstituted aromatics, likely including phenol, have been identified in the coma of comet 67P. This suggests that, earlier in the star and planet formation evolution, icy grains may act as both reservoirs and sites of functionalization for these small aromatics. We investigate the ice-phase reactivity of singlet oxygen atoms (O($^1$D)) with benzene, using ozone as a precursor that is readily photodissociated by relatively low-energy. Our experiments show that O($^1$D) efficiently reacts with benzene, forming phenol, benzene oxide, and oxepine as the main products. Phenol formation is temperature-independent, consistent with a barrierless insertion mechanism. In contrast, the formation of benzene oxide/oxepine shows a slight temperature dependence, suggesting that additional reaction pathways involving either ground-state or excited-state oxygen atoms may contribute. In H$_2$O and \COO ice matrices we find that dilution does not suppress formation of phenol. We extrapolate an experimental upper limit for the benzene-to-phenol conversion fraction of 27-44$\%$ during the lifetime of an interstellar cloud, assuming O($^1$D) production rates based on CO$_2$ ice abundances and a cosmic-ray induced UV field. We compare these estimates with a new analysis of data from the comet 67P, where the C$_6$H$_6$O/C$_6$H$_6$ ratio is 20$\pm$6$\%$. This value lies within our estimated range, suggesting that O($^1$D)-mediated chemistry is a viable pathway for producing oxygenated aromatics in cold astrophysical ices, potentially enriching icy planetesimals with phenol and other biorelevant compounds.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06236v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The transit method, during which a planet&#x27;s presence is inferred by measuring the reduction in flux as it passes in front of its parent star, is a highly successful exoplanet detection and characterization technique. During transit, the small fraction of starlight that passes through a planet&#x27;s atmosphere emerges with the fingerprints of atmospheric gases, aerosols and structure. During eclipse, the relatively small contribution of light from the planet itself may be observed as the planet is occulted by the star. For planets in near-edge-on, short-period orbits, observing the system throughout an entire orbit allows the varying flux from the planet to be extracted as the illuminated `dayside&#x27; rotates in and out of view. With spectroscopic observations, we can characterize not only the overall composition of the atmosphere, but also glean insights into atmospheric structure and dynamics. With over 6,000 transiting planets now discovered, such observations are currently our only window into a consistent sample of planetary atmospheres large enough to attempt a population-level study, a critical next step for our understanding of atmospheric science. The vast exoplanet population provides a laboratory for atmospheric physics, including chemistry, dynamics, cloud processes and evolution; extending these results to a larger number of targets will allow us to explore the effects of equilibrium temperature, gravity, mass and parent star type on atmospheric properties, as well as map observable trends to formation scenarios. These findings are critical for addressing STFC&#x27;s Science Vision Challenge B: how do stars and planetary systems develop and how do they support the existence of life?. Here we outline how the UK must fit within this strategic context, suggest approaches and development for the future, and outline the unique capabilities and leadership of scientists across the UK.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Presents a new low-cost 3D non-ideal MHD framework (COALA+RAMSES) showing rapid, anisotropic micron-sized dust growth in protostellar envelopes, informing early solid evolution relevant to later planet formation but only indirectly to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07088v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Dust plays a fundamental role during protostellar collapse, disk and planet formation. Recent observations suggest that efficient dust growth may begin early, in the protostellar envelopes, potentially even before the formation of the disk. Three-dimensional models of protostellar evolution, addressing multi-size dust growth, gas and dust dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics, are required to characterize the dust evolution in the embedded stages of star formation. We aim to establish a new framework for dust evolution models, following in 3D the dust size distribution both in time and space, in MHD models describing the formation and evolution of star-disk systems, at low numerical cost. We present our work coupling the COALA dust evolution module into the code RAMSES, performing the first 3D MHD simulation of protostellar collapse including simultaneously polydisperse dust growth modeled by the Smoluchowski equation as well as dust dynamics in the terminal velocity approximation. Ice-coated micron-sized grains can rapidly grow in the envelope and survive by not entering the fragmentation regime. The evolution of the dust size distribution is highly anisotropic due to the turbulent nature of the collapse and the development of favorable locations such as outflow cavity walls, which enhance locally the dust-to-gas ratio. We analyzed the first 3D non-ideal MHD simulations that self-consistently account for the dust dynamics and growth during the protostellar stage. Very early in the lifetime of a young embedded protostar, micron-sized grains can grow, and locally the dust size distribution deviates significantly from the MRN initial shape. This new numerical method opens the perspective to treat simultaneously gas/dust dynamics and dust growth in 3D simulations at a low numerical cost for several astrophysical environments.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Models the heliocentric dust ring co-orbital with Venus to estimate particle distributions and spacecraft impact risk, with only marginal relevance to origins-of-life or astrobiology beyond Solar System context.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2504.16610v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: A heliocentric dust ring on Venus orbit was discovered following observations by the Helios spacecraft, and then confirmed thanks to observations by STEREO and the Parker Solar Probe. The impact risk it poses needs to be evaluated for any spacecraft crossing the ring. This study aims to provide a first model of the dust ring, in terms of distribution of particles (including size distribution), velocity, density of the ring, and deduce a first estimation of the impact risk to spacecrafts crossing the ring. We seek to describe the orbits of dust particles in the ring. We explore a first simple model, that leads us to propose a second, more elaborate, model. This model is then populated by particles that we integrate for 2000 years. We demonstrate that the dust ring will persist over the next 2000 years, only slightly extending radially and perpendicularly to the Venus orbital plane. We show that particles tend to accumulate at Venus orbit, but that along it the differences in density is negligible. We compute the number of particles we can expect to find in the ring. Finally, as an example, we apply this model to Bepi-Colombo to obtain a first estimate of the impact flux in function of radius and mass, for radii between 2 $\mu$m and 2 cm (i.e. for masses between 10^-2 kg and 10^-14 kg). We also present the impact velocity and direction of impacts with respect to Bepi-Colombo. We are able to conclude that the ring seems to present a low risk for spacecrafts using Venus as a gravity assist.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a neural-operator framework (DyMixOp) for improved PDE forecasting via a local-global mixing transformation and dynamics-informed design, with no direct connection to origins-of-life or astrobiology topics.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2508.13490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is transforming these systems into a suitable format, especially when dealing with non-linearizable dynamics or the need for infinite-dimensional spaces for linearization. This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework for PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address this challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent space, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear interactions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in turbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details and nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in existing neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a dynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate linear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical systems. Experimental results across diverse PDE benchmarks demonstrate that DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing prediction errors, particularly in convection-dominated scenarios reaching up to 86.7\%, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> A condensed-matter study showing impurity-induced chirality reversal and topological transitions in a Haldane-defect honeycomb lattice, with only indirect relevance to origins-of-life questions via the general concept of chirality.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2510.11707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: We study the honeycomb lattice with a single magnetic impurity modeled by adding imaginary next-nearest-neighbor hopping ih on a single hexagon. This Haldane defect gives a topological mass term to the gapless Dirac cones and generates chirality. For a small density of defects Neehus et al [arXiv:2405.19289] found that the system&#x27;s chirality reverses at a critical hc ~ 0.95 associated with an unexpected tri-critical point of Dirac fermions at zero defect density. We investigate this zero-density limit by analyzing a single defect and computing two experimentally relevant measures of chirality: (1) orbital magnetization via local Chern marker, a bulk probe of all occupied states; and (2) electronic currents of low-energy states. Both probes show a chirality reversal at a critical hc ~ 0.9--1. Motivated by this consistency we propose a defect-scale toy model whose low energy states reverse their chirality at hc&#x27; ~ 0.87. Remarkably, the same pair of zero energy bound states also generate the critical point hc in the full impurity projected T-matrix. Our results show how the chirality reversal produced by an impurity can be observed either in local probes or in the global topology and suggest a possible role of the microscopic defect structure at the critical point.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06620v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The study of global-in-time dynamics of vacuum is crucial for understanding viscous flows. However, the corresponding large-data problems for multidimensional spherically symmetric flows have remained open, due to the coordinate singularity at the origin and the strong degeneracy on the moving boundary. In this paper, we analyze the vacuum free boundary problem for the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate density-dependent viscosity coefficients (as in the shallow water equations) in two and three spatial dimensions. We prove that, for a general class of spherically symmetric initial density: $\rho_0^{\beta}\in H^3$ with $\beta\in (\frac{1}{3},\gamma-1]$ ($\gamma$: adiabatic exponent) vanishing on the moving boundary in the form of a distance function, no vacuum forms inside the fluid in finite time, and we establish the global well-posedness of classical solutions with large initial data. Particularly, when $\beta=\gamma-1$, the initial density contains a physical vacuum, but fails to satisfy the condition required for the Bresch-Desjardins (BD) entropy estimate when $\gamma\ge 2$. Our analysis is mainly based on a region-segmentation method: near the origin, we develop an interior BD entropy estimate, thereby obtaining flow-map-weighted estimates for the density; while, near the boundary, we construct $\rho_0$-weighted estimates for the effective velocity, which differ fundamentally from the classical BD entropy estimates and yield novel flow-map-weighted estimates for both the fluid and the effective velocities. These estimates enable us to obtain the uniform upper bound for the density and show that no cavitation occurs inside the fluid. The methodology developed here should also be useful for solving other related nonlinear equations involving similar difficulties.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06233v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Exoplanet atmosphere characterization has seen revolutionary advances over the last few years, providing us with unique insights into atmospheric chemistry, dynamics and planet formation mechanisms. However, true solar system analog planets remain inaccessible. A major goal for exoplanet science over the coming decades is to observe, and characterize, temperate rocky planets and cool gas giants in orbit around solar-type stars, with the prospect of detecting signs of habitability or even life. Characterization and categorization of these planets relies on direct spectroscopic observations capable of identifying molecular species in their atmospheres; however, these observations represent a substantial engineering challenge due to the extreme contrast between a temperate, Earth-sized exoplanet and its parent star. NASA&#x27;s next flagship mission, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) - planned for launch in the mid-2040s - will boast a coronagraphic instrument capable of reaching the needed 10$^{-10}$ contrast, on an ultrastable platform enabling long integration times to achieve the required signal to noise. HWO will cover near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared wavelengths, enabling detections of key biosignature molecules and habitability indicators such as ocean glint and a vegetation `red edge&#x27;. Via early involvement in this groundbreaking observatory, including a potential UK instrument contribution, the UK exoplanet community now has an important opportunity to influence the telescope&#x27;s design. To maintain our international competitiveness, we must be at the forefront of observational campaigns with HWO when it eventually launches, and this comes with the need for parallel development in laboratory astrophysics and computational modelling. Maximising our exploitation of this transformative NASA mission requires consistent financial support in these areas across the next two decades.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.02106v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs), particularly those with cometary activity, provide unique insight into the primordial physical and chemical conditions present during the formation of the planetary system in which they originated. Observations in the sub-mm regime allow for direct measurements of several parent molecules released from the comet nucleus into the coma. Here we present observations of the third ISO, 3I/ATLAS, with the `\=U`\=u heterodyne receiver on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), which targeted emission from HCN($J = 3 - 2$) and CO($J = 2 - 1$). Our observations, taken between 16 July 2025 and 21 July 2025 (UT), when 3I/ATLAS was at a heliocentric distance between 4.01 and 3.84 au, provide the earliest sub-mm constraints on its activity. We do not detect HCN or CO in these epochs, with 3$\sigma$ upper-limits on the production rates of $Q(HCN) &lt; 1.7 \times 10^{24}$ s$^{-1}$ at $r_h = 4.01 - 3.97$ au and $Q(CO) &lt; 1.1 \times 10^{27}$ s$^{-1}$ at $r_h = 3.94 - 3.84$ au, respectively. We combine this HCN limit with later JCMT observations of HCN to constrain its temporal evolution. Fitting the HCN detections with a $Q(HCN) \propto r_h^{-n}$ model and accounting for the upper-limits yields $n = 12.7^{+6.9}_{-2.5}$. This slope is steeper than those of typical Solar System comets, but consistent with the production rate slopes measured for other species in the coma of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:1505.07594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: The mechanisms of cold- and pressure-denaturation of proteins are matter of debate and are commonly understood as due to water-mediated interactions. Here we study several cases of proteins, with or without a unique native state, with or without hydrophilic residues, by means of a coarse-grain protein model in explicit solvent. We show, using Monte Carlo simulations, that taking into account how water at the protein interface changes its hydrogen bond properties and its density fluctuations is enough to predict protein stability regions with elliptic shapes in the temperature-pressure plane, consistent with previous theories. Our results clearly identify the different mechanisms with which water participates to denaturation and open the perspective to develop advanced computational design tools for protein engineering.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07719v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) is a central tool for studying the dynamical electronic structure of molecules and solids, yet aspects of its mathematical foundations remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we revisit the foundations of TDDFT within a finite-dimensional setting by developing a general geometric framework for Schr\&quot;odinger dynamics subject to prescribed expectation values of selected observables. We show that multiple natural definitions of such constrained dynamics arise from the underlying geometry of the state manifold. The conventional TDDFT formulation emerges from demanding stationarity of the action functional, while an alternative, purely geometric construction leads to a distinct form of constrained Schr\&quot;odinger evolution that has not been previously explored. This alternative dynamics may provide a more mathematically robust route to TDDFT and may suggest new strategies for constructing nonadiabatic approximations. Applying the theory to interacting fermions on finite lattices, we derive novel Kohn--Sham schemes in which the density constraint is enforced via an imaginary potential or, equivalently, a nonlocal Hermitian operator. Numerical illustrations for the Hubbard dimer demonstrate the behavior of these new approaches.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07583v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Nonequilibrium electronic forces play a central role in voltage-driven phase transitions but are notoriously expensive to evaluate in dynamical simulations. Here we develop a machine learning framework for adiabatic lattice dynamics coupled to nonequilibrium electrons, and demonstrate it for a gating induced insulator to metal transition out of a charge density wave state in the Holstein model. Although exact electronic forces can be obtained from nonequilibrium Green&#x27;s function (NEGF) calculations, their high computational cost renders long time dynamical simulations prohibitively expensive. By exploiting the locality of the electronic response, we train a neural network to directly predict instantaneous local electronic forces from the lattice configuration, thereby bypassing repeated NEGF calculations during time evolution. When combined with Brownian dynamics, the resulting machine learning force field quantitatively reproduces domain wall motion and nonequilibrium phase transition dynamics obtained from full NEGF simulations, while achieving orders of magnitude gains in computational efficiency. Our results establish direct force learning as an efficient and accurate approach for simulating nonequilibrium lattice dynamics in driven quantum materials.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> The paper introduces a modified Moran process where “replacer” mutants avoid wasted reproduction by preferentially replacing other types, showing substantially increased fixation and invasion resistance—results broadly relevant to evolutionary dynamics but only indirectly to Origins of Life.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.04417v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Evolution occurs in populations of reproducing individuals. In stochastic descriptions of evolutionary dynamics, such as the Moran process, individuals are chosen randomly for birth and for death. If the same type is chosen for both steps, then the reproductive event is wasted, because the composition of the population remains unchanged. Here we introduce a new phenotype, which we call a replacer. Replacers are efficient competitors. When a replacer is chosen for reproduction, the offspring will always replace an individual of another type (if available). We determine the selective advantage of replacers in well-mixed populations and on one-dimensional lattices. We find that being a replacer substantially boosts the fixation probability of neutral and deleterious mutants. In particular, fixation probability of a single neutral replacer who invades a well-mixed population of size $N$ is of the order of $1/\sqrt N$ rather than the standard $1/N$. Even more importantly, replacers are much better protected against invasions once they have reached fixation. Therefore, replacers dominate the mutation selection equilibrium even if the phenotype of being a replacer comes at a substantial cost: curiously, for large population size and small mutation rate the relative fitness of a successful replacer can be as low as $1/e$.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06510v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Heterogeneous nucleation is the main path to ice formation on Earth. The ice nucleating ability of a certain substrate is mainly determined by both molecular interactions and the structural mismatch between the ice and the substrate lattices. We focus on the latter factor using molecular simulations of the mW model. Quantifying the effect of structural mismatch alone is challenging due to its coupling with molecular interactions. To disentangle both factors, we use a substrate composed of water molecules in such a way that any variation on the nucleation temperature can be exclusively ascribed to the structural mismatch. We find that a one per cent increase of structural mismatch leads to a decrease of approximately 4 K in the nucleation temperature. We also analyse the effect of the orientation of the substrate with respect to the liquid. The three main ice orientations (basal, primary prism and secondary prism) have a similar ice nucleating ability. We finally asses the effect of lattice flexibility by comparing substrates where molecules are immobile with others where a certain freedom to fluctuate around the lattice positions is allowed. Interestingly, we find that the latter type of substrate is more efficient in nucleating ice because it can adapt its structure to that of ice.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07193v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Attosecond science is an emerging topic where chirality plays a central role. Here we demonstrate that subjecting iodoacetylene,a geometrically achiral molecule, to a pair of simulated non-ionizing ultrafast circularly polarized laser pulses induces the fastest reversals of the continuously-valued S and R electronic chirality assignments to date, by two orders of magnitude (3.87 attoseconds). We partner the only vector-based quantum chemical physics theory enabling full symmetry-breaking with electronic and nuclear dynamics simulations: the former does not require charge density differences or special symmetry positions. The resulting &#x27;easy&#x27; and &#x27;hard&#x27; directions of the total electronic charge density motion are quantified as a cardioid-like morphology for the duration of the simulated laser pulses and toroidal afterwards.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07680v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Magnesium (Mg) has mechanical properties similar to bone tissue, and Mg ions take part in the metabolism. This makes Mg of interest for biocompatible degradable body implants, provided that its high corrosion rate can be inhibited. Slightly alloying Mg and adding surface coatings can slow down the corrosion processes without significantly changing the mechanical properties. Use of coating molecules that are native to the body increase the likelihood of making the surface biocompatible, for example by use of amino acids. We here present a density functional theory (DFT) study of the adsorption on Mg(0001) of the amino acids glycine, L-proline, and L-hydroxyproline (Hyp), the main amino acid content of collagen. We investigate how binding of the functional groups of Hyp are affected when Mg(0001) is slightly alloyed with zinc, lithium or aluminium, and we also model the immersion of the systems in a water environment to see how this affects the binding.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07719v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) is a central tool for studying the dynamical electronic structure of molecules and solids, yet aspects of its mathematical foundations remain insufficiently understood. In this work, we revisit the foundations of TDDFT within a finite-dimensional setting by developing a general geometric framework for Schr\&quot;odinger dynamics subject to prescribed expectation values of selected observables. We show that multiple natural definitions of such constrained dynamics arise from the underlying geometry of the state manifold. The conventional TDDFT formulation emerges from demanding stationarity of the action functional, while an alternative, purely geometric construction leads to a distinct form of constrained Schr\&quot;odinger evolution that has not been previously explored. This alternative dynamics may provide a more mathematically robust route to TDDFT and may suggest new strategies for constructing nonadiabatic approximations. Applying the theory to interacting fermions on finite lattices, we derive novel Kohn--Sham schemes in which the density constraint is enforced via an imaginary potential or, equivalently, a nonlocal Hermitian operator. Numerical illustrations for the Hubbard dimer demonstrate the behavior of these new approaches.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06995v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The distribution of ions and their impact on the structure of electrolyte interfaces plays an important role in many applications. Interestingly, recent experimental studies have suggested the preferential accumulation of $SO_4^{2-}$ ions at the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interface in disagreement with the generally known tendency of cations to accumulate at graphene-electrolyte interfaces. Herein, we resolve the atomistic structure of the $Na_2SO_{4,aq}$-graphene interfaces in the 0.1-2.0 M concentration range using machine learning interatomic potential-based simulations and simulated sum frequency generation (SFG) spectra to reveal the molecular origins of the conundrum. Our results show that Na+ ions accumulate between the outermost and second water layers whereas $SO_4^{2-}$ ions accumulate within the second interfacial water layer indicating cation dominated interfaces. We find that the interfacial region (within ~10 ${\AA}$ of the graphene sheet) is negatively charged due to sub-stoichiometric $Na^+$/$SO_4^{2-}$ ratio at the interface. Our simulated SFG spectra show enhancement and a red-shift of the spectra in the hydrogen bonded region as a function of $Na_2SO_4$ concentration similar to measurements due to $SO_4^{2-}$-induced changes in the orientational order of water molecules in the second interfacial layer. Our study demonstrates that ion stratification and ion-induced water reorganization are key elements of understanding the electrolyte-graphene interface.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07409v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Janus particles, with their intrinsic asymmetry, are attracting major interest in various applications, including emulsion stabilization, micro/nanomotors, imaging, and drug delivery. In this context, Janus polymersomes are particularly attractive for synthetic cell development and drug delivery systems. While they can be achieved by inducing a phase separation within their membrane, their fabrication method remains largely empirical. Here, we propose a rational approach, using Flory-Huggins theory, to predict the self-assembly of amphiphilic block copolymers into asymmetric Janus polymersomes. Our predictions are experimentally validated by forming highly stable Janus giant unilamellar vesicles (JGUVs) with a remarkable yield exceeding 90% obtained from electroformation of various biocompatible block copolymers. We also present a general phase diagram correlating mixing energy with polymersome morphology, offering a valuable tool for JGUV design. These polymersomes can be extruded to achieve quasi-monodisperse vesicles while maintaining their Janus-like morphology, paving the way for their asymmetric functionalization and use as active carriers.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.06089v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Understanding how biological soft matter responds to electromagnetic fields under ambient conditions remains a central challenge, as thermal fluctuations are generally expected to suppress long-range organization. Here, we report that hydrated DNA exhibits a reproducible magnetic-field-induced transition characterized by a sharp transverse-voltage threshold (40-50 mV), followed by a regime of regular, phase-stable oscillations in the transverse polarization signal. These features emerge only beyond the threshold and display a pronounced temperature dependence, consistent with the formation of a collective mode within the hydrogen-bond network of the DNA-water interface. Motivated by recent studies of Hall-like responses carried by neutral excitations, including phonons, magnons, and excitons, we interpret the observed transverse signal in terms of coherent polarization dynamics of proton-proton-hole dipoles confined to a quasi-two-dimensional hydrated layer. Within this framework, the transverse response is attributed to a field-organized polarization mode; the measured transverse voltage arises from collective dipolar dynamics rather than steady carrier transport. These results identify hydrated DNA as a soft-matter system in which magnetic field and temperature jointly modulate collective polarization dynamics, providing a biologically relevant platform for exploring coherence and transverse responses in hydrogen-bonded media.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Excited-state molecular dynamics reveals ultrafast pathways by which UV-irradiated liquid water generates hydrated electrons (and associated ion–radical pairs), a mechanistic advance relevant to prebiotic redox chemistry though not directly focused on specific origins-of-life systems.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2508.19702v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The photophysics and photochemistry associated with irradiating UV light in liquid water is central to numerous physical, chemical and biological processes. One of the key events involved in this process is the generation of the hydrated electron. Despite long study from both experimental and theoretical fronts, a unified understanding of the underlying mechanisms associated with the generation of the solvated electron have remained elusive. Here, using excited-state molecular dynamics simulations of condensed phase photoexcited liquid water, we unravel the key sequence of chemical events leading to the creation of the hydrated electron on the excited state. The process begins through the excitation localized mostly on specific topological defects in the hydrogen-bond network of water which is subsequently followed by two main reaction pathways. The first, leads to the creation of a hydrogen atom culminating in non-radiative decay back to the ground-state within 100 femtoseconds. The second involves a proton coupled electron transfer, giving rise to the formation of the hydronium ion, hydroxyl radical and the hydrated excess electron on the excited-state. This process is facilitated by ultrafast coupled rotational and translational motions of water molecules leading to the formation of water mediated ion-radical pairs in the network. These species can survive on the picosecond timescale and ultimately modulate the emission of visible photons. All in all, our findings provide fresh perspectives into the interpretation of several independent time-dependent spectroscopies measured over the last decades, paving the way for new directions on both theoretical and experimental fronts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2509.16257v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Stress, or pressure, is a central quantity in engineering and remains vital in molecular modelling. However, the commonly used virial stress tensor is invalid for an inhomogeneous fluid, which is essential in fluid dynamics and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulation. This is solved by using the method of planes (MoP), a mechanical form of pressure, simply interpreted as the force divided by area, yet is derived from the firm foundations of statistical mechanics. We present an extension of MoP stress1 to the MACE potential, a particular form of machine learning (ML) potentials allowing the incorporation of quantum mechanical (QM) physics into classical simulation. We present the derivation of this local stress for the MACE potential using the theoretical framework set out by Irving and Kirkwood 2 . For the test case of an interface between water and Zirconium Oxide, we show that the MoP measures the correct force balance while the virial form fails. Further, we demonstrate that this planar definition of stress is valid arbitrarily far from equilibrium, showing exact conservation every timestep in a control volume bounded by MoP planes. This links the stress directly to the conservation equations and demonstrates the validity in non equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) systems. All code to reproduce these validations for any MACE system, together with ASE accelerated code to calculate the MoP, is provided as open source. This work helps build the foundation to extend the ML revolution in materials to NEMD and molecular fluid dynamics modelling.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.14201v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Ultrafast charge transfer (CT) processes redistribute electronic charge within and between molecular units and play a central role in many physical, chemical, and biological phenomena. However, the microscopic pathways of multiple CT events, including the coupled structural evolution and energy redistribution, are challenging to disentangle experimentally in complex systems. To obtain controlled insight into such dynamics, well-defined properties are required. Here, we investigate the N2Ar dimer, which combines a covalent bond with a weak van der Waals interaction, using site-selective synchrotron photoionization and coincident detection of electrons and ions. Combined with ab initio calculations, this approach enables step-by-step tracking of ultrafast CT and fragmentation dynamics. We find that the dimer&#x27;s structural evolution triggers a second CT event, opening complex reaction pathways in which electrons are transferred back and forth between Ar and N2, through two nonadiabatic transitions involving conical intersections. These results demonstrate that sequential multiple CT-induced transitions, even in a simple dimer, provide controlled insight into nonadiabatic reaction mechanisms relevant to complex systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.07457v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Small aromatic molecules, including functionalized derivatives of benzene, are known to be present throughout the different stages of star and planet formation. In particular, oxygen-bearing monosubstituted aromatics, likely including phenol, have been identified in the coma of comet 67P. This suggests that, earlier in the star and planet formation evolution, icy grains may act as both reservoirs and sites of functionalization for these small aromatics. We investigate the ice-phase reactivity of singlet oxygen atoms (O($^1$D)) with benzene, using ozone as a precursor that is readily photodissociated by relatively low-energy. Our experiments show that O($^1$D) efficiently reacts with benzene, forming phenol, benzene oxide, and oxepine as the main products. Phenol formation is temperature-independent, consistent with a barrierless insertion mechanism. In contrast, the formation of benzene oxide/oxepine shows a slight temperature dependence, suggesting that additional reaction pathways involving either ground-state or excited-state oxygen atoms may contribute. In H$_2$O and \COO ice matrices we find that dilution does not suppress formation of phenol. We extrapolate an experimental upper limit for the benzene-to-phenol conversion fraction of 27-44$\%$ during the lifetime of an interstellar cloud, assuming O($^1$D) production rates based on CO$_2$ ice abundances and a cosmic-ray induced UV field. We compare these estimates with a new analysis of data from the comet 67P, where the C$_6$H$_6$O/C$_6$H$_6$ ratio is 20$\pm$6$\%$. This value lies within our estimated range, suggesting that O($^1$D)-mediated chemistry is a viable pathway for producing oxygenated aromatics in cold astrophysical ices, potentially enriching icy planetesimals with phenol and other biorelevant compounds.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2505.23460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) manifests as a forward-backward asymmetry of electron emission in the direction orthogonal to the light polarization plane via one-photon ionization of chiral molecules with circularly polarized light. Multi-polar `PECD&#x27; currents, i.e., currents resolved along multiple directions, have also been predicted using two mutually-orthogonal linearly polarized light with carrier frequencies $\omega$ and $2\omega$. These currents arise from the interference between the one- and two-photon transitions. Here, we will show that photoelectron spin detection already reveals enantio-sensitive multi-polar currents in the one-photon regime since the two axes can be marked by the photoelectron momentum $\unitvec{k}$ and spin-detection axis $\unitvec{s}$. Specifically, we consider one-photon ionization of an isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules and show that the direction of the resulting photoelectron current is enantio-sensitively `locked&#x27; to the photoelectron&#x27;s spin, which is mediated by two mechanisms. First, is the Bloch pseudovector which enables a collinear locking forming either a spin-sink or source for opposite enantiomers. Second, is the spin torque pseudovector that enables orthogonal locking forming a spin vortex in the polarization plane that rotates in opposite directions for opposite enantiomers. The former effect is a spin analog of photoelectron vortex dichroism (\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.233201}{Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{129}, 233201, 2022}) wherein the detected photoelectron spin encodes molecular chirality while the latter is reminiscent of the Rashba effect in solids</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study maps nonsense-mediated mRNA decay targets in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes using SMG1 inhibition and RNA-seq, offering cell-type-specific insights into eukaryotic RNA surveillance but little direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) serves as a mechanism to suppress the expression of mutant alleles containing premature termination codons, limit the expression of aberrantly spliced transcript isoforms, and control the expression of numerous regular genes. While the principles by which NMD recognizes target transcripts are well understood, much less is known about the range of mRNAs subject to NMD in tissues and specialized cell types. Here we describe the landscape of genes whose expression is controlled by NMD in cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-CM), using small read RNA sequencing in combination with a potent inhibitor of SMG1, a kinase essential for NMD. We find that NMD targets are highly conserved between iPSC-CM lines derived from two healthy individuals. Beyond gene level analysis, we identify individual exon and intron RNA sequences that strongly accumulate upon SMG1 inhibition. Using the cardiac NMD targets identified at gene, exon and intron level, we then demonstrate reduced NMD efficiency upon knockdown of two essential NMD factors, UPF1 and UPF2, in iPSC-CM. Our analysis demonstrates that quantifying the transcriptome-wide response to SMG1 inhibition represents a highly sensitive approach to assess global activity of the NMD pathway.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mitochondria possess their own mRNA translation system, mediated by specialized mitoribosomes. Dysregulation of mitochondrial translation disrupts metabolic homeostasis and is linked to various pathologies, including metabolic syndromes, neurological disorders, and cardiac diseases. Using CRISPR/Cas9 screening, we identified EOLA1 (endothelial-overexpressed lipopolysaccharide-associated factor 1) as a novel mitochondrial matrix protein essential for metabolic homeostasis. Knockout of Eola1 severely affects mitochondrial translation and consequently the oxidative phosphorylation in mammalian cells. Mechanistically, EOLA1 physically interacts with mitochondrial 12S ribosomal RNA (12S mt-rRNA) and the mitochondrial Tu translation elongation factor (TUFM), facilitating efficient translation elongation of mitochondrial-encoded mRNAs. Furthermore, genetic ablation of Eola1 in mice induced severe cardiac dysfunction, demonstrating its indispensable role in maintaining heart function through mitochondrial translation control. Together, our findings establish EOLA1 as a key regulator of mitochondrial translation via its interactions with 12S mt-rRNA and TUFM, highlighting its importance in cellular metabolism and a potential role in cardiac disease pathogenesis.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Circadian clocks in eukaryotes rely on precisely regulated negative feedback loops to generate daily rhythms. However, the delay mechanisms that extend this structurally simple feedback loop to ~24 hours are not yet fully understood. In the filamentous fungal model organism Neurospora crassa, the negative arm complex, centered by FREQUENCY (FRQ), must enter the nucleus to repress the White Collar Complex (WCC) and close the feedback loop, but the mechanisms and dynamics of its nuclear transport have remained unresolved. Using long-term live-cell imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we demonstrate that FRQ nuclear import is an active circadian-regulated process that is fastest early in the subjective day and progressively decreases as nuclear FRQ approaches peak levels, corresponding to altered direct binding between FRQ and Importin . We further establish that Importin is required for the spatial regulation of FRQ and WC-1 and the correct timing of Neurospora circadian clock. Analysis of the three Neurospora Importin {beta} homologs reveals that each of them contributes differently to the circadian clock through pathways beyond FRQ or WCC nuclear import. More specifically, we find a genetic interaction between Imp{beta}3 and the phosphatase PP-4. Together, these findings indicate that nuclear import is a selective, dynamic, and rate-limiting regulatory step in the fungal circadian clock and reveal both conserved and fungal-specific mechanisms by which importins tune circadian timing.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is a serious metabolic disorder characterised by hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin resistance. An increased rate of hepatic gluconeogenesis acts as one of the major contributors of the high blood glucose levels in the diseased condition. Transcriptional regulation is a main factor that controls gene expression. In this study we have elucidated how the transcriptional availability of the Cebpa gene can be modulated at the nucleosomal level through the post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histones using a series of coarse-grained multi-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations. The transcriptional status of a gene is influenced by a plethora of factors, but our work reveals that indeed histone PTMs are capable of modulating transcriptional output of genes at a structural level, independent of other regulatory factors. We have identified H2BK108Me2, a downregulated histone PTM mark found in a diet-induced obese mouse liver, to be essentially contributing in tackling gluconeogenic load by suppressing transcription of the Cebpa gene. We found that H2BK108Me2 induces the closure of the nucleosomal DNA ends through sliding and posing chromatin unavailability towards essential transcription factors of the gene.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Biophysical and structural analysis suggests phosphorylation-dependent intramolecular looping in the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein toggles compaction, self-association, and RNA/nucleic-acid binding, impacting RNP formation.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV-2 scaffolds genomic RNA into ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNP) for assembly in the virion, but also fulfills critical intracellular functions in replication and the suppression of host defense. It contains a folded nucleic acid binding domain (NTD) and a dimerization domain, connected by a disordered linker containing a serine/arginine-rich (SR) region and a leucine-rich sequence (LRS). The switch between intracellular and assembly functions is controlled by phosphorylation of the SR region, but the molecular details are unclear. Here we describe a model in which two mutually exclusive intramolecular loops bind the NTD and dynamically control self-association and nucleic acid binding properties dependent on the SR linker phosphorylation state. The model is supported by biophysical measurements of hydrodynamic radii, reversible protein self-association, nucleic acid binding, and thermodynamic stability, as well as structural predictions and published NMR chemical shifts. We find SR linker phosphorylation compacts the protein and inhibits nucleic acid binding and RNP formation, while enhancing self-association through promotion of transient coiled-coils in the LRS of the linker. These changes shift the nucleocapsid protein to a configuration poised for multi-valent interactions that support intracellular functions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Gene duplication has played a critical role in the evolutionary history of proteins, enabling complex multimers to emerge from simpler precursors. Yet in protein engineering, current methods for directed evolution do not exploit gene duplication, hampering access to the vast array of diverse variants that are only enriched in the presence of a wild-type copy. We establish a directed evolution strategy for multimeric proteins that harnesses gene duplication to compensate for metabolic burden and self-assembly fitness, allowing previously inaccessible variants to be enriched. Starting from a homomeric 240-mer capsid, gene duplication enables selection of both extreme homomeric variants and obligate heteromers. This strategy significantly expands engineering access to diverse high-performing variants, while also supporting a plausible model for evolutionary diversification of higher-order multimers in nature.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recruitment dynamics, or the distribution of the number of offspring among individuals, is fundamental to ecology and evolution. We take sweepstakes reproduction to mean a skewed (heavy right-tailed) offspring number distribution without natural selection being involved. Sweepstakes may be generated by chance matching of reproduction with favorable environmental conditions. Gene genealogies generated by sweepstakes reproduction are in the domain of attraction of multiple-merger coalescents where a random number of lineages merges at such times. We consider population genetic models of sweepstakes reproduction for haploid panmictic populations of both constant (N), and varying population size, and evolving in a random environment. We construct our models so that we can recover the observed number of new mutations in a given sample without requiring strong assumptions regarding the population size or the mutation rate. Our main results are (i) continuous-time coalescents that are either the Kingman coalescent or specific families of Beta- or Poisson-Dirichlet coalescents; when combining the results the parameter of the Beta-coalescent ranges from 0 to 2, and the Beta-coalescents may be incomplete due to an upper bound on the number of potential offspring an arbitrary individual may produce; (ii) in large populations we measure time in units proportional to either N/log N or N generations; (iii) incorporating fluctuations in population size leads to time-changed multiple-merger coalescents where the time-change does not depend on ; (iv) using simulations we show that in some cases approximations of functionals of a given coalescent do not match the ones of the ancestral process in the domain of attraction of the given coalescent; (v) approximations of functionals obtained by conditioning on the population ancestry (the ancestral relations of all gene copies at all times) are broadly similar (for the models considered here) to the approximations obtained without conditioning on the population ancestry.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The early branching eukaryotic parasite, Trypanosoma brucei, lives extracellularly in the mammalian host, where it expresses variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). Antigenic variation of VSGs allows the parasite to evade the host immune response while in the bloodstream. Upon transition to the tsetse fly vector, the parasite remodels its surface to express procyclin protein from a limited set of EP and GPEET genes. While the environmental signals that trigger the switch from expressing VSG genes to expressing EP and GPEET genes are known, the molecular mechanism that initiates transcription of the EP and GPEET genes during parasite differentiation to the procyclic stage within the tsetse is not well understood. Previous work has shown that the chromatin interacting bromodomain protein Bdf3 is absent from the pol I promoter of the EPlocus in bloodstream parasites, but appears there shortly after initiation of differentiation from the bloodstream to the procyclic stage. Here, we show that tethering of Bdf3 to the EP promoter using a dCas9-Bdf3 fusion protein and a guide RNA is sufficient to increase transcript levels of EP1 in bloodstream parasites, where the gene is normally silenced. This result supports the model that Bdf3 appears at the EP locus during differentiation to facilitate initiation of transcription, which is consistent with the role for Bdf3 as a transcriptional activator in other systems. Understanding gene regulatory mechanisms in this early branching eukaryote may help build a more complete picture for the conserved and unique features of gene regulatory proteins across diverse biological systems.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This preprint dissects how the RNA-binding protein FUS couples structured RNA-recognition with biomolecular condensation to shape nuclear RNP condensates and downstream DNA-damage response and RNA-processing programs, offering general principles of RNA–protein phase behavior but not directly addressing prebiotic origins-of-life mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are key regulators of gene expression and often contain intrinsically disordered regions that drive biomolecular condensation. Yet, how condensation affects RBP specificity and function remains poorly defined. Here, we use strategically designed point mutations to selectively impair canonical RNA-binding and condensation of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-linked RBP Fused in Sarcoma (FUS). Using automated high-content imaging, we show that both properties shape nuclear ribonucleoprotein condensates and govern distinct aspects of FUS function in the DNA damage response. Transcriptome-wide mapping of FUS-RNA interactions reveals that the canonical RNA-binding domains recognise G-rich and C-rich motifs, whereas condensation selectively enhances binding to G-rich and structured sequences, often acting in concert with canonical RNA-binding to control transcriptional programs and splicing decisions. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for how FUS integrates condensation with sequence-specific RNA recognition to orchestrate nuclear organisation, genome stability and RNA metabolism. Furthermore, our rigorously validated mutants offer a platform for future mechanistic dissection of ALS pathogenesis and the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Using high-coverage family genomics, this preprint maps sex-specific crossover and non-crossover recombination hotspots in coppery titi monkeys, informing primate molecular evolution but offering minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Along with germline mutations, meiotic recombination plays a fundamental role in shaping genetic diversity and thus directly influences a species&#x27; potential adaptive response to environmental change, amongst other features. Despite the recombination landscape being of central importance for a variety of questions in molecular evolution, the genome-wide distribution and frequency of recombination remains to be elucidated in many non-human primate species. Utilizing novel high-coverage genomic data from three multi-sibling families, we here provide the first estimates of the rates and patterns of crossover and non-crossover recombination in coppery titi monkeys (Plecturocebus cupreus) - a socially monogamous, pair-bonded primate that serves as an important model in behavioral research. Consistent with haplorrhines, crossover and non-crossover recombination in this platyrrhine are frequently localized at PRDM9-mediated hotspots, characterized by a 15-mer binding motif with substantial similarities to the degenerate 13-mer motif found in humans. The sex-averaged crossover rate in coppery titi monkeys is comparable with those of other primates; however, no significant difference in recombination rates was observed between the sexes, despite a pronounced maternal age effect in the species. Similarities also exist with regards to the sex-specific genomic distribution of non-crossover events, though the minimal conversion tract lengths of extended events was observed to be considerably longer in maternally-inherited non-crossovers. Taken together, these similarities and differences in the recombination landscape relative to other primates highlight the importance of incorporating species-specific rates and patterns in evolutionary models, and the resources provided here will thus serve to aid future studies in this important primate model system.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids have shown great promise as delivery vectors for gene therapy. However, the natural properties of AAV capsids impose significant limitations on their efficacy. While capsid library screening and directed evolution have facilitated the development of improved vectors, current methods for generating AAV libraries frequently yield nonviable variants that fail to assemble or package DNA. Here, we propose a viability-guided diffusion model AAVDiffusion for de novo viable AAV capsid design. AAVDiffusion iteratively denoises Gaussian vectors into vectors of AAV capsid protein sequences, yielding intermediate latent variables. By leveraging the continuous nature of these latent variables, AAVDiffusion integrates an additional viability classifier that applies gradient updates to enhance the generation of viable AAV sequences. Through extensive computational tests, AAVDiffusion exhibits superior performance in generating viable AAV sequences. Furthermore, 196 AAV candidates were identified through a selection workflow, with the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier, thereby offering safer and more effective gene therapies for brain diseases. AAVDiffusion offers a powerful and efficient computational method for designing viable AAV capsids, advancing the development of AAV vectors for gene therapy.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Using inbreeding-derived autozygous segments, this study estimates an elevated germline DNA mutation rate in the tiny, isolated Devils Hole pupfish, lending support (at an extreme) to the drift-barrier hypothesis for mutation-rate evolution.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mutation rates vary by three orders of magnitude across eukaryotes. The drift-barrier hypothesis proposes that drift overwhelms selection for lower mutation rates in small populations, leading to higher mutation rates over time due to gradual accumulation of mutator alleles. Here, we test this hypothesis in the smallest long-term isolated population in the world, the critically endangered Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis). We estimated germline mutation rates in embryonic lethal and adult populations using autozygous segments caused by recent inbreeding events. Our estimate, 8.09 x 10^(-9) per base pair per generation, is significantly higher than the average rate for actinopterygian fishes of 5.97 x 10^(-9) (95% CI = 4.39 x 10^(-9)- 7.55 x 10^(-9)) and is lower than expected but still consistent with predictions from the drift-barrier hypothesis of 1.23 x 10^(-8) (95% CI = 7.81 x 10^(-9)- 1.93 x 10^(-8)), based on a recent meta-analysis of vertebrate mutation rates by Bergeron et al. (2023). We find that embryonic lethal individuals have a higher mutation rate than mature adults, potentially reflecting a segregating lethal mutator allele or damage to the cellular environment during embryo death. We also analyzed the mutational spectra of germline mutations and find that spectra between embryonic lethal and mature adults were similar, as is the spectra in Devils Hole pupfish and other fishes, despite differences in environmental temperature and oxygen stresses. Mutation rates in this critically endangered species provide new insights at one extreme into the mechanisms driving mutation rate variation across vertebrates.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Coarse-grained simulations extend Helical Coherence Theory to flexible, confined dsDNA and show that confinement and ionic conditions can promote protein-independent homologous DNA pairing with microsecond kinetics and distinct fraying/bubble formation modes.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> How can protein-independent, side-by-side alignment of homologous double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) arise as an early step in genome repair and genetic exchange, and what determines their kinetics under confinement? Although recombination proteins are known to facilitate this process, experiments indicate that an initial side-by-side arrangement of homologs can occur even in their absence. Helical Coherence Theory (HCT) proposes that sequence-dependent distortions of the double helix lead to commensurate charge patterns between interacting dsDNAs, favouring homologous over non-homologous alignment. However, HCT has largely been developed for straight, rigid dsDNA rods, an approximation limited to roughly one persistence length (lB {approx} 50 nm), leaving the question open as to how recognition manifests in longer, fluctuating chains. Moreover, the dynamics and timescales of homolog searching under confinement, and the internal dynamics of the paired state, such as transient formation of local unpaired regions (&quot;bubbles&#x27;&#x27;) and end fraying, remain unexplored. Here we extend HCT to dsDNA chains of multiple persistence lengths under confinement using coarse-grained simulations with a custom HCT-based force field, in order to come closer to understanding how homologous genes pair in vivo. We simulate two homologous chains within spherical cavities of radii 0.3-1 times their free-space gyration radius under two limiting ionic conditions. We found that confinement warrants homologous pairing; it occurs on microsecond timescales and depends non-monotonically on confinement size, with an optimal confinement that accelerates pairing while avoiding tangled states and metastable trapping in an ion-dependent manner. To resolve pairing dynamics, we develop a kinetic theory and fit it to simulation trajectories, distinguishing rates of independent pairing modes underlying bubble formation and fraying. Together, these results support a physical mechanism for homologous pairing beyond the rigid-rod limit and suggest how confinement can promote both encounter and stabilisation within the HCT framework.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Demonstrates fully programmable, reversible control of macroscopic helicity in dopant-free inorganic self-assembly via airflow shear, offering a useful physical model for studying how chiral organization could emerge without biological templating.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We report the controlled synthesis of fully programmable macroscopic chirality in hierarchical inorganic assemblies through the introduction of directional spiral airflow during evaporation-induced self-assembly of sub-1 nm gadolinium oxyhydroxide (GdOOH) nanowires. Extending previous observation of spontaneous centimeter-scale macroscopic helical assemblies (MHAs) without chiral dopants and with random handedness, we demonstrated 100% deterministic control over helicity, with left- or right-handed structures formation depending on the direction of airflow. This effect is independent of gas composition, confirming a purely mechanical shear-driven mechanism. Moreover, the resulting MHAs can be readily dissolved to regenerate the homogenous nanowire dispersion, allowing repeated cycles of assembly with inverted handedness and creating true dynamic programmability in a dopant-free inorganic system. This simple yet strong approach overcomes the random nature of macroscopic inorganic chirality, revealing supramolecular-like reversibility. These findings open new pathways for engineerable chiroptical materials with potential applications in photonics, catalysis, and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Zebrafish and medaka are powerful cardiovascular models, yet cellular and molecular investigations of adult heart cells have been constrained by suboptimal dissociation and characterization methods. To overcome these barriers, we developed a physiological-temperature workflow that generates high-yield, viable single-cell suspensions for FACS, imaging, and low-input molecular profiling. Using transgenic fluorescent reporters, we consistently isolate ~6,000 cardiomyocytes per adult zebrafish ventricle and ~12,000 from medaka, preserving cellular, structural, and molecular integrity. Single-cell morphometrics revealed cardiomyocyte heterogeneity and demonstrated that swimming exercise induces both hypertrophy and hyperplasia, while ventricular injury triggers expansion of regenerative gata4 cardiomyocytes. We integrated proteomics and RNA-seq from FACS-purified cells to construct cell-type-specific proteo-transcriptomic atlases. Functional enrichment, transcription factor, and network analyses identified protein hubs and regulatory circuits defining cardiomyocyte and endothelial cell identity. Our platform delivers cell-type-resolved molecular datasets of adult teleost cardiac cells, establishing a systems-level resource for heart regeneration research, cardiovascular disease modeling, and drug discovery.</p>

Over one full seasonal cycle, we measured N2O concentration and site-specific isotopomer compositions to assess spatio-temporal dynamics. Both basins showed near-neutral N2O exchange with the atmosphere, without clear seasonal patterns of N2O emission versus uptake (average air-water exchange flux of 0.04 ± 0.3 µmol m-2 d-1). Keeling-plot analysis indicated a nitrification-driven N2O source in the oxic water column in both basins, as inferred from its position-specific isotopic nitrogen composition. In the anoxic water column in the North Basin, N2O was persistently depleted, whereas in the deep South Basin N2O consumption was observed only during late-stage stratification. Net N2O consumption in the hypolimnia of both basins was accompanied by isotopic shifts toward lighter δ15Nbulk and δ15Nβ values, contrary to trends observed in pure cultures. These inverse apparent isotope effects suggest concurrent N2O production during net consumption. Using a simplified box-model (i.e., isotope mass balance) approach, we estimated that 5-17% of the consumed N2O needed to be replaced by simultaneous N2O production in order to match the observed in situ δ15Nbulk-N2O data. Our findings highlight the complexity of N2O cycling in lake systems and reveal that isotopic overprinting from simultaneous N2O production and consumption can obscure traditional isotope-based interpretations. At the same time, they underscore the value of stable isotopes in disentangling N2O production and consumption mechanisms.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Structural coloration is a physical phenomenon observed in many living organisms, including seaweeds, via the formation of highly organized nanostructures. Although a widespread system is characterized by the deposition of multilayer thin-film in the extracellular matrix (ECM), enabling light interference, to date such lamellae have only been described in the cuticle of red algae belonging to the Gigartinaceae family within macroalgae. Here, we determine the composition of the multilayered cuticle components in the model species Chondrus crispus (Rhodophyta), using genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and analytical profiling of carbohydrates. The complex structural assembly revealed common features with the ECM of animals. The carbohydrate fraction consists of a complex mixture of ECM carrageenans and glycosaminoglycan-like structures. A major von Willerbrand factor A domain (VWA) protein plays a critical role for the adhesion of macromolecules, including protein-protein interactions and to sulfated polysaccharides. We propose the name of Lamellae Cohesive Protein (LCP) regarding the alternate distribution of chemically distinct constituents within the cuticle. For the first time, we identified major proteins of the algal cuticle, providing a framework for addressing the evolutionary origins of the algal cuticle biosynthesis and raise important questions regarding its role, particularly across the life cycle marked by major structural ECM modifications.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a leading cause of death from infectious disease. Infected cells secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs), nanosized membrane-bound particles containing bioactive molecules known to mediate intercellular communication and influence immune regulation during infection. We hypothesized that EVs secreted from Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG)-infected macrophages could epigenetically reprogram naive monocytes and enhance their mycobactericidal activity against Mtb. A transwell co-culture system was used to enable communication via EVs and soluble factors, between BCG-infected macrophages and naive monocytes (recipient macrophages). To assess the impact of these factors, we examined epigenetic reprogramming and the ability to control Mtb growth. BCG-infected macrophages released EVs with a distinct proteomic profile mapping to multiple tuberculosis-related pathways. Recipient macrophages exhibited altered DNA methylation patterns compared to those co-cultured with untreated, Staphylococcus aureus-infected or hydrogen peroxide-exposed macrophages. The proteomic cargo of EVs and differentially methylated genes in recipient cells showed significant interactions with TNF as a central hub enriched in both the phagosome and tuberculosis pathway. The epigenetic reprogramming was accompanied by a trend towards improved control of Mtb in vitro. BCG infection induces release of EVs that, together with soluble factors, induce targeted epigenetic remodeling in recipient macrophages.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Centrosomes are complex organelles that comprise multiple copies of hundreds of different proteins, yet they can precisely duplicate every cell cycle. Here we reconstitute centrosome duplication on synthetic beads programmed to recruit core centrosome assembly proteins when injected into Drosophila embryos. These beads generate structures that are functionally indistinguishable from centrosomes: they recruit centriole/centrosome proteins, organise microtubules (MTs) and proceed through multiple rounds of high-fidelity duplication, all in synchrony with the endogenous centrosomes. The beads function as seeds that recruit biogenesis-promoting proteins to stimulate the assembly of relatively simple scaffolds that direct centrosome self-assembly. This &#x27;&#x27;Seed-Scaffold-Self-Assemble&#x27;&#x27; mechanism may represent a general principle of organelle biogenesis, explaining how simple molecular inputs can generate complex structures without the need to copy a pre-existing template.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> GenCore introduces an efficient Locally Consistent Parsing–based sketching method to estimate genomic distances and reconstruct phylogenies from assemblies or reads, which is broadly relevant to evolutionary genomics but not directly to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In the era of exponential data generation, a fast, consistent, and efficient string processing technique is necessary to represent extensive genomic data. One of the earliest string processing techniques, predating MinHash and minimizer-based sketching, is Locally Consistent Parsing (LCP). This technique partitions an input string and identifies short, exactly occurring substrings called cores, which collectively cover the input string while maintaining Partition and Labeling Consistency. The iterative application of LCP yields progressively longer cores in a compressed format, thereby substantially enhancing the efficiency of genomic sequence representation and subsequent downstream analysis. We have previously developed LCPtools as the first iterative implementation of LCP for the DNA alphabet and demonstrated its effectiveness in identifying cores with minimal collisions. Here, we introduce GenCore, a computational method that leverages LCP cores for the first time to sketch and estimate genomic distances for closely related large genomes, and successfully reconstruct simulated progression trees. GenCore also successfully recapitulates primate phylogeny using both telomere-to-telomere (T2T) assemblies and the PacBio HiFi reads for assembly-free comparisons. Availability: GenCore is available at https://github.com/BilkentCompGen/gencore</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces SCALPEL, a computational pipeline to improve processing and atlas-scale analysis of spatial transcriptomics datasets (e.g., whole mouse brain) via better segmentation, filtering, registration, and imputation, with minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spatial transcriptomics enables the precise mapping of gene expression patterns within tissue architecture, offering unprecedented insights into cellular interactions, tissue heterogeneity, and disease pathology that are unattainable with traditional transcriptomic approaches. We present a tool for processing spatial transcriptomics data, SCALPEL (Spatial Cell Analysis, Labeling, Processing, and Expression Linking). SCALPEL is specifically designed to support the analysis of large, atlas-level datasets. Our new workflow features advanced 3D segmentation optimized for dense and heterogeneous tissues, refined filtering criteria, and transcriptome-based doublet detection to remove low-quality or artifactual cells. Cell type label transfer from existing taxonomies is further improved through updated filtering thresholds. Spatial domain detection is incorporated to capture local transcriptomic organization, and tissue sections are registered to the Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework version 3 (CCFv3) for precise anatomical alignment. Genome-wide expression imputation from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) further enriches the dataset. Crucially, we benchmark the performance of this updated pipeline against a previously published version of our whole-mouse-brain (WMB) dataset (Yao et al., 2023b), demonstrating substantial improvements in cell number, expression profile clarity, and spatial registration. These advances provide a robust foundation for downstream spatial analyses and set a new standard for large-scale spatial transcriptomics studies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Orthobunyavirus genus within the Peribunyaviridae family of enveloped arthropod-borne negative-sense RNA viruses includes species associated with serious or fatal disease in both animals and humans such as Schmallenberg, La Crosse and Oropouche viruses. Orthobunyaviruses (OBVs) are internalised into cells by endocytosis and release their genomes following fusion with late endosomal (LE) membranes, triggered by low pH of the luminal milieu. There is mounting evidence to suggest OBV endosomal escape is also influenced by potassium ions (K+), which increase in concentration as endosomes mature. Endosomal K+ flux is controlled by cellular K+ channels, and we previously showed that K+ channel blockade using broad spectrum pharmacological inhibition abrogates OBV infection, with virions trapped within the endosomes. However, the K+ channels regulating this process are unknown. Herein, to identify the K+ channels involved, we studied Bunyamwera virus (BUNV), the prototypical OBV, and screened a siRNA library targeting 342 human ion channels. We identified 19 K+ channels whose knockdown inhibited BUNV gene expression by over 50%, with at least seven channels affecting BUNV at the entry stage, suggesting they exert a combinatorial influence. Of these seven channels, we used both pharmacological inhibition and genetic channel manipulation to show that OBV escape from CD63- and Rab7-positive LEs is controlled by KCNJ2 (KIR 2.1), KCNJ13 (KIR7.1) and KCNMA1 (BKCa). These studies add to the understanding of host factors influencing OBV entry, regulation of endosomal ion flux, and could aid in the design or repurposing of therapeutics for the treatment of OBV-associated disease.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study maps how the splicing regulator RBM20 binds long neuronal pre-mRNAs and prevents nonproductive splicing to maintain cytoplasmic mRNA levels, but it is largely unrelated to origins-of-life questions beyond a very general connection to RNA biology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Precise coordination of molecular programs and neuronal growth governs the formation, maintenance, and adaptation of neuronal circuits. RNA metabolism has emerged as a key regulatory node of neural development and nervous system pathologies. To uncover cell-type-specific RNA regulators, we systematically investigated expression of RNA recognition motif-containing proteins in the mouse neocortex. Surprisingly, we found RNA-binding motif protein 20 (RBM20), an alternative splicing regulator associated with dilated cardiomyopathy, to be expressed in cortical parvalbumin interneurons and mitral cells of the olfactory bulb. Genome-wide mapping of RBM20 target mRNAs revealed that neuronal RBM20 binds pre-mRNAs in distal intronic regions. Loss of neuronal RBM20 has only modest impact on alternative splice isoforms but results in a significant reduction in an array of mature mRNAs in the neuronal cytoplasm. This phenotype is particularly pronounced for genes with long introns that encode synaptic proteins. We hypothesize that RBM20 ensures fidelity of pre-mRNA splicing by suppressing nonproductive splicing events in long neuronal genes. This work highlights a common requirement for RBM20-dependent transcriptome regulation in cardiomyocytes and neurons and demonstrates that a major genetic risk factor of heart disease impacts neuronal gene expression.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Comparative mathematical genomics of mammalian histamine GPCRs maps conserved motifs and subtype-specific divergence (keyword match: evolution) but has no direct relevance to origins-of-life or astrobiology questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Histamine receptors (HRH1--HRH4) are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate essential physiological functions, including neurotransmission, gastric acid secretion, immune regulation, and presynaptic autoregulation. Despite their importance, systematic comparative analyses across mammalian histamine receptor sequences remain scarce. In this study, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of HRH1--HRH4 across multiple mammalian species, integrating sequence homology, invariant residue mapping, amino acid substitutions, compositional frequencies, Shannon entropy, polystring distributions, intrinsic disorder profiling, and phylogenetic clustering. HRH2 and HRH1 were highly conserved among primates, HRH3 showed strong cohesion within rodents, while HRH4 exhibited pronounced divergence consistent with immune-related specialization. Invariant residues localized to transmembrane helices and activation motifs (D107, W428/Y431, NPxxY), underscoring strict evolutionary constraints on ligand binding, receptor stability, and G-protein coupling. Substitutions were confined to non-essential lipid-facing and loop regions, predominantly conservative in nature, enabling diversification without disrupting the GPCR fold. Amino acid frequency and entropy analyses revealed hydrophobic dominance with subtype-specific enrichment of polar residues, while disorder profiling identified HRH1 as the most dynamic and HRH2 as the most structurally constrained. Polystring analysis highlighted conserved motifs (WWW, PP) alongside subtype- and species-specific repeats, reflecting evolutionary strategies balancing receptor stability with adaptive flexibility. Phylogenetic clustering confirmed subtype-specific cohesion, with HRH3 and HRH4 forming compact clades, HRH1 showing moderate dispersion, and HRH2 forming the most isolated cluster. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that mammalian histamine receptor evolution is governed by conserved biophysical cores and selective variability, offering insights into structural conservation, functional diversification, and translational relevance for drug design and model selection.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Multiscale simulations offer a way to understand how polymer transformations proceed under realistic conditions, however existing workflows rely on empirically tuned parameters. The MUltiscale SImulation frameworK (MUSIK) integrates conformer analysis, density functional theory and high-level coupled-cluster energetics, and graph-based lattice kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) to generate chemically accurate, spatially and temporally resolved kinetic models for polymer transformations without parameter fitting. The present work introduces MUSIK as a reproducible workflow and provides a step-by-step tutorial that shows how to construct, run, and analyze a lattice kMC model for base-assisted dehydrochlorination of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), supported by post-processing scripts that automate kMC trajectory analysis and polymer-structure reconstruction. Tutorial results demonstrate how MUSIK links atomic energetics and local structure to macroscopic kinetics and structural evolution and reproduces key experimental observations for PVC dehydrochlorination. MUSIK is generalizable to arbitrary polymer chemistries and can provide practical recommendations for polymer recycling, upcycling, and materials design to address plastic-waste challenge.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a reusable ATR‑FTIR immuno‑infrared biosensor with reversible protein capture that can detect single‑amino‑acid substitutions, offering broadly relevant analytical capability but little direct connection to origins‑of‑life chemistry or early life processes.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Infrared spectroscopy provides label-free access to protein structure information with high sensitivity. Challenges in infrared spectroscopy include artifacts arising from temperature changes, baseline drifts and the strong water absorption, especially in difference spectroscopy, where signals are orders of magnitude smaller than the total absorbance. Previously, we introduced an ATR-based immuno-infrared sensor (iRS) based on sophisticated surface chemistry. This provides a stable platform for covalent protein immobilization and allows its application with body fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid or blood without unspecific background. It detects misfolding of small amounts of antigen (Abeta or alpha-synuclein) by binding to an antibody or antibody fragment, which allows for the diagnosis of various neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we extend this platform by introducing reversible binding via the NColE7/Im7 pair. Im7-tagged proteins are captured with sub-picomolar affinity and quantitatively released under mild conditions (high salt or low pH), allowing repeated capture-regeneration cycles with continuous spectral monitoring of the Im7 fusion protein. Using an Im7-antibody Fab fusion protein, we present a reusable immune-IR sensor that enables multiple measurements on the same surface. For example, different antibodies can be used for differential screening. Using alternating Im7 protein attachments to the internal reflection element, we further compare Im7 single point mutants to wild-type Im7 to resolve infrared signatures of specific amino acid substitutions. Difference spectra reveal the distinct tyrosine absorption associated with either the introduction or removal of a single tyrosine residue, providing the first proof-of-concept for difference spectroscopy with single-residue sensitivity based on complete protein exchange.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Reports synthesis, structures, and visible-light bandgaps of quaternary Cu(I)–rare-earth molybdates, advancing semiconductor crystal chemistry but with little direct relevance to origins-of-life or astrobiology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cuprous-oxide semiconductors have been growing in research interest because of their promising optical and catalytic properties for solar energy conversion. While much recent research has focused on binary and ternary cuprous oxides, the more structurally complex quaternary and higher systems remain significantly less explored. Crystal growth in the cuprous rare-earth (RE) molybdate system has been investigated using high temperature and arc-melting synthesis techniques. Prior studies show the formation of two closely related compounds in these systems, occurring as either Cu6RE4(MoO4)9 (Space group: R3c, No. 161; exclusive for RE = La) or CuRE(MoO4)2 (Space group: Pbca, No. 61; for RE = Nd and heavier REs). By contrast, our new synthetic investigations for RE = Ce and La demonstrate the crystallization of both structure types, i.e., as red-colored crystals of Cu6RE4(MoO4)9 (RE = La(1) or Ce(2)) and as yellow-colored crystals of CuRE(MoO4)2 (RE = La(3) or Ce(4)), as obtained by slow cooling from 950 oC and from arc-melting techniques, respectively. Both structures similarly consist of [MoO4]2- tetrahedra bridged either by highly-distorted CuO4 tetrahedra and CeO9 tricapped trigonal prisms in 1 and 2 or by T-shaped CuO3 and CeO8 square antiprisms in 3 and 4. Optical UV-Vis diffuse reflectance measurements on powders of CuRE(MoO4)2 for RE = La, Ce, Sm, Eu, and Yb show relatively larger direct bandgaps in the range of 2.36 to 2.47 eV, while the crystals of Cu6RE4(MoO4)9 for RE = La and Ce yield smaller indirect bandgaps of about 1.89 to 2.05 eV. Electronic structure calculations show bandgaps which stem predominantly from electronic transitions between the filled 3d10-based orbitals of the Cu(I) cations and the empty d-based orbitals of the Mo(VI) cations. Thus, the RE cations are found to have an indirect effect on the optical bandgaps via changes in the local coordination environments of each of these cations. The change in crystal structure, such as from Cu6Ce4(MoO4)9 to CuCe(MoO4)2, has a dramatically larger effect of decreasing the bandgap by ~0.4 to 0.5 eV as compared to only changing the RE cation within the same structure type. In summary, new synthetic investigation of the quaternary cuprous molybdates has elucidated the impact of RE cations on their crystal structures, compositions, and visible-light bandgaps, with the underlying relationships revealed via electronic structure calculations.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Revises Eyring absolute rate theory using a residual (intermolecular-interaction) framework and links activation parameters to excess-entropy scaling to better predict viscosity and self-diffusion in liquids including water, with indirect relevance to prebiotic transport environments.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Eyring&#x27;s absolute rate theory relates fluid flow with the activation energy necessary for a molecule to go from one equilibrium position to another. Developed nearly a century ago, it remains a powerful approach for understanding transport processes in liquids. This work presents a revision of Eyring&#x27;s theory by replacing the vaporization-based parts of the theory with a residual approach that conceptualizes transport as local (re)movement of molecules within the system rather than removal from it. In this new approach, the energy barrier corresponds to the difference between a molecule with and without intermolecular interactions, effectively treating it as the residual property related to an ideal gas reference state. Furthermore, we explore the physical connections between Eyring&#x27;s absolute rate theory and Rosenfeld excess entropy scaling, revealing that both approaches describe complementary aspects of the same transport phenomena. It is tempting to link both theories. The activation parameters in Eyring&#x27;s theory, particularly the energy of activation, are shown to relate to the residual entropy used in entropy scaling. This provides a pathway to establish entropy scaling on a more rigorous physical foundation while offering deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms governing viscous flow. In comparison to experimental data, the revised theory demonstrated significant predictive power for viscosity across a wide range of thermodynamic conditions and species, including associating liquids. Moreover, parameters are transferable to other properties, such as self-diffusion.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The emergence of polar nematic phases, such as the ferroelectric (N F ) and antiferroelectric (N X ) phases, has opened new frontiers in soft matter science. However, the relationship between molecular structure, intermolecular interactions, and the resulting macroscopic order remains poorly understood. This work investigates the molecular organization in the polar nematic phases of the nJK (n=1-5) homologous series using a combined approach of polarized Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, and Atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations. A central finding is the inadequacy of single-molecule DFT models to describe the system. While DFT accurately predicts vibrational band positions, it fails to replicate their experimental intensities, suggesting that intermolecular interactions are dominant. This is further corroborated by the anomalous temperature dependence of the average absorbance for parallel and perpendicular vibrations, which deviates significantly from simple density effects. Atomistic MD simulations of a multi-molecule system provide insight into this behavior, revealing the formation of locally ordered nanodomains driven by strong short- range correlations. Experimentally, we quantified the primary nematic order parameter (S), which follows a typical progression in the N phase but shows anomalous changes at the N-N X and N X -N F transitions, ultimately saturating at a high value of S ≈ 0.7 in the ferroelectric state. The difference between orthogonal absorbance components for perpendicular vibrations reveals a significant biaxiality order parameter (C) that increases upon cooling and exceeds 1 in the N F phase.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Sequence-controlled synthetic polymers are engineered to tune local chain dynamics and morphology for improved rare-earth chelation, offering a materials-science analogue to protein structure–function relationships but with only indirect relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chain dynamics govern the intricate behaviors of proteins, underpinning functions such as catalysis, recognition and stimulus response, and are an increasingly appreciated aspect of structure-function relationships. Analogously, manipulating chain dynamics and structure in abiotic polymers via sequence control is an exciting, yet underexplored, strategy for improving material functions. Here, we report a systematic study relating the sequence, structure, and dynamics of polymeric sequestrants to their binding affinity and selectivity for rare earth elements (REEs). A series of sequence-controlled polymers with metal chelating, solubilizing, and structure forming monomers was synthesized via multiblock polymerization, yielding compositionally identical polymers with spectroscopically resolved domains and distinct morphologies. Using a combination of small angle X-ray scattering and 19F NMR relaxometry measurements, we connected differences in polymer structure and dynamics to polymer sequence variables such as the patchiness (density) of the structure forming monomer and the location of the chelating monomer. Furthermore, we found that while all polymers in the series collapse more and have slower dynamics when binding REEs (lanthanum and lutetium) than calcium, these changes were sequence-dependent and localized to specific domains within the polymer. Notably, sequence-controlled polymers that exhibited the largest conformational and dynamic changes upon binding REEs also bound REEs with the greatest affinity and moderate selectivity. Collectively, these results establish a mechanistic link between monomer patterning, dynamics, morphology, and REE binding performance en route to the development of efficient and selective macromolecular chelators.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> A theoretical Marcus-type model proposes that partially solvated interfacial OH− can undergo concerted electron transfer to diverse acceptors in microdroplets, making redox reactions thermodynamically favorable and near-barrierless at the air–water interface—mechanistically relevant to prebiotic/interface chemistry but not directly focused on abiogenesis.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Microdroplet chemistry has emerged as a fascinating field. In particular, a plethora of unexpected oxidation and reduction reactions are observed at air–water interface with wide implications to chemical science and beyond. However, the explanation of microdroplet redox chemistry is challenging and controversial. Mechanistically, thermodynamic reversal over the bulk reaction, surprisingly fast kinetics (often less than milliseconds) and generality of a broad scope of substrates defy textbook understanding. Herein, we lay out a theoretical model of concerted interfacial electron transfer of OH- (partially solvated) + A^n → OH· (partially solvated) + A^{n-1}, rather than the conventional stepwise ionization-capture picture. Four different electron acceptors A^n (including a transition metal, an organic molecule, oxygen, ozone) are chosen to cover a wide range of experimental scenarios and chemical diversity. When A^n in the system is reduced upon receiving an electron, the accompanied product of OH· further serves as the oxidizing agent, capturing the intrinsic oxidative capacity of microdroplet. We then introduce a general energetic treatment to account for the partial solvation of OH- at heterogeneous water interface and develop a Marcus-theory-based reaction rate formalism that integrates the energetic distribution. We quantitatively analyze both the thermodynamic and the kinetic consequences of this model. For all four cases analyzed, the otherwise unfavorable thermodynamic penalty (ΔG° &gt; 0) for the bulk reaction is reversed at water interface (ΔG° &lt; 0) after a certain dehydration level. Remarkably, for all these cases, interfacial electron transfer becomes near-barrierless (ΔG° ≈ -λ, ΔG‡ ≤ 3 kcal/mol) for a substantial sub-population of partially solvated OH-. Thus, the water interface can prepare and gate a substantial donor population whose electrons are nearly ready to tunnel into a broad range of acceptors across the interface, which explains the surprisingly fast reaction rate observed in experiments. This model further predicts absolute rate constants that are in agreement with kinetic measurement on microdroplets. Finally, a phase diagram is constructed to depict the vast thermodynamic and kinetic (barrierless reaction) zones that are newly opened by the water interface, thus accounting for reaction generality. Despite its simplicity, this model provides a robust prediction for the rich redox chemistry at water interface.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study shows how ligand choice and copper nuclearity in discrete Mo–Cu sulfide clusters tune sulfur-centered hydrogen evolution thermochemistry and stability, offering a mineral-inspired catalyst framework potentially relevant to early Earth redox/energy chemistry but not directly addressing abiogenesis.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Heterobimetallic clusters comprising Group 6 thiometallates and earth-abundant transition metals are of significant interest for applications in laser technology, telecommunications, sensing, and catalysis. An advantage of clusters relative to the bulk-state materials is their tunable architecture, which enables precise modulation of physicochemical properties and reactivity through ligand and core structure manipulation. Recently, we reported the Mo–Cu cluster [Tp*MoS3(CuSPh)2]– ([1•(CuSPh)2]–; Tp* = tris(3,5-dimethylpyrazolyl)borate) as a discrete model of layered Cu2MoS4 and functional electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) via a sulfur-centered pathway. While the Tp* ligand was found to be essential for stabilizing the clusters and precluding the formation of reactive Mo-hydrides, the impact of copper ligation and nuclearity remained uncertain. Herein, we describe the synthesis and characterization of a series of derivatives, [1•(CuX)n]– and [1•(CuL)n]1–n, systematically varying the ancillary X- and L-type copper ligands. Single crystal XRD and 1H DOSY NMR analyses reveal that while nuclearities of n = 2-4 are accessible in the solid state, the higher-order clusters (n = 3, 4) exhibit significant solution-state lability. Electrocatalytic evaluations show that the new clusters are markedly less active for the HER than the thiophenolate parent. DFT calculations attribute this difference to the attenuated sulfur basicity and (in some cases) weaker S–H bonds that result from increased copper nuclearity, ancillary ligand donicity, or overall charge. Collectively, this work reveals that while copper ligation and nuclearity offer a modular approach to tuning HER thermochemistry, these changes also impact the cluster’s ability to maintain structural integrity under catalytic conditions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Presents ACCEL, an ML-guided self-driving lab that co-optimizes photoluminescence and XRD feedback to autonomously identify and stabilize phase-pure quasi-2D formamidinium halide perovskites.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Self-driving laboratories (SDLs) are poised to transform materials discovery by integrating automation with machine learning (ML) to accelerate data-driven experimentation. However, most SDL frameworks remain limited by single-feedback optimization and lack the multi-modal diagnostics needed to resolve both optical and structural evolution in complex hybrid systems. Here, we introduce ACCEL, an automated, ML-guided closed-loop platform for identifying and synthesizing target pure phases within quasi-2D halide perovskite systems. Using a ternary 3D:2D compositional space comprising 3D FAPbI3 and two Dion–Jacobson (DJ) spacer–based components, ACCEL optimizes the 3D:2D ratios to identify compositions that converge toward a structurally and optically stable α-FAPbI3-like phase within a quasi-2D design space. Automated in-situ photoluminescence (PL) is used to monitor crystallization kinetics in real time, revealing how the relative fraction of co-spacers governs nucleation rate and phase evolution during film formation. These kinetic insights are integrated with high-throughput synthesis, automated PL analysis, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) similarity metrics within a Gaussian Process–Bayesian Optimization framework to suppress phase heterogeneity and stabilize the target phase. Rather than targeting a predefined DJ layer number, ACCEL enables optimization based on user-defined optical and structural signatures, providing a generalizable route for autonomous phase discovery in complex hybrid materials.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Quantifying and differentiating the structural characteristics of clathrate hydrates at the molecular level is crucial for understanding the properties that underpin hydrate-based technologies. While useful, current approaches lack sufficient resolution to discern, e.g., interfacial and dynamical structures. In this study, we present an algorithm based on Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) that accurately identifies different water states coexisting within clathrate hydrates. A key novel component is an effective cavity-finder algorithm, which provides input to the clustering framework. The new algorithm detects hydrate cavities by analyzing the number and type of constituent molecular rings around voids. Integrating the new algorithm with widely used order parameters (e.g., F3, F4, and F4t) provides a powerful and accurate tool for analyzing hydrate structures at interfaces and phase transitions. The performance of the new algorithm is assessed for structure I (sI) CO2 hydrates and for structure II (sII) mixed CH4/Dioxane hydrates, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability across different clathrates. Crucially, the proposed algorithm enables us to identify partially ordered structures characteristic of the quasi-liquid layer, thereby capturing interfacial dynamics and molecular-scale details essential for understanding hydrates under realistic conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05514v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: As remarked by Boltzmann, the Second Law of Thermodynamics is notable for the fact that it is readily proved using elementary statistical arguments, but becomes harder and harder to verify the more precise the microscopic description of a system. In this article, we investigate one particular realization of the 2nd Law, namely Joule heating in a wire under electrical bias. We analyze the production of entropy in an exactly solvable model of a quantum wire wherein the conserved flow of entropy under unitary quantum evolution is taken into account using an exact formula for the entropy current of a system of independent quantum particles. In this exact microscopic description of the quantum dynamics, the entropy production due to Joule heating does not arise automatically. Instead, we show that the expected entropy production is realized in the limit of a large number of local measurements by a series of floating thermoelectric probes along the length of the wire, which inject entropy into the system as a result of the information obtained via their continuous measurements of the system. The decoherence resulting from inelastic processes introduced by the local measurements is essential to the phenomenon of entropy production due to Joule heating, and would be expected to arise due to inelastic scattering in real systems of interacting particles.</p>

In this work, we investigate the dynamics of a network of qubits where each edge corresponds to an independent two-qubit interaction. By applying tools from percolation theory, we study how entanglement dynamically spreads across the network. We show that the interplay between unitary evolution and spatially correlated disorder leads to a non-standard percolation phenomenology, significantly richer than uniform bond percolation and featuring hysteresis. A two-colour correlated bond percolation model, whose phase diagram is determined via numerical simulations and a mean-field theory, fully elucidates the physics behind this phenomenon.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05277v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: This article proposes a research and development direction that would lead to the creation of next-generation intelligent technical systems. A distinctive feature of these systems is their ability to undergo evolutionary change. Cognitive architectures are now one of the most promising ways to create Artificial General Intelligence systems. One of the main problems of modern cognitive architectures is an excessively schematic approach to modeling the processes of cognitive activity. It does not allow the creation of a universal architecture that would be capable of reproducing higher nervous functions without using a predetermined set of perception patterns. Our paper proposes an evolutionary approach to creating a cognitive architecture. The basis of this approach is the use of a functional core, which consistently generates the intellectual functions of an autonomous agent. We are considering a cognitive architecture that includes components, the interaction of which ensures the evolution of the agent. The discussion of the development of intelligence is carried out using the conceptual apparatus of semiotics. This allows us to consider the task of developing cognitive functions as a problem of establishing a connection between the Merkwelt and the Werkwelt through the creation of the Innenwelt. The problem of early postnatal ontogenesis is investigated on the basis of the theory of constructivism: we discuss the requirements for the functional core and its composition, as well as the mechanism that initiates the process of cognition.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05994v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Resilience is a property of social, ecological, social-ecological and biophysical systems. It describes the capacity of a system to cope with, adapt to and innovate in response to a changing surrounding. Given the current climate change crisis, ensuring conditions for a sustainable future for the habitability on the planet is fundamentally dependent on Earth System (ES) resilience. It is thus particularly relevant to establish a model that captures and frames resilience of the ES, most particularly in physical terms that can be influenced by human policy\footnote{See page 4 for examples of strategies}. In this work we propose that resilience can serve as a theoretical foundation when unpacking and describing metastable states of equilibrium and energy dissipation in any dynamic description of the variables that characterise the ES. Since the impact of the human activities can be suitably gauged by the planetary boundaries (PBs) and the planet&#x27;s temperature is the net result of the multiple PB variables, such as $\text{CO}_2$ concentration and radiative forcing, atmospheric aerosol loading, atmospheric ozone depletion, etc, then resilience features arise once conditions to avoid an ES runaway to a state where the average temperature is much higher than the current one. Our model shows that this runaway can be prevented by the presence of metastable states and dynamic friction built out of the interaction among the PB variables once suitable conditions are satisfied. In this work these conditions are specified. As humanity moves away from Holocene conditions, we argue that resilience features arising from metastable states might be crucial for the ES to follow sustainable trajectories in the Anthropocene that prevent it run into a much hotter potential equilibrium state.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05387v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: One of the key goals of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is to directly image about 25 potentially habitable exoplanets and determine their properties. This challenge will require a large survey of nearby, bright stars -- ~100 according to the Astro2020 Decadel Survey. To ensure the success of the mission and to help guide design decisions, the stellar multiplicity of the target stars must be well-understood. To this end, we present optical speckle imaging of stars in the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program (ExEP) provisional HWO star list, which is currently the Tier 1 target list for the HWO Target Stars and Systems Sub-Working Group. We obtained new observations using `Alopeke and Zorro at Gemini Observatory and queried the Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program Archive for archival observations, resulting in speckle imaging data for 80 of the 164 stars. We confirmed one candidate companion detected previously by Gaia (HD 90089) and obtained an ambiguous detection of a known companion (HD 212330). To examine our sensitivity to companions, we simulated stellar companions down to ~0.1 $M_{\odot}$ for each target and found that 75%-85% would be detected in our speckle images; the remaining simulated companions are either too faint or too close-in, and will require follow-up using other methods such as long-term spectroscopic measurements and space-based techniques. This work represents a first step towards surveying potential HWO targets for close-in stellar companions and helping to inform the target selection process for the HWO direct-imaging survey, bringing us closer towards the discovery of potential habitable worlds.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05480v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The abundances of atmospheric carbon species--carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4)--exert fundamental controls on the climate, redox state, and prebiotic environment of terrestrial planets. As exoplanet atmospheric characterization advances, it is essential to understand how these species are regulated on habitable terrestrial planets across a wide range of stellar and planetary conditions. Here, we develop an integrated numerical model that couples atmospheric chemistry, climate, and the long-term carbon cycle to investigate the atmospheric compositions of lifeless, Earth-like planets orbiting Sun-like (F-, G-, and K-type) stars. Our simulations demonstrate that CO2, CO, and CH4 generally increase with orbital distance, and that planets near the outer edge of the habitable zone may undergo CO runaway--a photochemical instability driven by severe depletion of OH radicals. The threshold for CO runaway depends strongly on stellar spectral type and is most easily triggered around cooler, lower-mass stars. In contrast, the atmospheric production of formaldehyde (H2CO)--a key precursor for prebiotic organic chemistry--peaks around planets orbiting more massive, UV-luminous stars and is maximized at orbital distances just interior to the CO-runaway threshold. These results establish a quantitative framework linking observable system properties--stellar type and orbital distance--and the atmospheric carbon chemistry of lifeless Earth-like planets, providing new context for interpreting future spectroscopic observations and for evaluating the potential of such planets to sustain prebiotic chemistry.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05313v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Available one-dimensional stellar models fail to reproduce the observed spectrum of the ultracool M dwarf TRAPPIST-1. In particular, current models predict strong iron hydride (FeH) absorption due to the Wing-Ford bands at 0.99$\mu$m, yet this spectral feature is only weakly present in TRAPPIST-1 and other mid-to-late M dwarf stars. Additionally, the shape of the continuum between the water bands in the near-infrared does not match between models and observations. Here, we show that assumptions about pressure broadening, specifically van der Waals broadening, have a dramatic effect on modeled broadband spectral features. We use Merged Parallelized Simplified-ATLAS to generate synthetic spectra over a range of van der Waals broadening strengths, adopting 1D PHOENIX temperature-pressure structures. We find that minimal broadening best matches the observed FeH profile at 0.99$\mu$m and in the pseudocontinuum between the large water bands. These results suggest that broadening prescriptions derived for Sun-like stars are not valid for lower-mass stars and that pressure broadening for molecular lines in cool stellar atmospheres must be reevaluated. Refining pressure broadening treatments will improve the accuracy of M dwarf spectral models, enabling more reliable determinations of stellar properties and atmospheric compositions of planets orbiting M dwarfs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.10060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant shift in astrochemistry with a renewed focus on the role of non-thermal processes on the molecular interstellar medium, in particular energetic particles (such as cosmic ray particles and fast electrons) and X-ray radiation. This has been brought about in large part due to new observations of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMS) in environments that would inhibit their formation, such as cold, dense gas in prestellar cores or in the highly energetic environments in galactic centers. In parallel, there has been a plethora of new laboratory investigations on the role of high-energy radiation and electrons on the chemistry of astrophysical ices, demonstrating the ability of this radiation to induce complex chemistry. In recent years, theoretical models have also begun to include newer cosmic-ray-driven processes in both the gas and ice phases. In this review, we unify aspects of the chemistry driven by X-ray radiation and energetic particles into a ``high-energy astrochemistry&#x27;&#x27;, defining this term and reviewing the underlying chemical processes. We conclude by examining various laboratories where high-energy astrochemistry is at play and identify future issues to be tackled.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05389v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We examine the differences between the driven turbulence described by the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation and the second law of thermodynamics. A general velocity and entropy density system is analyzed with the unified thermodynamic algorithm of metriplectic dynamics, and we show that the positive spectra of the KS equation due to an external energy source prevent its metriplectic description. A variant of the KS equation is produced that monotonically generates an entropy, but the only equilibria of this variant system are spatially constant. Numerical experiments are performed comparing the evolution of the KS equation and its thermodynamic variant. The entropy of this thermodynamic system is increased further by the driving effects of the KS equation, reconciling the generation of entropy with the energy source of the KS equation. Further numerical experiments restrict the positive spectra in the KS equation to determine the effect on the system time evolution. While rescaling the growth rates of instabilities reproduces similar behavior on a slower time scale, introduction of individual positive spectra reproduces the formation of equilibria, relative equilibria, and a transition to chaos.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05932v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Binaries occur in many astrophysical systems, from young protostellar binaries in star forming regions to supermassive black hole binaries in galaxy centers. In many cases, a circumbinary disk of gas forms around the binary with an orbit that may be misaligned to the binary plane. Misaligned disks around nearly circular binaries evolve into disks that are either aligned or counteraligned with the binary orbit. However, if the binary is sufficiently eccentric, then it can be more likely that the disk ends up in a polar-aligned configuration in which the disk angular momentum vector aligns with the binary eccentricity vector. We use Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations, evolved to an approximate steady state under mass injection, to determine the orbital evolution of a binary with a polar-aligned disk for a range of binary-disk parameters. We find that, in all of the cases we have simulated, the binary shrinks with time. The decay rate is larger than for binaries surrounded by aligned or retrograde disks with matched disk parameters. The rate of shrinkage is largely unaltered by the size of the sink radii employed for the binary stars, but for small enough sink radii some of the models exhibit long-lived polar circumprimary disks, which are continually fed mass from the circumbinary disk. We discuss our results in the contexts of planet formation in young polar-aligned disks and merging supermassive black holes in galaxy centers.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05423v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Standard fractional calculus has successfully modeled systems with power-law memory. However, complex phenomena in heterogeneous media often exhibit multi-scale memory effects and aging properties that classical operators cannot capture. In this work, we construct a unified framework by defining the \textit{Weighted Weyl-Sonine Operators}. This formalism offers a fundamental generalization of fractional calculus, freeing the theory from the constraints of power-law memory (via Sonine kernels), time-translation invariance (via scale and weight functions), and artificial history truncation (via Weyl integration). The main result is a Generalized Spectral Mapping Theorem, proving that the Weighted Fourier Transform acts as a universal diagonalization map for these operators. We rigorously characterize the admissible memory kernels through the class of \textit{Complete Bernstein Functions}, ensuring that the resulting operators preserve the fundamental properties of positivity and monotonicity. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical bridge between the algebraic Sonine definition and the analytical Marchaud representation involving L\&#x27;evy measures. Finally, we apply this theory to solve generalized relaxation equations and \textit{Weighted Distributed Order} evolution problems, demonstrating that phenomena of ultra-slow diffusion and retarded aging can be treated explicitly within this unified spectral framework.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> G-rich repetitive nucleic acid sequences can fold into G-quadruplexes (G4s) upon coordination with potassium ions (K+). Small natural and synthetic molecules (G4 ligands) can bind to and stabilize G4 structures in vitro, thereby interfering with biological processes involving G4-containing genes. Therefore, G4 ligands represent highly valuable tools for unveiling G4 biological functions. Together with non-covalent reversible G4 ligands, reactive compounds capable of forming covalent bonds with G4s upon thermal and photochemical activation represent a new class of promising G4 ligands with the potential to be harnessed for the identification and isolation of G4s from a biological environment. In particular, photoaffinity labelling (PAL) encompasses the potential to obtain spatial and temporal control over the alkylation event. However, to date, only a few examples of covalent G4 ligands for PAL approaches have been described, and very low alkylation yields plague all of them. Herein, the synthesis of new families of photoactivatable G4 ligands functionalized with different warheads (e.g., benzophenones and diazirines) is described, as well as their photoreactivity in the presence of three different G4s: 22AG, cMyc, and 25CEBwt. Among the different compounds, diazirine derivatives displayed the highest G4 selectivity and unprecedented high alkylation yields (up to 70%) together with a remarkable selective N- and O-alkylation reaction only on thymine and guanine nucleobases as identified by using a prototype ligand. These new compounds pave the way for the development of new methodologies, allowing for functional investigation and druggability of G4 in cells.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05976v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We present a rotational velocity (vsini) survey of 32 stellar/substellar objects and giant planets using Keck/KPIC high-resolution spectroscopy, including 6 giant planets (2-7 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) and 25 substellar/stellar companions (12-88 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$). Adding companions with spin measurements from the literature, we construct a curated spin sample for 43 benchmark stellar/substellar companions and giant planets and 54 free-floating brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects. We compare their spins, parameterized as fractional breakup velocities at 10 Myr, assuming constant angular momentum evolution. We find the first clear evidence that giant planets exhibit distinct spins versus low-mass brown dwarf companions (10 to 40 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$) at 4-4.5 $\sigma$ significance assuming inclinations aligned with their orbits, while under randomly oriented inclinations the significance is at 1.6-2.1 $\sigma$. Our findings hold when considering various assumptions about planets, and the mass ratio below 0.8% gives a clean cut for rotation between giant planets and brown dwarf companions. The higher fractional breakup velocities of planets can be interpreted as less angular momentum loss through circumplanetary disk braking during the planet formation phase. Brown dwarf companions exhibit evidence of slower rotation compared to isolated brown dwarfs, while planets and planetary mass objects show similar spins. Finally, our analysis of specific angular momentum versus age of 221 stellar/substellar objects below 0.1 MSun with spin measurements in the literature indicates that the substellar objects of 5-40 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ retain much higher angular momenta compared to stellar and substellar objects of 40-100 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ after 10 Myr, when their initial angular momenta were set.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2407.13154v4 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Planetary systems with multiple transiting planets are beneficial for understanding planet occurrence rates and system architectures. Although we have yet to find a solar system analogue, future surveys may detect multiple terrestrial planets transiting a Sun-like star. In this work, we simulate transit timing observations of our system based on the actual orbital motions of Venus and the Earth+Moon (EM) -- influenced by the other solar system objects -- and retrieve the system&#x27;s dynamical parameters for varying noise levels and observing durations. Using an approximate coplanar N-body model for transit-time variations, we consider test configurations with 2, 3, and 4 planets. For various observing baselines, we can robustly retrieve the masses and orbits of Venus and EM; detect Jupiter at high significance (for &lt; 90-second timing error and baseline $\leq$ 15 yrs); and detect Mars at 5 $\sigma$ confidence (with &lt; 20-second timing error and baseline $\geq$ 27 yrs) using TTVFaster. We also find that the 3-planet model is generally preferred, and provide equations to estimate the mass precision of Venus/Earth/Jupiter-analogues. The addition of Mars -- which is near a 2:1 mean-motion resonance with Earth -- improves our retrieval of Jupiter&#x27;s parameters, suggesting that unseen terrestrials could interfere in the characterization of multi-planetary systems. Our findings are comparable to theoretical limits based upon stellar variability and may eventually be possible.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05758v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Ice nucleation is greatly important in areas as diverse as climate change, cryobiology, geology or food industry. Predicting the ability of a substrate to induce the nucleation of ice from supercooled water is a difficult problem. Here, we use molecular simulations to analyse how the ice nucleating ability is affected by the substrate lattice structure and orientation. We focus on different model lattices: simple cubic, body centred cubic and face centred cubic, and assess their ability to induce ice nucleation by calculating nucleation rates. Several orientations are studied for the case of the face centred cubic lattice. Curiously, a hexagonal symmetry does not guarantee a better ice nucleating ability. By comparing the body centred cubic and the cubic lattices we determined that there is a significant role of the underlying crystal plane(s) on ice nucleation. The structure of the liquid layer adjacent to the substrate reveals that more efficient nucleants induce a more structured liquid. The most efficient substrates present a strong sensitivity of their ice nucleating ability to the lattice parameters. Introducing a novel methodological approach, we use Classical Nucleation Theory to estimate the contact angle of the ice nucleus on the studied substrates from the calculated nucleation rates. The method also provides the nucleation free energy barrier height, the kinetic pre-factor and the critical cluster size. The latter is in agreement with the nucleus size obtained through a microscopic analysis of the nucleation trajectories, which supports the validity of Classical Nucleation Theory down to small critical clusters.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2507.11300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) chalcogenides are stable, non-toxic candidates for optoelectronic or thermoelectric applications. The structural diversity of RP oxides is already exploited to tune properties or achieve more advanced functionalities like multiferroicity, however, little is known about the structural evolution of RP chalcogenides. In this work, we develop a high-accuracy machine-learned interatomic potential to run large-scale molecular dynamics simulations on $Ba_{n+1}Zr_nS_{3n+1}$ for $n=1$ to $n=6$. We predict new polymorphs for each $n$-value, calculate their corresponding phase transition temperatures, and validate our approach through comparison to published experimental results. We find that the $n=1$ phase exhibits negative thermal expansion, that $n=1$ and $n=3$ undergo unusual ascending symmetry breaking, and that phases with $n\geq4$ form layer-dependent tilt patterns previously unreported for inorganic RP materials. This unique behaviour results from competition between octahedral rotations and rumpling at the rocksalt interface, and suggests new strategies for accessing advanced functionalities.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2508.08012v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Complex physical simulations often require trade-offs between model fidelity and computational feasibility. We introduce Adaptive Online Emulation (AOE), which dynamically learns neural network surrogates during simulation execution to accelerate expensive components. Unlike existing methods requiring extensive offline training, AOE uses Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machines (OS-ELMs) to continuously adapt emulators along the actual simulation trajectory. We employ a numerically stable variant of the OS-ELM using cumulative sufficient statistics to avoid matrix inversion instabilities. AOE integrates with time-stepping frameworks through a three-phase strategy balancing data collection, updates, and surrogate usage, while requiring orders of magnitude less training data than conventional surrogate approaches. Demonstrated on a 1D atmospheric model of exoplanet GJ1214b, AOE achieves 11.1 times speedup (91% time reduction) across 200,000 timesteps while maintaining accuracy, potentially making previously intractable high-fidelity time-stepping simulations computationally feasible.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05792v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Accurate drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is essential for computational drug discovery, yet existing models often rely on single-modality predefined molecular descriptors or sequence-based embeddings with limited representativeness. We propose Tensor-DTI, a contrastive learning framework that integrates multimodal embeddings from molecular graphs, protein language models, and binding-site predictions to improve interaction modeling. Tensor-DTI employs a siamese dual-encoder architecture, enabling it to capture both chemical and structural interaction features while distinguishing interacting from non-interacting pairs. Evaluations on multiple DTI benchmarks demonstrate that Tensor-DTI outperforms existing sequence-based and graph-based models. We also conduct large-scale inference experiments on CDK2 across billion-scale chemical libraries, where Tensor-DTI produces chemically plausible hit distributions even when CDK2 is withheld from training. In enrichment studies against Glide docking and Boltz-2 co-folder, Tensor-DTI remains competitive on CDK2 and improves the screening budget required to recover moderate fractions of high-affinity ligands on out-of-family targets under strict family-holdout splits. Additionally, we explore its applicability to protein-RNA and peptide-protein interactions. Our findings highlight the benefits of integrating multimodal information with contrastive objectives to enhance interaction-prediction accuracy and to provide more interpretable and reliability-aware models for virtual screening.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05891v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The splitting of the principal peak in the structure factor of liquid water is commonly interpreted as evidence of a competition between two distinct local environments. Here, we show that this peak splitting arises from medium-range topological features of the hydrogen-bond network. Using atomistic simulations, we systematically decompose the structure factor into contributions from hydrogen-bonded rings of different sizes. We find that 5-8-membered rings, which dominate the network topology of liquid water at low temperatures, can directly explain the experimentally observed bimodal scattering signal. Among these, 5-membered rings are particularly persistent, maintaining distinct structural signatures even above room temperature. Our findings establish a direct link between the network topology of liquid water and experimentally accessible diffraction features, clarifying the microscopic basis of water&#x27;s behaviour and suggesting a broader conceptual framework for interpreting the anomalies in tetrahedral network liquids and glasses.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> G-rich repetitive nucleic acid sequences can fold into G-quadruplexes (G4s) upon coordination with potassium ions (K+). Small natural and synthetic molecules (G4 ligands) can bind to and stabilize G4 structures in vitro, thereby interfering with biological processes involving G4-containing genes. Therefore, G4 ligands represent highly valuable tools for unveiling G4 biological functions. Together with non-covalent reversible G4 ligands, reactive compounds capable of forming covalent bonds with G4s upon thermal and photochemical activation represent a new class of promising G4 ligands with the potential to be harnessed for the identification and isolation of G4s from a biological environment. In particular, photoaffinity labelling (PAL) encompasses the potential to obtain spatial and temporal control over the alkylation event. However, to date, only a few examples of covalent G4 ligands for PAL approaches have been described, and very low alkylation yields plague all of them. Herein, the synthesis of new families of photoactivatable G4 ligands functionalized with different warheads (e.g., benzophenones and diazirines) is described, as well as their photoreactivity in the presence of three different G4s: 22AG, cMyc, and 25CEBwt. Among the different compounds, diazirine derivatives displayed the highest G4 selectivity and unprecedented high alkylation yields (up to 70%) together with a remarkable selective N- and O-alkylation reaction only on thymine and guanine nucleobases as identified by using a prototype ligand. These new compounds pave the way for the development of new methodologies, allowing for functional investigation and druggability of G4 in cells.</p>
