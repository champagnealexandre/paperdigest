<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nipah virus (NiV) represents a catastrophic public health risk to the Indian subcontinent, as evidenced by recurring outbreaks in Kerala (2018, 2021, 2023) where case fatality rates reached as high as 70-90%. There are currently no clinically approved therapeutics or vaccines specifically for NiV. A major hurdle in the drug development pipeline is the high mutation rate of RNA viruses, which allows them to rapidly evolve resistance against site-specific inhibitors. This research project utilizes a multi-layered computational strategy to identify a small-molecule inhibitor capable of targeting the viral polymerase while maintaining efficacy against the predicted high-probability W730A resistance mutation. Through a first-principles assessment of the viral polymerase structure (PDB: 9KNZ), I established a design constraint called Allosteric Independence. This requires any lead candidate to bind in a pocket that is geometrically distinct from the mutation site W730, thereby preventing steric or electronic disruption upon mutation. After screening a library of 50 high-potential candidates using a rigid-receptor docking protocol, I identified BMS-986205 (Linrodostat), an investigational IDO1 inhibitor, as a superior lead. BMS-986205 demonstrated a binding affinity of -7.17 kcal/mol against the wild-type polymerase and a paradoxical increase to -7.29 kcal/mol against the W730A mutant. Geometric analysis confirmed a physical separation of 6.28 Å from the mutation site. Given its current status in global Phase 3 clinical trials for oncology, BMS-986205 is a primary candidate for rapid drug repurposing to secure India’s population against future outbreaks.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces an integer-grid coordinate scheme (MINT32) that greatly reduces energy drift and improves long-timescale stability in GPU molecular dynamics, a broadly enabling advance for high-precision simulations (including water and biomolecular systems) but not directly focused on origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Molecular dynamics simulations on GPUs have historically required a trade-off between performance and numerical precision. Mixed-precision approaches, such as AMBER SPFP and OpenMM, accumulate forces in high precision while representing coordinates in single precision (FP32). This design introduces a fundamental “noise floor”: quantization error in FP32 coordinates injects artificial heat into the system, degrading long-term stability and distorting kinetic properties. We introduce MINT32, a coordinate representation that maps the simulation box onto a 32-bit integer grid. MINT32 achieves a spatial resolution of approximately 0.01 fm, roughly 300 times finer than FP32, without the memory bandwidth penalties associated with 64-bit integer arithmetic. In addition, MINT32 offers algorithmic elegance through self-wrapping, whereby periodic boundary conditions are enforced via exact integer overflow, eliminating branch divergence entirely. Benchmark results demonstrate that MINT32 reduces energy drift in microcanonical (NVE) simulations by nearly an order of magnitude (7--10x), delivering double-precision-level stability for challenging PME water systems. When paired with single-precision force evaluations, MINT32 outperforms conventional mixed-precision models, indicating that coordinate precision is the dominant factor governing simulation stability in the systems examined. The fixed-point grid further enables constraint solvers (SHAKE) to converge to tolerances of 10A, effectively eliminating constraint instabilities. Our implementation achieves approximately 85\% of production throughput on consumer-grade GPUs, serving as a conceptual foundation for future molecular dynamics (MD) engines. The primary objective of this study is to identify an optimal coordinate representation for next-generation MD software. To this end, we present a prototype framework designed to isolate and evaluate the numerical behavior of coordinate representations in molecular dynamics, with a modified version of the AMBER simulation package serving solely as a testbed.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Selective synthetic routes to prepare boronic esters are highly desirable as they are valuable intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional materials. In this paper, we report a new approach to generate boronic esters through the ring-opening hydroboration of benzylidene cyclobutanes catalysed by magnesium(II) complexes. For the first time, products were accessed through the selective hydroboration of a single C–C sigma-bond of the cyclobutane ring with complete chemoselectivity and high E:Z selectivities (99:1 to 3:1) across a wide range of substrates. The mechanism is proposed to proceed through the hydromagnesiation of the benzylidene cyclobutane, ring-opening by beta-alkyl migration, and subsequent Mg-to-B metathesis. Probe experiments, 11B NMR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations suggest that boronate complexes play a role in catalytic turnover, and that ring-closed hydroborated species form as off-cycle intermediates. The new process represents an important example in which a sustainable and inexpensive magnesium catalyst performs in an entirely complementary manner to transition metal systems.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The increasing importance and predictive power of modern molecular modeling, driven by physics- and machine learning-based methods, necessitates a new collaborative architecture to replace the isolated, traditional model of software development. The traditional approach often led to redundant engineering effort, high costs, and opaque systems that limit reproducibility, independent scrutiny, and scientific independence. This perspective advocates for permissively licensed open source software as a scientific and economic multiplier by reducing the duplication of effort, enabling scientific validation of modeling tools, and frictionless experimentation with new ideas. Coordinated, multi-project consortia, such as Open Force Field, Open Free Energy, OpenFold, and OpenADMET have formed to collaboratively build shared computational infrastructure and release all methods under permissive licenses. The success of these large-scale efforts requires organizational structures that extend beyond code. The Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF), a US nonprofit, serves as a domain-specific institutional home and fiscal sponsor. By providing governance, administrative infrastructure, and dedicated research software engineers, OMSF aligns incentives across academic and industrial stakeholders. This framework enables a synergistic ecosystem where projects interoperate to accelerate innovation, eliminate duplication, and ensure long-term software sustainability, thereby creating durable foundations that elevate the entire molecular modeling community.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Vitrimers are the new class of covalent adaptable networks (CANs) capable of topological rearrangement through dynamic bond exchange, enabling recyclability, self-healing and stress relaxation while maintaining network integrity. The ring opening of epoxides by carboxylic acids is a fundamental epoxy–acid esterification reaction underlying vitrimer network formation, yet its atomistic mechanism remains challenging to simulate as experimental time scales for crosslinking reactions in polymers range from minutes to hours—far beyond the reach of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this work, we employ biased MD using the Collective Variables (COLVARS) module in LAMMPS combined with a reactive ReaxFF potential to promote the ring-opening reaction between Diglycidyl Ether of Bisphenol A (DGEBA) and oxalic acid. Three coupled collective variables were designed to represent epoxide C–O bond cleavage, C(epoxide)–O(acid) bond formation, and proton transfer between acid and epoxide oxygens. This external bias promotes nucleophilic addition of acid-derivedcarboxylate oxygen to the epoxide carbon, resulting in ring opening, followed by proton transfer to yield the β-hydroxy ester functionality characteristic of vitrimer networks. This method allows simulating cross-linking at realistic, low, temperatures which helps to mimic chemical reactions and avoids unwanted high-temperature side reactions. Since not all accelerated events lead to the desired product, careful selection of initial configurations, molecular orientations, and suitable external bias parameters increases the probability of meaningful simulation results. Furthermore, the stability of the resulting vitrimer was evaluated in the absence of any external bias, and its thermomechanical properties were subsequently analyzed. Results show that the biased MD approach successfully captures the atomistic steps of the esterification reaction and the resulting vitrimer network can be used for accurate prediction of thermomechanical properties.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are a versatile family of porous materials whose modular architecture enables tunable structural diversity and functional versatility. biological MOFs extend this concept by incorporating biomolecules as linkers, introducing biocompatibility and catalytic functionality. Here we performed the in situ construction of MOF elements through the direct involvement of enzymes during framework formation. In the absence of enzymes, Ni–MOFs exhibited a typical compact, closed morphology, whereas enzyme-assisted synthesis produced well-defined microsnowflake-like structures. The formation process was rapid, and extended synthesis times did not induce changes in the final morphology. Notably, the enzyme structure played a key role in determining the final architecture; the use of larger enzymes, such as catalase, resulted in the formation of a sandwich-like layered structure. Structural characterization confirmed the formation of a porous material with an average pore size of revealing an average pore diameter ranging from 3 to 6 nm and pore volumes between 0.17 and 0.22 cm³/g . Also Ni-ELFs hybrid showed surface area from 82 of m²/g to 139 m²/g (for Ni-ELF 1). Fluorescent labeling of the protein allowed the localization of the enzyme within the flake-like structures, revealing its preferential distribution at the periphery while leaving the central region accessible, thereby generating a novel hierarchical hybrid porous material. To evaluate catalytic efficiency, ELFs were tested in hydrolytic reactions as esterase/lipase-mimic catalysts. In this context, Ni-based ELFs outperformed free lipases with ELF-1 exhibiting the highest catalytic activity compared to other ELF hybrids. As a proof of concept for hydrolysis-mimic plastic degradation, ELF-1 demonstrated notable activity in the direct degradation of PET bottle fragments into microstructured products.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Copolymers play a vital role in a diverse array of functional materials, where their properties are determined by both their molecular weight and monomer sequence. While precise molecular weight control has been achieved in anionic polymerization reactions, sequence control remains a major challenge, particularly in fast copolymerization reactions that occur on the millisecond (ms) timescale. This limitation arises because conventional in situ spectroscopic analyses fail to capture such rapid kinetics in polar solvents, and existing quenched-flow setups are too complex for practical use. Here, we report a modular flow- microreactor platform that enables both kinetic analysis and sequence control in a fast, living anionic copolymerization reaction. By exploiting ms-scale mixing and quenching, we determined the propagation rate constants for the copolymerization of styrene and tert-butoxystyrene using the Beckingham–Sanoja–Lynd model, providing the first quantitative kinetic insight into such a rapid anionic system. Furthermore, by controlling the monomer feed based on the obtained rate constants, we achieved the synthesis of pseudo-random, gradient, and block copolymers. The pseudo-random copolymer exhibits low glass-transition temperatures and high solubility. This work provides a practical and quantitative approach for analyzing ms-scale polymerization processes and offers a general platform that combines reaction kinetics with polymer-sequence design, thus opening new opportunities for the rational development of functional materials through living anionic polymerization.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Embedding mechanophores into polymer matrices to activate mechanochemical reactions has been extensively employed to realize diverse functional applications. Spiropyran (SP) is a widely used mechanophore that undergoes force-induced isomerization into its activated merocyanine (MC) form, accompanied by a color change. To accurately simulate the SP-MC isomerization process under tension, the present work introduces a large-scale hybrid coarse-grained/atomistic (CG/AA) model in which poly(methyl metacrylate) (PMMA) monomers are represented by in dividual beads, while SP remains fully described at the AA level. We used force field parameters derived from quantum chemical (QC) data, employing the fully atomistic framework previously developed by our group. The underlying CG PMMA force field was reparameterized to match experimental bulk properties and compared with a corresponding atomistic force field. This approach enabled deformation simulations of significantly larger systems than possible with a pure AA force field, at reduced computational cost, thereby providing novel insights into force transduction and mechanophore activation. Furthermore, a parabolic stress distribution was observed along individual PMMA chains, resulting in preferential SP activation near chain centers. Non specific chain scission events occurred far less frequently than SP activations. The developed hybrid model offers a powerful framework for investigating more complex mechanophore doped polymer networks.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The opioid receptor family remains a key target in pain management, yet the discovery of novel scaffolds with favorable CNS penetration and selective μ-opioid activity is limited. Here, we report a tricyclic scaffold inspired by amitriptyline, modified to incorporate opioid pharmacophore features including a phenolic hydroxyl and a tertiary amine side chain. Computational docking of the ligand against the μ-opioid receptor was performed across nine poses, with interactions analyzed using PLIP [4]. The ligand engages a conserved hydrophobic pocket (ILE 245, VAL 249, ILE 271, TRP 242) and forms hydrogen bonds and salt bridges with polar residues (HIS 3, ASP 96, TYR 97/275). Our results suggest that this tricyclic scaffold is compatible with the μ-opioid receptor binding site and may serve as a starting point for further medicinal chemistry optimization.</p>

    <summary>Electrons have internal structure, you cannot have spin without internal structure, you cannot have chemistry without spin, computing with out an explicit model for spin has made chemists’ lives hard.</summary>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Electrons have internal structure, you cannot have spin without internal structure, you cannot have chemistry without spin, computing with out an explicit model for spin has made chemists’ lives hard. We present a deterministic framework for computational chemistry that replaces the probabilistic wave function with a classical electromagnetic model of the electron possessing internal temporal structure. By recognizing the electron as a half-photon electromagnetic field configuration oscillating between two temporal poles separated by δ0 = λC /2 ≈1.21 pm, we resolve the classical radiation catastrophe and recover atomic stability without quan- tum axioms. The electron’s energy resides entirely in the half-photon field oscillation at frequency ω0 = mec2/ℏ, not in electrostatic self-energy of the temporal poles. Angular mo- mentum conservation (L= ℏ) makes the electron stiff against stretching but compressible under strong nuclear fields, with compression energy E(δ) = ℏc/δ increasing hyperbolically as δ &lt; δ0. This temporal structure naturally regularizes the nuclear Coulomb potential, predicting the hydrogen ground state to 0.18% accuracy. The exchange interaction emerges as magnetic phase-locking between antiparallel electron pairs, calibrated from Cooper pair coherence lengths in superconductors. This mechanism reproduces the lithium ionization energy (0.8% error) and derives nitrogen’s sp3 geometry from magnetic dipole packing con- straints. The Pauli exclusion principle arises from two physical mechanisms: (1) compressed electrons cannot phase-lock with uncompressed electrons due to frequency mismatch, and (2) half-photon analytic paths resist spatial overlap. The model offers O(N2) computational scaling for molecular systems, presenting a classical alternative to density functional theory.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Amid the alarming threat of pollution, the electrocatalytic pathway stands out as a frontrunner, offering a promising strategy for clean energy conversion and environmental remediation. However, despite its immense potential, the practical substitution of the industrial process remains an elusive target. Despite conducting considerable research for over a century, the primary problem remains the engineering of an efficient and durable electrocatalyst to overcome bottlenecks and convert electrochemical pathways into viable, scalable technologies. Herein, this work transcends a comprehensive review by bridging material breakthroughs with their fundamental mechanistic insights and, through a meticulous analysis of existing experimental studies, reveals how either a small magnetic field or a fictitious magnetic field orchestrates complex catalytic pathways, positioning itself as a cornerstone work to propel the future of magneto-electrochemistry. The material aspects cover not only the already tested materials but also draw a new roadmap for advanced quantum materials that can change the landscape of spin-based catalysis research. Ultimately, the integration of complex materials with dynamic mechanistic understanding, rational cell engineering across diverse applications, and AI- and ML-driven predictive design is poised to revolutionize magnetic-field-assisted catalysis. This unified and adaptive framework for magneto-electrocatalysis not only delineates existing challenges but also illuminates sustainable and scalable pathways toward next-generation energy conversion, environmental remediation, and green chemical manufacturing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Selective synthetic routes to prepare boronic esters are highly desirable as they are valuable intermediates in the preparation of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and functional materials. In this paper, we report a new approach to generate boronic esters through the ring-opening hydroboration of benzylidene cyclobutanes catalysed by magnesium(II) complexes. For the first time, products were accessed through the selective hydroboration of a single C–C sigma-bond of the cyclobutane ring with complete chemoselectivity and high E:Z selectivities (99:1 to 3:1) across a wide range of substrates. The mechanism is proposed to proceed through the hydromagnesiation of the benzylidene cyclobutane, ring-opening by beta-alkyl migration, and subsequent Mg-to-B metathesis. Probe experiments, 11B NMR spectroscopy, and DFT calculations suggest that boronate complexes play a role in catalytic turnover, and that ring-closed hydroborated species form as off-cycle intermediates. The new process represents an important example in which a sustainable and inexpensive magnesium catalyst performs in an entirely complementary manner to transition metal systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chiral non-benzenoid nanographenes remain highly appealing but underexplored synthetic targets due to the lack of feasible synthetic strategies to simultaneously construct non-hexagonal rings and stable chirality. Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of a novel chiral saddle-shaped nanographene (cSNG) incorporating two heptagon-embedded [4]helicenes. The structure of cSNG is unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, demonstrating its flexible π-skeleton. Due to the heptagon-embedded [4]helicene subunits, cSNG exists as configurationally stable enantiomers, which enable chiral resolution and lead to pronounced chiroptical responses. Remarkably, the chiral saddle-shaped framework presents strong host–guest interactions with fullerenes C60 and C70, which were investigated via several titration methods. The association constants for a 1:1 complex, determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy titration (Ka(C60) = 2.3 × 104 M-1; Ka(C70) = 8.7 × 104 M-1), are among the highest values reported for negatively curved nanographenes. Moreover, crystallographic analysis of cocrystals of cSNG with C60 revealed a 1:3 binding mode for supramolecular complexation, featuring two fullerenes accommodated inside the saddle cavity as well as two shared fullerenes located on each concave outward facing side.</p>

When incorporated into polymeric networks, they form DES-based gels—hybrid semi-solid systems that merge the structural integrity of gels with the functional advantages of DES. These materials demonstrate exceptional potential in pharmaceutical sciences by offering improved solubility for poorly soluble drugs, enhanced dermal and mucosal permeation, greater chemical and thermal stability, and more controlled drug-release behaviour compared to conventional hydrogels. Recent advances reveal their promising utility across diverse applications, including topical formulations, wound healing, enzyme stabilisation, nanomedicine, and buccal mucoadhesive delivery. This mini-review summarises the composition, structural features, and mechanisms of action, and therapeutic advantages of DES-gels, while also outlining key challenges and future research opportunities necessary for their translation into safe and clinically relevant systems.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The development of molecular post-modification design strategies that enable low-temperature pyrolysis of polystyrene (PS) remains an underexplored area. The current state of the art for the pyrolysis of PS demands heating above 400°C which creates economic barriers to commercial-scale monomer recovery. Here, we demonstrate the post-functionalization of the PS backbone with a labile C-S bond, specifically a trifluoromethylthio group (SCF3), to accelerate the depolymerization of PS at lower temperatures. We first adapted the trifluoromethylthiolation reaction to PS which involved solvent screening and reaction optimization. We observed a significant increase in the depolymerization of PS-SCF3 compared to PS across a wide range of molecular weights and consumer-grade products at 300°C. Using the Flynn-Ozawa-Wall analysis, the average apparent activation energy for the depolymerization of PS-SCF3 is ~11kJ/mol lower than pristine PS. To benchmark this protocol, we found that the pyrolysis of several consumer-grade PS-SCF3 samples at 300°C offered greater amounts of styrene compared to pristine consumer-grade PS. This study explores the possibilities of post-functionalizing the backbone of PS to depolymerize PS at faster timescales and lower temperatures to afford greater recovery of styrene, contributing towards a circular economy of plastics.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Proposes a genome-wide, DNA-template–guided model in which transposable-element–derived initiator loci scaffold transcription factor–mediated protein dimer pools that seed hierarchical assembly of endogenous multiprotein complexes, with implications for cellular organization rather than core origins-of-life chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Molecular mechanisms governing initiation steps of the assembly of thousands of endogenous multi-protein complexes (EMCs) remain incompletely understood. Here, multiple lines of observations are reported reflecting the biological functions-aligned initiation sequence of hybrid assembly pathways (HAPs) of EMCs. HAPs postulate the creation of cell type-specific intracellular pools of hetero- and homodimers as the first step of chain reactions of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of EMCs’ assemblies. The consensus action sequence of HAPs consists of: a) Initiation on genomic DNA templates of the formation of metastable hetero- and homodimers of EMCs’ protein constituents; b) Release of dimers from DNA templates for delivery to the EMCs assembly compartments; c) Assembly of defined EMCs by sequential on demand addition to preformed dimers serving as attractors of EMC-specific monomers’ ensembles. Chromosome-naïve scaffolds of PPIs contributing to creation of intracellular dimer pools constitute genome-wide networks of binding sites for 716 transcription factors (TFs), 534 of which manifest patterns of significantly enriched expression in 1358 brain regions. The initiators’ loci of HAPs appear to operate within nucleosome-depleted islands of transposable elements (TE) – derived sequences within transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. Performance of PPI DNA template-guided assembly lines of EMCs is illustrated in two concurrent modes of PPI cascades: TF-TF PPI chains and TF-PPI Hub protein chains. Regardless of the number of DNA-bound TFs initiating the multistep PPI sequences at PPI initiators (ranging from one to 716 TFs), both modes of operations reached the equilibrium at the PPI constituents saturation levels of ~245 proteins for TF-TF PPI and of ~351 proteins for TF-PPI Hub Proteins’ assembly chains. Regardless of TF panels bound at HAP initiators, proteins of PPI-guided ensembles are enriched in either defined sets of neuroanatomical structures (TF-TF PPI path) or among structural-functional constituents of synapses (PPI Hub proteins path). Examples of default operation modes of DNA-template-guided assemblies of hetero- and homodimers of Yamanaka factors, neurogenesis constituents, and principal protein components of postsynaptic density of excitatory and inhibitory synaptogenesis are reported. Altogether, this contribution reports the foundational evidence for further experimental and theoretical explorations of retrotransposon-seeded genome-wide codes for initiators of PPI chain reactions of protein dimerization creating pools of attractors to guide and accelerate the EMC assemblies.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This ChemRxiv study quantifies how monodisperse PEG chain length controls aqueous solubility (validated by experiments and MD free-energy calculations), offering general solvation/partitioning insights but limited direct relevance to prebiotic chemistry or origins-of-life mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a nonionic and highly water-soluble polymer, and PEGylation is widely used as a versatile chemical strategy to enhance the water solubility of otherwise poorly soluble molecules. The rational design of PEG-appended materials, therefore, requires an estimation of the PEG chain length necessary to achieve the desired level of solubility. Here, we investigated the relationship between the PEG chain length and the water solubility of PEG-appended molecules using a combination of experimental and computational approaches. We focused on monodisperse PEG with a discrete molecular weight, which enables us to identify the relationship between chain length and physicochemical properties, as represented by water solubility. Then, we designed a series of PEG‑appended molecules bearing monodisperse PEG chains of varying lengths, and measured their water solubilities experimentally. In parallel, molecular dynamics-based alchemical free‑energy calculations yielded thermodynamic trends that reproduced the observed dependence of solubility on PEG chain length. Comparison of experimental and computational results showed that the calculations not only distinguished between water-soluble and insoluble PEG-appended molecules but also captured the solubility trends for moderately soluble species. These findings demonstrate the potential of molecular-dynamics-based free-energy calculations for a priori prediction of the water solubility of PEG-appended molecules.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> G-quadruplex (G4) structures within oncogene promoters represent promising therapeutic targets, particularly in the context of transcriptional regulation. Here, we report that the Red box, a fully organic macrocyclic cationic receptor, exhibits high-affinity and selectivity for G4 structures. Biophysical analyses reveal that the Red box binds the c-MYC G4 with nanomolar affinity, stronger than most reported c-MYC ligands. Notably, the Red box displays greater selectivity for c-MYC over duplex DNA compared to the well-characterized porphyrin TMPyP4 and its macrocyclic architecture is essential for this activity, as its acyclic analogue displays negligible G4 stabilization. In cellular assays, treatment with non-cytotoxic concentrations of the Red box selectively downregulated c-MYC expression in HEK293T cells, with minimal effects on c-KIT and hTERT. Furthermore, c-MYC suppression was proportional to its basal expression across several cell lines, supporting a G4-mediated mechanism.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> All-inorganic halide perovskites, especially CsPbBr3 microcrystals, are often considered to be optically stable and less defect-prone compared to their organometallic counterparts. Nevertheless, reports of photoluminescence (PL) blinking in bulk perovskite systems till date are restricted to organometallic halide perovskite nano-/microrods, leaving it an open question whether similar intermittency behaviour can be observed in all-inorganic halide perovskites of comparable dimensions. Intriguingly, we witnessed multi-level PL fluctuations (flickering) in individual green-emitting CsPbBr3 microrods. Wide-field PL microscopy reveals that the intensity fluctuations are nearly identical along the microrod, owing to charge carrier migration, and waveguide‑assisted propagation. Our measurements on single microrod suggests that the flickering dynamics is strongly influenced by excitation power, excitation energy, and local environmental constituents. Under dry argon environment, a sharp reduction in the PL intensity is observed, indicating the formation of large number of nonradiative (NR) centers which quenches all the photogenerated carriers, suppressing overall emission intensity and PL flickering. The exposure of oxygen passivates these NR traps generated under argon, while humidity introduces metastable photoinduced NR traps (“special quenchers”) that govern the enhanced flickering behaviours. Our findings establish that spatiotemporally correlated intermittency is not limited to organometallic perovskites but extends to all-inorganic perovskite bulk emitters as well and provides new insights into the role of transient defects and atmospheric constituents in dictating emission stability.</p>

In this study, we resolve the sub nucleolar structures using expansion microscopy to reveal ordered structures of fibrillar center (FC) and dense fibrillar component (DFC) domains as nested shells, which is reorganized upon cellular stress like DNA damage or RNA polymerase I (RNAPI) inhibition. Direct visualization of nascent (5&#x27; ETS) and mature (28S) rRNA suggested that rRNA synthesis is the critical regulator of nucleolar size, and organization. Nucleolar reorganization upon stress emerges to be a direct function of nascent rRNA levels. Stress-induced transcription inhibition remodels the sub-nucleolar compartments from a viscoelastic state into solid-like condensates thereby perturbing the nucleolar pH gradient due to the missing rRNA scaffold. We show, that rather than signalling to mediate rDNA repair, nucleolar reorganization naturally arises primarily from reduced rRNA levels and the resultant biophysical restructuring of the nucleolus under cellular stress.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Unraveling the kinetics of transcriptional regulation is a central challenge in molecular biology. Traditional inference methods based on cell-to-cell mRNA variability are limited because mRNA levels reflect not only transcriptional activity but also post-transcriptional processes. Recent advances in quantifying nascent RNAs across isogenic cells provide a more direct readout of transcriptional dynamics. Here, we present a moments-based theoretical framework that leverages nascent RNA data to infer transcriptional kinetics. We derive closed-form expressions for the first two time-dependent moments of nascent RNA across three canonical transcription models and demonstrate that nascent RNA exhibits distinct transient overshoots and higher Fano factors compared to mature mRNA. Through analysis of synthetic datasets, we show that these features enable more accurate estimation of transcriptional kinetics and allow reliable model selection, distinguishing single from multi-pathway promoter activation with over 75% accuracy even from small sample sizes. We further validated our model selection method using real experimental transcription datasets in yeast and E. coli cells, with nascent RNA demonstrating superior performance in identifying cross-talk pathway regulation. Our framework thus offers a computationally efficient and mechanistically informative approach for decoding transcriptional dynamics, emphasizing the advantages of time-dependent nascent RNA measurements over mature mRNA in capturing the true kinetics of transcriptional regulation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Antarctic icefish are famous for living without red blood cells, but they are not alone. A species of needle-shaped, warm-water fish called the Asian noodlefish also lacks hemoglobin and red blood cells. Like icefish, its veins are filled with translucent white blood, said H. William Detrich, professor emeritus of marine and environmental sciences, who collaborated with Chinese scientists on a paper about the strange aquatic creatures published in Current Biology.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Therapeutic peptides combine the advantages of small molecules and antibodies, offering target flexibility and low immunogenicity, yet their successful translation requires careful evaluation of multiple developability properties beyond binding alone. As chemically modified peptides become increasingly common in drug design, no unified platform currently supports systematic property assessment across both canonical sequences and SMILES-based representations. Leveraging the generalizability of large foundational models trained on protein and chemical data, we introduce PeptiVerse, a universal therapeutic peptide property prediction platform. PeptiVerse accepts either amino acid sequences or chemically modified peptide SMILES, delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse property prediction tasks, and provides both a web interface and open-source implementation for rapid, accessible, and scalable peptide developability analysis. By unifying property prediction across representations, PeptiVerse directly supports early-stage peptide therapeutic development campaigns and property-aware generative design workflows.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> TMEM16A is a Ca2+-activated anion channel that provides direct electrical feedback to the plasma membrane in response to intracellular Ca2+. Its conductive state remains unresolved, leaving questions about gating, Cl- permeation, and modulation by Ca2+, depolarization, and lipids. To investigate the open state, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of TMEM16A bound to the putative open-state blocker 1PBC. After inhibitor removal, the putative, pore-lining helix TM4 developed kinks at two sites: an upper site that opens the pore for Cl- permeation, and a deeper site causing constriction. A conserved hydrophobic network between TM3 and TM4 persisted in most open structures but separated during extreme dilation, allowing lipids to transiently block the pore. Patch-clamp recordings indicated that the intact network promotes activation. Further simulations yielded &gt; 60 Cl- permeation events and a single-channel conductance matching experiments. Additional electrostatic and kinetic modeling indicated that TMEM16As transition from outward-rectification to Ohmic conductance with increasing Ca2+ results from a weak voltage dependence of Ca2+ binding, which act cooperatively to open the pore.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Although biological membranes exhibit complex and dynamic organization, the mechanistic role of molecular crowding in governing lateral membrane heterogeneity remains poorly characterized experimentally. Here, we provide direct experimental visualization showing that crowding-induced condensation of membrane-anchored macromolecules above the bilayer interface reorganizes membrane dynamics and gives rise to spatially heterogeneous lipid mobility. Both PEGylated lipids and membrane-anchored proteins undergo surface-density-driven condensation on supported lipid bilayers, forming immobile regions that constrain lipid diffusion. Notably, the condensation threshold varies inversely with PEG chain length and surface density, defining a quantitative relationship between molecular size and crowding strength. To directly visualize these crowding-induced structures, we employed nanodelivery using lipid-loaded nanodiscs, revealing a clear correspondence between condensed crowder regions and diffusion barriers reminiscent of the picket-fence model of live-cell membranes. Similar condensation behavior observed for protein-crowded SLBs demonstrates the generality of this crowding-driven mechanism. Together, these findings establish surface-density-driven crowding and condensation of membrane-anchored macromolecules as a key physical mechanism underlying lateral membrane inhomogeneity and position nanodelivery as a general approach for interrogating membrane organization across synthetic and biological systems.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many cheminformatics workflows use Tanimoto similarity between binary fingerprints. When count fingerprints may be more appropriate, the benefit is often not large enough to justify replacing existing clustering tools, database search components, and other often highly optimized binary methods. This paper proposes a novel method based on random superimposed coding to convert count fingerprints to binary fingerprints such that the binary Tanimoto similarity between two binary fingerprints better approximates the multiset Tanimoto similarity between their original count form. In particular, the k-recall@k score for -nearest neighbor search is consistently better than hash-based folding or RDKit&#x27;s count simulation conversion across the four count fingerprint generators in the RDKit, if the number of features is relatively small compared to the binary fingerprint size. For example, with 2048-bit Morgan fingerprints of radius 3, the recall at for folded, count simulation, and superimposed coding are approximately 0.80, 0.86, and 0.94, respectively.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Hidden Subgroup Problem (HSP) unifies several landmark quantum algorithms, yet systematic exploration of its variants and modern applications has slowed. This paper revives HSP-based algorithm design by examining new group structures with direct relevance to post-quantum cryptography, lattice problems, and structured optimization. We classify a family of finite and continuous groups-extensions and semi-direct products of abelian groups, matrix groups, and certain non-abelian groups-according to their Fourier-theoretic properties and the feasibility of efficient quantum Fourier transforms (QFTs). For each class, we determine whether the HSP admits an efficient quantum algorithm, a subexponential-time quantum algorithm, or appears intractable even quantumly. We construct explicit algorithms for eight new problem families, including structured lattice enumeration, automorphism groups of certain graphs, and algebraic attack primitives appearing in code-based and multivariate cryptosystems. For these, we show superpolynomial quantum speedups over all known classical approaches under standard complexity assumptions. We also discuss how approximate and block-encoded QFTs can be combined with variational post-processing to make some of these HSP algorithms more NISQ-friendly. Our results demonstrate that algebraic-structure-based quantum algorithms remain a rich and underexploited direction with both theoretical depth and potential cryptanalytic and optimization applications.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Genome-scale metabolic network (GSMN) models are rigorously curated, cellular-level representations of metabolism that enable flux-based metabolite fate discovery, metabolic engineering, drug target identification and context-specific multi-omics integration. However, the inherent complexity of model architectures, need for programming skills and limited visualization support restrict their broader applicability. Existing tools focus on visualization and analyses separately, necessitating tool-specific format conversions, offer either topology or flux analyses options exclusively, lack intuitive pathway-specific visualizations, database-integrated model refinement, pathway enrichment and large-scale perturbation analyses. Here, we present NAViFluX (metabolic Network Analysis and Visualization of Flux), a visualization-centric, web browser-based environment that unifies GSMN exploration through native pathway/subsystem map generation using various layouts; interactive refinement through addition of reactions from KEGG/BiGG, amending constraints, pathway merging; and modules for flux computations, topology, functional enrichment. Instead of treating visualization as a post hoc step, NAViFluX performs all actions within network views, enabling users to make decisions directly from visually interpretable subnetworks. Using three Escherichia coli case studies, NAViFluX is shown to characterize nutrient-specific metabolic adaptations, improve metabolic gene essentiality predictions, provide mechanistic insight into synthetic lethality and facilitate the design of an optimized carbon-fixing metabolic state, thereby democratizing GSMNs for biologically meaningful applications.</p>
