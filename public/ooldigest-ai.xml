<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05095v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Epilepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by recurrent unprovoked seizures, affects over 50 million people worldwide, and poses significant risks, including sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Conventional unimodal approaches, primarily reliant on electroencephalography (EEG), face several key challenges, including low SNR, nonstationarity, inter- and intrapatient heterogeneity, portability, and real-time applicability in clinical settings. To address these issues, a comprehensive survey highlights the concept of advanced multimodal learning for epileptic seizure detection and prediction (AMLSDP). The survey presents the evolution of epileptic seizure detection (ESD) and prediction (ESP) technologies across different eras. The survey also explores the core challenges of multimodal and non-EEG-based ESD and ESP. To overcome the key challenges of the multimodal system, the survey introduces the advanced processing strategies for efficient AMLSDP. Furthermore, this survey highlights future directions for researchers and practitioners. We believe this work will advance neurotechnology toward wearable and imaging-based solutions for epilepsy monitoring, serving as a valuable resource for future innovations in this domain.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Condensed-matter physics study on site-resolved probes of resonances and rare-region effects in many-body localization, with no direct connection to origins-of-life, prebiotic chemistry, habitability, or biosignatures.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05177v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We explore the limitations of using imbalance dynamics as a diagnostic tool for many-body localization (MBL) and show that spatial averaging can mask important microscopic features. Focusing on the strongly disordered regime of the random-field XXZ chain, we use state-of-the-art numerical techniques (Krylov time evolution and full diagonalization) to demonstrate that site-resolved spin autocorrelators reveal a rich and complex dynamical behavior that is obscured by the imbalance observable. By analyzing the time evolution and infinite-time limits of these local probes, we reveal resonant structures and rare local instabilities within the MBL phase. These numerical findings are supported by an analytical, few-site toy model that captures the emergence of a multiple-peak structure in local magnetization histograms, which is a hallmark of local resonances. These few-body local effects provide a more detailed understanding of ergodicity-breaking dynamics, and also allow us to explain the finite-size effects of long-time imbalance, and its sensitivity to the initial conditions in quench protocols. Overall, our experimentally testable predictions highlight the necessity of a refined, site-resolved approach to fully understand the complexities of MBL and its connection to rare-region effects.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2510.06154v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The formation of gullies on Mars has often been attributed to the melting of (sub)surface water ice. However, melting-based hypotheses generally overlook key processes: (1) sublimation cooling by latent heat absorption, (2) the non-stability of ice where melting conditions can be reached, and (3) the particular microclimates of gullied slopes. Using state-of-the-art climate simulations, we reassess ice melting scenarios over the past four million years (obliquity &lt;= 35{\deg}), beyond the estimated period of gully formation. We find that the melting of opaque water snow or ice at the surface of Mars is unlikely anywhere due to sublimation cooling, while (quasi-) stable subsurface ice is typically too deep to reach melting temperatures. We propose an alternative mechanism in which seasonal CO2 frost sublimation destabilizes the regolith and brings the underlying water ice close to the surface, allowing rapid heating. Even under these optimal conditions, melting requires unrealistic assumptions. Ice containing a small amount of dust could melt via a solid-state greenhouse effect, but both its possibility and frequency in Mars&#x27; recent past remain uncertain.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04325v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We explore the connection between evolution and large-deviation theory. To do so, we study evolutionary dynamics in which individuals experience mutations, reproduction, and selection using variants of the Moran model. We show that, in the large population size limit, the impact of reproduction and selection amounts to realizing a large-deviation dynamics for the non-interacting random walk in which individuals simply explore the genome landscape due to mutations. This mapping, which holds at all times, allows us to recast transitions in the population genome distribution as dynamical phase transitions, which can then be studied using the toolbox of large-deviation theory. Finally, we show that the mapping extends beyond the class of Moran models.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Tests whether CO2-rich Martian-like atmospheres can replace argon as shielding gas for selective laser melting of 316L steel, supporting in-situ manufacturing on Mars but offering only tangential relevance to origins-of-life astrobiology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04232v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: In-space manufacturing is essential for achieving long-term planetary colonization, particularly on Mars, where material transport from Earth is both costly and logistically restrictive. Traditional subtractive manufacturing methods are highly equipment-, energy-, and material-intensive, making additive manufacturing (AM) a more practical and sustainable alternative for extraterrestrial production. Among various AM technologies, selective laser melting (SLM) stands out due to its exceptional versatility, precision, and capability to produce dense metallic parts with complex geometries. However, conventional SLM processes rely heavily on inert argon environments to prevent oxidation and ensure high-quality part formation, conditions that are difficult to reproduce on Mars. This study investigates the feasibility of using carbon dioxide (CO2), which makes up over 95% of the Martian atmosphere, as a potential substitute for argon in SLM. Single-track and two-dimensional 316L stainless steel specimens were fabricated under argon, CO2, and ambient air environments with a wide range of laser parameters to evaluate the influence of atmospheric composition on surface morphology, microstructural cohesion, and oxidation behavior. The results reveal that no single parameter controls the overall part quality; rather, a balance of parameters is essential to maintain thermal equilibrium during fabrication. Although parts produced in CO2 exhibited slightly inferior surface finish, cohesion, and oxidation resistance compared to argon, they performed significantly better than those fabricated in ambient air. These findings suggest that CO2-assisted SLM could enable sustainable in situ manufacturing on Mars and may also serve as a cost-effective alternative shielding gas for terrestrial applications.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04593v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation is a driving source of photochemistry in planetary atmospheres. Proper interpretation of atmospheric observations requires a full understanding of the radiation environment that a planet is exposed to. Using the Suborbital Imaging Spectrograph for Transition-region Irradiance from Nearby Exoplanet host stars (SISTINE) rocket-borne spectrograph, we observed the Sun-like binary system $\alpha$ Centauri AB and captured the FUV spectrum of both stars simultaneously. Our spectra cover 980--1570 {\AA}, providing the broadest FUV wavelength coverage taken in a single exposure and spanning several key stellar emission features which are important photochemical drivers. Combining the SISTINE spectrum with archival observations, model spectra, and a novel stellar activity model, we have created spectral energy distributions (SEDs) spanning 5 {\AA}--1 mm for both $\alpha$ Centauri A and B. We use the SEDs to estimate the total high-energy flux (X-ray--UV) incident on a hypothetical exoplanet orbiting $\alpha$ Centauri A. Because the incident flux varies over time due to the orbit of the stellar companion and the activity level of each star, we use the VULCAN photochemical kinetics code to estimate atmospheric chemical abundances in the case of minimum and maximum flux exposure. Our results indicate that enhanced atmospheric mass loss due to stellar binarity will likely not be an issue for future exoplanet-hunting missions such as the Habitable Worlds Observatory when searching for Earth-like planets around Sun-like stars.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.01474v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The interactions between stars and their orbiting planets, driven by forces such as stellar radiation and gravity, play an essential role in shaping exoplanetary atmospheres and gas-rich debris discs. One way to look into the composition of these environments is to observe how they can contaminate the stellar photospheres. For that, we examine how stellar radiation pressure and gravity influence atomic species and analyse their effects across various stellar effective temperatures. Using the radiative-to-gravitational force ratio, we determined the atomic movement direction and assessed the velocity boost imparted to neutral atoms escaping from exoplanet atmospheres or debris discs. Incorporating the solar far ultraviolet/extreme ultraviolet spectrum to address flux discrepancies in the {\sc{atlas9}} model, we find that radiation affects atoms differently according to their ionisation state, with highly ionised species less affected by stellar radiation. Our results conclude that the stars most suitable for observing stellar contamination are those between 6,500 and 8,000 K, with neutral noble gases and ionised iron-peak elements as the most likely contaminants.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04746v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We study the mass-conserved reaction-diffusion system known as the wave-pinning model, which serves as a minimal framework for describing cell polarity. In this model, the interplay between reaction kinetics and slow diffusion forms a sharp interface that partitions the domain into high- and low-concentration regions. We perform a detailed asymptotic analysis and derive higher-order approximation equations governing the motion of this interface. Our results show that on a fast timescale, the interface evolves via propagating front dynamics, whereas on a slow timescale, it evolves as an area-preserving mean curvature flow. Furthermore, using the derived free boundary problem, we demonstrate that on a significantly slower timescale, an interface whose endpoints lie on the domain boundary drifts along the boundary toward regions of higher curvature. In summary, our analysis reveals that the interface dynamics in the wave-pinning model exhibit a hierarchy of three distinct timescales: wave propagation on a fast timescale, curvature-driven area-preserving evolution on a slow timescale, and motion along the boundary on a significantly slower timescale.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> A white paper roadmap linking stellar evolution, dusty discs/winds, and planet formation/retention across a star’s lifetime, with limited direct relevance to origins-of-life chemistry or biosignature-focused astrobiology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.17976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Stars and planets form, live, and evolve in unison. Throughout the life of a star, dusty circumstellar discs and stellar outflows influence the further evolution of both the star(s) and their orbiting planet(s). Planet-forming discs, winds of red giant branch (RGB) or asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, and post-RGB/post-AGB discs are examples of such host environments where dust physics plays a key role. The physical processes that occur during each of these stages establishes how the Solar System as well as exoplanetary systems were formed, are evolving, and will eventually die. This White Paper aims to bridge the fields of stellar evolution and planet formation by peering into the dust kinematics and macrostructure formation, and its effect on planet-host interaction, in dusty environments from stellar birth to death. Near-future advancements in the 2030s will enable the detection, orbital monitoring and atmospheric/mineralogical characterisation of close-in (proto)planets across diverse stages of stellar evolution. To take full advantage of these developments by the 2040s, we should develop the capabilities required to image the varied dusty environments in which planets are entrained over their lifetime. This will enable extensive testing of current theoretical understandings - from the micro-scales of dust assembly to the deeply interlinked macro-scales of planet-host interactions - across diverse settings often too small, distant, and faint to be resolved in the next decade, simultaneously providing valuable constraints on the two-way interplay of dusty host environments and planetary formation/evolution.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05092v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This paper bridges this critical gap by providing a systematic examination of the beamforming codebook technology, i.e., precoding matrix indicator (PMI), in the 5G NR from theoretical, standardization, and implementation perspectives. We begin by introducing the background of beamforming in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems and the signaling procedures for codebook-based beamforming in practical 5G systems. Then, we establish the fundamentals of regular codebooks and port-selection codebooks in 3GPP standards. Next, we provide rigorous technical analysis of 3GPP codebook evolution spanning Releases 15-18, with particular focus on: 1) We elucidate the core principles underlying codebook design, 2) provide clear physical interpretations for each symbolic variable in the codebook formulas, summarized in tabular form, and 3) offer intuitive visual illustrations to explain how codebook parameters convey information. These essential pedagogical elements are almost entirely absent in the often-obscure standardization documents. Through mathematical modeling, performance benchmarking, feedback comparisons, and scenario-dependent applicability analysis, we provide researchers and engineers with a unified understanding of beamforming codebooks in real-world systems. Furthermore, we identify future directions and other beamforming scenarios for ongoing research and development efforts. This work serves as both an informative tutorial and a guidance for future research, facilitating more effective collaboration between academia and industry in advancing wireless communication technologies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04484v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We present a detailed transit photometric analysis of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-12 b using data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). The study is based on publicly available calibrated light curves and target pixel files accessed through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST) cloud infrastructure. After extracting and normalizing the photometric time series, the light curve was phase-folded using an initial ephemeris and modeled with a physical transit model to determine the system&#x27;s geometric parameters. From the transit modeling, we measure the planet-to-star radius ratio, orbital inclination, impact parameter, and transit duration. Adopting stellar parameters from the literature, we derive the planetary radius and transit depth, confirming the highly inflated nature of WASP-12 b. Individual mid-transit times were measured and used to refine the orbital ephemeris through a weighted linear fit. The resulting refined orbital period and reference epoch improve the predictive accuracy of future transit times over the TESS observational baseline. An observed-minus-calculated (O-C) analysis reveals no statistically significant transit timing variations, indicating that the timing data are consistent with a linear ephemeris within the measurement uncertainties. This work demonstrates the capability of TESS photometry to provide precise transit characterization and ephemeris refinement for well-studied exoplanet systems, and provides updated parameters that are relevant for future atmospheric and dynamical investigations of WASP-12 b.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2402.06677v5 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Quantum entanglement manifests itself in non-local correlations between the constituents of a system. In its simplest realization, a measurement on one subsystem is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation.

Here, we argue that all forms of multipartite entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a physical state as it heats up, evolves in time in a large family of dynamical protocols, or as its parts become separated. We focus on the generic case where the system interacts with an environment. These results mainly follow from the geometry of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium, and a quantum spin chain. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that protects bipartite quantum correlations. However, genuinely collective fermionic entanglement disappears during typical evolution, thus sharing the same fate as in bosonic systems. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04315v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: At high eccentricities, tidal forcing excites vibrational modes within orbiting bodies known as dynamical tides. In this paper, we implement the coupled evolution of these modes with the body&#x27;s orbit in the \texttt{REBOUNDx} framework, an extension to the popular $N$-body integrator \texttt{REBOUND}. We provide a variety of test cases relevant to exoplanet dynamics and demonstrate overall agreement with prior studies of dynamical tides in the secular regime. Our implementation is readily applied to various high-eccentricity scenarios and allows for fast and accurate $N$-body investigations of astrophysical systems for which dynamical tides are relevant.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04433v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The integration of multicarrier modulation and multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) is critical for reliable transmission of wireless signals in complex environments, which significantly improve spectrum efficiency. Existing studies have shown that popular orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) offer significant advantages over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) in uncoded doubly selective channels. However, it remains uncertain whether these benefits extend to coded systems. Meanwhile, the information-theoretic limit analysis of coded MIMO multicarrier systems and the corresponding low-complexity receiver design remain unclear. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-slot cross-domain memory approximate message passing (MS-CD-MAMP) receiver as well as develops its information-theoretic (i.e., achievable rate) limit and optimal coding principle for MIMO-multicarrier modulation (e.g., OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM) systems. The proposed MS-CD-MAMP receiver can exploit not only the time domain channel sparsity for low complexity but also the corresponding symbol domain constellation constraints for performance enhancement. Meanwhile, limited by the high-dimensional complex state evolution (SE), a simplified single-input single-output variational SE is proposed to derive the achievable rate of MS-CD-MAMP and the optimal coding principle with the goal of maximizing the achievable rate. Numerical results show that coded MIMO-OFDM/OTFS/AFDM with MS-CD-MAMP achieve the same maximum achievable rate in doubly selective channels, whose finite-length performance with practical optimized low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes is only 0.5 $\sim$ 1.8 dB away from the associated theoretical limit, and has 0.8 $\sim$ 4.4 dB gain over the well-designed point-to-point LDPC codes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.07220v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Recent progress in open many-body quantum systems has highlighted the importance of the Markov length, the characteristic scale over which conditional correlations decay. It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany-Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04874v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: A highly diluted aqueous solution of histamine was studied by molecular dynamics using the TIP3P and SPC/E water models. It was shown that the local structure of the solution around histamine is determined by local Coulomb interactions and hydrogen bonds and is practically independent of the choice of the water model. Dynamic analysis based on the mean square displacement functions revealed a significant dependence of the diffusion behavior of histamine on the water model. It was found that the TIP3P water model leads to overestimated values of the diffusion coefficients of water and histamine and a transition to the diffusion mode of motion. It was found that the SPC/E water model provides slower dynamics of the solution components, and the values of the diffusion coefficients are in better agreement with experimental data. It was shown that the dynamics of histamine is highly sensitive to the choice of the water model, and the SPC/E model is more suitable for the correct description of the dynamic properties of the ``histamine--water&#x27;&#x27; system under physiological conditions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a two-parameter memory-weighted velocity (fractional-derivative-like) operator for history-dependent dynamical systems, with no direct connection to origins-of-life chemistry or biology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05122v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The modeling of dynamical systems whose present state depends on their history often requires generalizations of the classical concept of a derivative. This work introduces a **memory-weighted velocity operator** \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}\) designed to quantify rates of change while incorporating time-varying, power-law memory. The operator is defined via a kernel with two independent, continuous memory exponents \(\alpha(t)\) and \(\beta(t)\), which separately weight the influence of past state increments and the scaling of elapsed time. For a function \(x\), the resulting quantity \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}[x]\) represents its memory-weighted rate of change. We establish fundamental properties of this operator, including its explicit integral representation, linearity, and a key result on the **continuous dependence** of \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}[x]\) on the exponents \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) with respect to uniform convergence. Furthermore, we examine the special **uniform-memory** case \(\alpha=\beta\equiv1\), proving that \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}[x](t)\) **asymptotically recovers** the classical derivative \(\dot{x}(0)\) as \(t \to 0^{+}\), thereby ensuring consistency with standard calculus. The analysis is supported by self-contained appendices providing necessary technical tools. The framework developed here offers a well-defined mathematical object for describing memory-dependent dynamics, with potential utility in formulating and analyzing evolution equations that feature adaptively weighted historical information.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05120v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) determines the bulk evolution and observable emission in a wide variety of high-energy astrophysical phenomena. Due to their complexity, RHD problems must usually be studied through numerical simulation. We have extended the publicly available RICH code, which previously solved the equations of RHD in the limit of grey flux-limited diffusion (FLD), to operate with a multigroup FLD solver. RICH is a semi-Lagrangian code that solves the equations of RHD on an unstructured moving mesh, and is the first multigroup RHD moving mesh code, making it uniquely applicable to problems with extreme dynamic range and dynamically important radiation forces. We validate our multigroup module against multiple analytic benchmarks, including a novel test of the RHD Doppler term. The computational efficiency of the code is aided by a novel scheme to accelerate convergence in optically thick cells. Finally, we apply multigroup RICH in a pilot study of a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), using a $10^4 M_\odot$ intermediate-mass black hole. Our simulations self-consistently produce a bright early-time X-ray flash prior to peak optical/UV light, in qualitative agreement with post-processing of (grey) RICH simulations of supermassive black hole TDEs, as well as X-ray observations of the TDE AT 2022dsb.</p>

To do so, we study evolutionary dynamics in which individuals experience mutations, reproduction, and selection using variants of the Moran model. We show that, in the large population size limit, the impact of reproduction and selection amounts to realizing a large-deviation dynamics for the non-interacting random walk in which individuals simply explore the genome landscape due to mutations. This mapping, which holds at all times, allows us to recast transitions in the population genome distribution as dynamical phase transitions, which can then be studied using the toolbox of large-deviation theory.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.09057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: By introducing an extra stack of D6-branes to standard ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, we extend the landscape of its complete search. In this construction, the $d$-stack of D6-branes is introduced besides the standard $a,~b,~c$-stacks. More intersections from the extra stacks of D6-branes appear, and thus Higgs/Higgs-like particles arise from more origins. Among these models, we find eight new classes of ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with gauge symmetries $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_{R_1}\times SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{R}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$, where $d$-stack of D6-branes carries the gauge symmetries $SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(2)_{L_2}$, respectively. The $SU(2)_{L_1/R_1} \times SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ can be broken down to the diagonal $SU(2)_{L/R}$ gauge symmetry via bifundamental Higgs fields. In such a way, we for the first time successfully constructed three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from non-rigid D6-branes with extra $d$-stacks of D6-branes as visible sectors. Interestingly, by introducing extra stack of D6-branes to the standard supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, the number of filler brane reduces in general, and eventually the models without any $USp(N)$ gauge symmetry present. This reduces the exotic particles from filler brane intersection yet provides more vector-like particles from ${\cal N}=2$ subsector that are useful in renormalization group equation evolution as an advantage. Moreover, interesting degeneracy behavior with the same gauge coupling ratio exists in certain class of models.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.05031v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: When simulating three-dimensional flows interacting with deformable and elastic obstacles, current methods often encounter complexities in the governing equations and challenges in numerical implementation. In this work, we introduce a novel numerical formulation for simulating incompressible viscous flows at low Reynolds numbers in the presence of deformable interfaces. Our method employs a vorticity-stream vector formulation that significantly simplifies the fluid solver, transforming it into a set of coupled Poisson problems. The body-fluid interface is modeled using a phase field, allowing for the incorporation of various free-energy models to account for membrane bending and surface tension. In contrast to existing three-dimensional approaches, such as Lattice Boltzmann Methods or boundary-integral techniques, our formulation is lightweight and grounded in classical fluid mechanics principles, making it implementable with standard finite-difference techniques. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method by simulating the evolution of a single vesicle or droplet in Newtonian Poiseuille and Couette flows under different free-energy models, successfully recovering canonical axisymmetric shapes and stress profiles. Although this work primarily focuses on single-body dynamics in Newtonian suspending fluids, the framework can be extended to include body forces, inertial effects, and viscoelastic media.</p>

To overcome the high computational cost of PF in solving complex PDEs, machine learning methods such as PINNs, convLSTM have been used to predict PF evolution. However, current methods still face shortages of low flexibility, poor generalization and short predicting time length. In this work, we present a joint framework coupling voxel-flow network (VFN) with PF simulations in an alternating manner for long-horizon temporal prediction of microstructure evolution. The VFN iteratively predicts future evolution by learning the flow of pixels from past snapshots, with periodic boundaries preserved in the process. Periodical PF simulations suppresses nonphysical artifacts, reduces accumulated error, and extends reliable prediction time length. The VFN is about 1,000 times faster than PF simulation on GPU. In validation using grain growth and spinodal decomposition, MSE and SSIM remain 6.76% and 0.911 when predicted 18 frames from only 2 input frames, outperforming similar predicting methods. For an ultra-long grain growth prediction for 82 frames from 2 input frames, grain number decreases from 600 to 29 with NMSE of average grain area remaining 1.64%. This joint framework enables rapid, generalized, flexible and physically consistent microstructure forecasting from image-based data for ultra-long time scales.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2501.18620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: As a core element of culture, images transform perception into structured representations and undergo evolution similar to natural languages. Given that visual input accounts for 60% of human sensory experience, it is natural to ask whether images follow statistical regularities similar to those in linguistic systems. Guided by symbol-grounding theory, which posits that meaningful symbols originate from perception, we treat images as vision-centric artifacts and employ pre-trained neural networks to model visual processing. By detecting kernel activations and extracting pixels, we obtain text-like units, which reveal that these image-derived representations adhere to statistical laws such as Zipf&#x27;s, Heaps&#x27;, and Benford&#x27;s laws, analogous to linguistic data. Notably, these statistical regularities emerge spontaneously, without the need for explicit symbols or hybrid architectures. Our results indicate that connectionist networks can automatically develop structured, quasi-symbolic units through perceptual processing alone, suggesting that text- and symbol-like properties can naturally emerge from neural networks and providing a novel perspective for interpretation.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This biomedical study shows that [225Ac]Ac-FAPI-04 radionuclide therapy induces DNA damage and remodels the tumor microenvironment via IL-27/JAK-STAT activation and Tnfaip3 downregulation to enhance cytotoxic T cell immunity, but it is not relevant to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Background: Accumulating evidence substantiates the capacity of targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) to potentiate tumor immunotherapy responses. However, combining TRT and immunotherapies exhibits substantial varying efficacy, underscoring the importance of investigating mechanisms through which TRT remodels the tumor microenvironment (TME). Despite recent advancements, the specific signaling molecules mediated by TRT that regulate the functions of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) remain unclear. Methods: Given the demonstrated potential of -radionuclides targeting the fibroblast activation protein (FAP) in TRT, this study employed [225Ac]Ac-FAPI-04 to investigate the mechanisms of TRT-induced TME remodeling. The cytotoxic effects were first evaluated in the B16F10 cell line, followed by an assessment of its in vivo therapeutic efficacy in tumor-bearing mice. RNA-sequencing analysis was utilized to elucidate underlying signaling pathways involving immune responses. Results: [225Ac]Ac-FAPI-04 significantly induced DNA double-strand breaks, further elevated ROS levels, and apoptosis in tumor cells. Transcriptomic profiling revealed that [225Ac]Ac-FAPI-04 activates the IL-27/JAK-STAT pathway to amplify interferon-mediated responses, indicating IL-27 serves as a critical regulatory signal for CTLs during TRT. A concomitant observation was the downregulation of Tnfaip3 following [225Ac]Ac-FAPI-04 treatment. Tnfaip3 is implicated in modulating CTLs&#x27; behavior and intratumoral infiltration, while its downregulation was associated with the upregulation of cytotoxic effector molecules, as confirmed in this study. Conclusion: This study identifies a TRT-induced pattern of synergistic signaling mediated by IL-27 and Tnfaip3, which collectively enhances CTL recruitment and potentiates their cytotoxic function. These findings provide a detailed mechanistic rationale for strategies aimed at augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of TRT and immunotherapy combinations.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Using engineered recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae × S. paradoxus hybrids and lab evolution, the study finds hybrid fitness is shaped mainly by widespread weak, background-dependent genetic incompatibilities and compensatory adaptation rather than rare strong lethal incompatibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Species barriers limit gene flow and maintain co-adapted genomes. Interspecific hybridization can break down species barriers to reveal genetic incompatibilities. Although the phenotypic and genomic consequences of hybridization have been extensively studied in many systems, far less is known about the longer-term evolutionary dynamics of highly divergent, mosaic genomes and the extent to which genetic incompatibilities shape their adaptation. In yeast, pre-zygotic barriers are weak but post-zygotic barriers are strong due to mispairing of chromosomes during meiosis. By suppressing anti-recombination genes in meiosis, we generated a panel of 20 haploid recombinant hybrids from a cross between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its sister species, Saccharomyces paradoxus. Across conditions, these hybrids are, on average, less fit than either parent and show broad phenotypic variation. Inheritance patterns of protein complexes in the hybrid genomes reveal no evidence of pairwise lethality but do support a model of pervasive weak negative genetic interactions in hybrid protein complexes. We show by laboratory evolution that each recombinant genome follows a distinct evolutionary trajectory, and a small subset of hybrid protein complexes and loci show hybrid-specific mutational targeting. Finally, we show that species-of-origin alleles can bias evolutionary outcomes by reshaping selection on interacting genes. Together, our results suggest that strong pairwise incompatibilities are rare, while weak, background-dependent incompatibilities are widespread and shape fitness and adaptation in hybrid genomes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The 14-3-3 protein family, with over 1300 binding partners, is one of the largest regulators of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in eukaryotic cells. They recognise and bind to phosphorylation-related motifs in their partner proteins, creating scaffolds to stabilise proteins and allowing or inhibiting kinases` access to their targets. 14-3-3 consists of seven isoforms ({beta}, {gamma}, {epsilon}, {zeta}, , {theta} and {sigma}), which are expressed across all tissues. Given their important role in PPIs, their dysregulation can contribute to a variety of diseases, such as cancer or neurodegenerative disorders like Creutzfeldt-Jakob`s, Parkinson`s or Alzheimer`s diseases. Pathological effects can arise due to loss of function, aberrant interactions or protein aggregation. Notably, 14-3-3 aggregates have been detected in Lewy bodies or cerebrospinal fluid, mirroring the presence of amyloid proteins, such as -synuclein or {beta}-amyloid. Toxic amyloid aggregation signals the onset of neurodegeneration, which can occur through misfolding of proteins or liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) -- a process during which proteins condense into membraneless organelles. Unlike other amyloidogenic proteins, there is little information on the conditions under which the 14-3-3 protein family members undergo LLPS or their relationship with amyloid aggregation. To address this gap, we examined all isoforms of 14-3-3 in vitro and observed the formation of amyloid aggregates and phase-separated droplets. Our results revealed that the {epsilon} and {theta} isoforms form worm-like fibrils, and molecular crowding conditions promote phase separation in most of the 14-3-3 proteins.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Ophrys orchids (or bee orchids) provide an outstanding example of a plant adaptive radiation. Over the last five million years, this genus has diversified into hundreds of taxa as a result of its unconventional pollination strategy, known as &#x27;sexual swindling&#x27;. However, the rapid and substantial diversification of this genus, combined with its capacity for hybridisation and large genome size, poses significant challenges in addressing its systematics. We used phylotranscriptomics as a genome complexity reduction technique to infer the phylogenetic relationships among Ophrys main lineages. More than seven thousand gene trees enabled us to determine the relative contributions of gene flow and incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) in Ophrys evolution. First, we propose a new phylogenetic hypothesis for the genus with an unprecedented resolution that largely confirms the relationships between the main Ophrys lineages, but also provides new insights within each sub-genera. By combining phylogenetic network inference with introgression analyses based on gene tree topologies and branch lengths, we then show that the numerous phylogenetic incongruences among gene tree topologies result from a pervasive background of ILS, over which stand out several well-supported, ancient and potentially adaptive gene flow events between lineages. These major gene flow events provide a new perspective on the evolution of the Ophrys genus and its pollination, questioning previous hypotheses inferred without considering its reticulate evolution, and providing a better understanding of discrepancies observed among previous phylogenetic studies of the genus.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding how transcriptional output and chromatin accessibility coordinate across cellular states remains a central challenge in multimodal single-cell biology. Here, we establish explicit hierarchical empirical bounds on RNA-chromatin statistical dependence using a strictly falsification-driven, information-theoretic analysis of paired RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. Our contribution is not to assert universal coupling, but to quantify the maximum intra-state coupling that survives adversarial nulls, thereby converting qualitative intuition into empirical bounds. Leveraging unimodal latent representations and adversarial null models, we quantify both the existence and the limits of cross-modal dependence across organizational scales. At the population level, global RNA-ATAC mutual information is strong and reproducible across donors, but is shown to be overwhelmingly dominated by cell-type composition rather than fine-grained regulatory coordination. When cellular state is explicitly controlled, intra-state RNA-ATAC coupling collapses to null expectations in the majority of populations, directly falsifying the hypothesis of a universal within-state regulatory channel. Despite this collapse, a weak but statistically robust residual coupling persists in a restricted subset of highly dynamic states, including erythroid differentiation compartments, activated T cells, and NK cells. This residual signal survives stringent local permutation tests and conditional mutual information analysis, demonstrating that it cannot be reduced to compositional mixing alone. Quantitatively, residual within-state dependence is consistently an order of magnitude smaller than global dependence, placing an empirical upper bound on within-state RNA-ATAC coordination in this dataset. Donor-resolved ratios rho = I(R;A|S)/I(R;A) indicate that most of the global dependence is removed by conditioning on state; operationally, we refer to the removed fraction (1 - rho) as composition-dominated dependence. Throughout, &quot;state-contingent statistical dependence&quot; is used strictly as an operational descriptor rather than a causal claim: mutual information and conditional mutual information quantify statistical dependence only, not directionality or mechanism. This framing constrains downstream mechanistic interpretation and future multimodal modeling.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> DeepKOALA is a fast GRU-based deep learning tool for KEGG Orthology assignment that accelerates large-scale DNA/protein functional annotation but is only indirectly relevant to origins-of-life research as a general bioinformatics enabler.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The KEGG Orthology (KO) system links DNA and protein sequences to biological functions and pathways, providing a curated, fundamental and consistent annotation framework across all domains of life. While accurate, traditional sequence alignment-based annotation methods are computationally expensive, which severely limits their application in large-scale datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce DeepKOALA, a deep learning approach based on Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), which frames KO annotation as an open-set recognition task. This design reduces false positives arising from out-of-scope sequences and, together with a lightweight GRU backbone, enables high-throughput annotation. The GRU-based model was benchmarked against four other deep learning architectures and showed the best balance between speed and accuracy. We further performed a cross-species evaluation of DeepKOALA in comparison with existing KO annotation tools, where it achieved an F1-score of 0.8653 and 37.5-fold acceleration compared with BlastKOALA. We also provide a specialized fragment model for handling incomplete sequences and an optional Multi-domain mode. Together, these features make DeepKOALA a scalable, efficient, and accurate solution for high-throughput function annotation.</p>

Here, we show that RNA polymerases II and polymerase III form distinct nuclear foci at the 5S ribosomal DNA (rDNA)-Spliced leader 1 (SL1) cluster in C. elegans. Within this cluster, polymerase II binds to the SL1 gene, while polymerase III associates with 5S rDNA. Both polymerase foci display dynamic but distinct behaviors within the nucleus. The assembly of these polymerase foci is regulated across the cell cycle. ATTF-6, an AT-hook transcription factor, is essential for polymerases II foci formation but dispensable for polymerases III foci. While Pol III foci are largely resistant to temperature changes, Pol II foci are temperature-sensitive, and their dissolution correlates with reduced SL1 expression. Together, these results reveal a spatial and temporal regulation of two RNA polymerases that organize gene cluster transcription.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Proposes a Bayesian circuit–Hamiltonian “Gated Quantum Resonator” formalism to model catalysis and tunneling/coherence effects in complex reactive systems, offering a potentially useful (but indirect) theoretical tool for origins-of-life chemistry via improved mechanistic discrimination without explicit long-timescale MD/QM-MM trajectories.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Molecular dynamics (MD) and hybrid quantum–classical (QM/MM) methods provide powerful tools for simulating chemical and biological systems, yet their application to long-timescale, strongly coupled processes remains limited by non-integrability, chaotic sensitivity, and extreme time-scale separation. These limitations motivate complementary formalisms that emphasize structure, constraint, and evidence integration over brute-force trajectory resolution. Here we introduce the Gated Quantum Resonator (GQR) framework, a Bayesian circuit–Hamiltonian formalism in which reactive coordinates are modeled as coupled vibronic–electronic resonators with gateable interactions. Linearization around operating points maps the effective Hamiltonian onto electrical network analogues, enabling transparent parameterization and rapid Bayesian updating from spectroscopic and mechanistic evidence. The framework provides a unified language for describing non-Arrhenius kinetics, tunnelling assisted by constrained vibronic coherence, and mode-selective transport in open quantum systems. Without resolving full many-body trajectories, GQR identifies protected dynamical subspaces in which coherent evolution can persist under environmental coupling. This formulation is applicable across enzymatic catalysis, heterogeneous and electrocatalytic systems, and radiative phenomena, offering a tractable complement to conventional simulation approaches for hypothesis generation, model reduction, and mechanistic discrimination.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Folded RNA structures are increasingly being recognised as key regulators in biological processes, yet the RNA i-motif remains poorly characterised due to its low stability and lack of selective molecular probes. Here, we describe the first small molecule – a short peptide – that binds the elusive RNA i-motif. Our minimalist peptide RGGFGGRGG is derived from the intrinsically disordered region of the protein Nucleolin and binds to folded RNA over DNA with &gt;5x selectivity. The binding of two peptide molecules folds the RNA i-motif at a higher pH than under native conditions. This folded, peptide-bound structure can still bind other guests, such as the intercalator thiazole orange, displaying heteroallosteric properties. Our peptide binding is driven by more than simple electrostatic attraction, exploiting the subtle differences in steric complementarity and hydration of the compact RNA structures relative to DNA congeners and unfolded strands. Our findings underline the potential of minimalistic peptide scaffolds as selective binders for non-canonical RNA structures, allowing for the probing and modulation of RNA topologies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Leroy Cronin, Sara I. Walker Assembly theory (AT) introduces a concept of causation as a material property, constitutive of a metrology of evolution and selection. The physical scale for causation is quantified with the assembly index, defined as the minimum number of steps necessary for a distinguishable object to exist, where steps are assembled recursively. Observing countable copies of high assembly index objects indicates that a mechanism to produce them is persistent, such that the object&#x27;s environment builds a memory that traps causation within a contingent chain. Copy number and assembly index underlie the standardized metrology for detecting causation (assembly index), and evidence of contingency (copy number). Together, these allow the precise definition of a selective threshold in assembly space, understood as the set of all causal possibilities. This threshold demarcates life (and its derivative agential, intelligent and technological forms) as structures with persistent copies beyond the threshold. In introducing a fundamental concept of material causation to explain and measure life, AT represents a departure from prior theories of causation, such as interventional ones, which have so far proven incompatible with fundamental physics. We discuss how AT&#x27;s concept of causation provides the foundation for a theory of physics where novelty, contingency and the potential for open-endedness are fundamental, and determinism is emergent along assembled lineages.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chirality can arise through supramolecular curvature that resolves geometric frustrations in the packing of bent, achiral molecular or colloidal building blocks. Here, we leverage orthogonal protection-deprotection click chemistry to create sequence-defined mesogenic heterodimers exhibiting emergent chirality. We compare the hierarchical self-assembly of the synthesized asymmetric, achiral heterodimers which differ only in the position of a methyl substituent. Both dimers form chiral spherulites composed of nanocylinders. However, the detailed arrangement of nanocylinders depends on the position of the methyl substituent and the crystallization conditions. Despite the chemical similarity, in one dimer, two crystalline forms exhibit optical rotation indicating the presence of chiral domains, while the crystalline phase of the other dimer does not exhibit optical rotation yet adopts a chiral assembly of nanocylinders. We propose that differences in nanocylinder arrangements may arise from changes in nanocylinder curvature and dimensions dictated by the methyl substituent position, inducing these divergent spontaneously chiral behaviors. These results highlight the role of sequence and molecular design in directing the bottom-up hierarchical self-assembly and chirality of mesogenic systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03399v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: A multifractal model is used to analyze neutron evolution within a reactor. For chain reactions, various characteristics of multifractal neutron behavior have been determined. These include the dimension of the multifractal carrier, information and correlation dimensions, the entropy of the fractal set, maximum and minimum dimension values, and the multifractal spectrum function. The geometric features of a multifractal allow for the description of a stochastic system consisting of hierarchically subordinate statistical ensembles, which are characterized by Cayley trees. A stationary distribution over hierarchical levels is established, which follows the Tsallis power law. The text also points out some potential applications of fractal patterns in nuclear reactor theory. The chance of percolation, which is when we see a state in the Bethe lattice where there&#x27;s at least one continuous path through neighboring conducting nodes all the way across, is similar to the likelihood of a self-sustaining fission chain reaction happening. When this probability hits a critical point, we get a (conditionally) infinite cluster of neutrons forming. The percolation probability, influenced by how long the reactor has been running and its size, is linked to the reactor&#x27;s criticality. We take a look at how the neutron multiplication factor behaves over time. We especially focus on the early stages of a self-sustaining nuclear fission chain reaction. We also highlight the ways to identify the boundaries of the critical region.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2504.20576v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We consider a Klein-Gordon-Wave system, describing the evolution of a massive field and a massless one interacting through a Yukawa-like coupling, and we explicitly derive its Hamiltonian normal form to first and second order. To the first-order approximation, the normal form results in a Schr\&quot;odinger-Wave system, which reduces to the Schr\&quot;odinger-Poisson one in the singular limit of vanishing perturbative parameter. The second-order approximation provides the successive corrections to the Schr\&quot;odinger-Wave system, and is presented in order to show that higher-order approximations to all orders can be obtained by iterating our constructive procedure. The normal form technique adopted here formally extends the standard Birkhoff normal form procedure for harmonic oscillators to include a set of free particles in the unperturbed problem. The mathematical result obtained here might explain, for example, the &quot;cooling&quot; process of ultra-light dark matter, the approximate validity of the Schr\&quot;odinger-Poisson system describing its dynamics and the long term conservation of the total dark matter mass.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03335v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to evolve solutions to problems in many domains, in a process inspired by biological evolution. However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called &quot;Red Queen&quot; dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03408v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: With the arrival of JWST observations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, it is timely to reassess the contribution of tidal heating to their heat budget. JWST thermal phase curves could reveal endogenic heating through an anomalously high nightside temperature, providing an opportunity to estimate tidal heating. In this study, we revisit the tidal heating of these planets and propose a simple method to compute the tidal heating profile across a broad range of parameters. Our approach leverages a known formulation for synchronously rotating planets on low-eccentricity orbits and the fact that the profile shape depends solely on internal structure. We calculate the tidal heating contributions for all T-1 planets, with a particular focus on the impact of internal structure and eccentricity uncertainties on their total heat budget. Although the masses and radii of these planets are well constrained, degeneracies remain in their internal structure and composition. For volatile-poor planets of silicate-rock compositions, we investigate the role of core iron content by exploring a range of core sizes. For each structure, we compute the degree-two gravitational Love number, $k_2$, and the corresponding tidal heating profiles. We assume sub-solidus temperatures profiles that are decoupled from interior heat production, which means our estimates are conservative and likely represent minimum values. We find that the tidal heat flux for T-1b and c can exceed Io&#x27;s heat flux, with uncertainties primarily driven by eccentricity. These high fluxes may be detectable with JWST. For T-1f to g, the tidal flux remains below Earth&#x27;s geothermal flux, suggesting that tidal heating is unlikely to be the dominant energy source. For planets d and e, however, tidal heating likely dominates their heat budget, potentially driving intense volcanic and tectonic activity, which could enhance their habitability prospects.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces ARRDE, a Differential Evolution variant with nonlinear population-size reduction and adaptive restart-refine, validated as top-performing across multiple CEC benchmark suites but not related to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.18429v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: This study is motivated by a robustness issue in numerical optimization of bound-constrained problems: many algorithms that perform well on a particular benchmark suite, such as the IEEE CEC2017 problems, struggle to maintain the same level of performance when applied to other suites that differ in dimensionality, landscape complexity, or the maximum number of function evaluations ($N_{\text{max}}$). To address this, we propose the Adaptive Restart-Refine Differential Evolution (ARRDE) algorithm, a new variant of Differential Evolution (DE). ARRDE builds upon the LSHADE algorithm, incorporates key mechanisms from jSO, and introduces a nonlinear population-size reduction strategy combined with an adaptive restart-refine mechanism. We evaluate ARRDE on five benchmark suites (CEC2011, CEC2017, CEC2019, CEC2020, and CEC2022) which, to the best of our knowledge, constitutes the most extensive experimental study to date in the context of algorithmic comparison, as most prior works consider only one or two suites. This broad evaluation enables a rigorous assessment of generalization across markedly different problem characteristics. To further support fair cross-suite comparisons, we also introduce a bounded accuracy-based scoring metric derived from relative error. Using both rank-based and accuracy-based metrics, and comparing against algorithms that perform strongly on CEC2017 (e.g., jSO and LSHADE-cnEpSin) as well as those that excel on CEC2020 (e.g., j2020 and NLSHADE-RSP), ARRDE consistently demonstrates top-tier performance, ranking first across all benchmark suites considered. These results highlight ARRDE&#x27;s robustness and its superior generalization capability.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04032v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The models that most successfully reproduce the orbital architecture of the Solar System terrestrial planets start from a narrow annulus of material that grows into embryos and then planets. However, it is not clear how this ring model can be made consistent with the chemical structure of the inner Solar System, which shows a reduced-to-oxidized gradient from Mercury to Mars and a parallel gradient in the asteroid belt. We propose that there were two primary reservoirs in the early inner Solar System: a narrow, refractory enriched ring inside of 1 au, and a less massive, extended planetesimal disk outside of 1 au with oxidation states ranging from enstatite chondrites to ordinary chondrites. We show through a suite of N-body simulations that an inwardly sweeping secular resonance, caused by aerodynamic drag and perturbations from a mean-motion resonant Jupiter and Saturn, gathers the outer planetesimal disk into a narrow ring that migrates radially, forms Mars, and contributes oxidized material to proto-Earth. Remaining unaccreted planetesimals can be implanted into the asteroid belt as the parent bodies of aubrites and non-carbonaceous iron meteorites, while the most reduced material is not implanted and thus unsampled in the meteorite collection. This model explains the oxidation and isotopic gradients within the inner Solar System within the context of a low-viscosity, magnetic wind-driven disk.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Provides new THz–mid-IR optical constants for N₂ ice to improve radiative-transfer and snowline/disk-mass modeling in protoplanetary disks, indirectly informing volatile inventories relevant to habitable planet formation.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03951v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Context. Understanding the optical properties of astrophysical ices is crucial for modeling dust continuum emission and radiative transfer in cold, dense interstellar environments. Molecular nitrogen (N$_2$), a major nitrogen reservoir in protoplanetary disks, plays a key role in nitrogen chemistry, yet the lack of direct terahertz (THz)--infrared (IR) optical constants for N$_2$ ice introduces uncertainties in radiative transfer models, snowline locations, and disk mass estimates. Aims. We present direct measurements of the optical properties of N$_2$ ice over a broad THz--IR spectral range using terahertz pulsed spectroscopy (TPS) and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), supported by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and comparison with literature data. Methods. N$_2$ ice was grown at cryogenic temperatures by gas-phase deposition onto a cold silicon window. The THz complex refractive index was directly reconstructed from TPS data, while the IR response was derived from FTIR measurements using Kramers--Kronig relations. The optical response was parameterized with a Lorentz dielectric model and validated by DFT calculations. Results. The complex refractive index of N$_2$ ice is quantified from $\nu = 0.3$--$16$~THz ($\lambda = 1$~mm--$18.75~\mu$m). Resonant absorption peaks at $\nu_\mathrm{L} = 1.47$ and $2.13$~THz with damping constants $\gamma_\mathrm{L} = 0.03$ and $0.22$~THz are attributed to optically active phonons of the $\alpha$-N$_2$ crystal. Conclusions. We provide a complete set of the THz--IR optical constants for \ce{N2} ice by combining TPS and FTIR spectroscopy. Our results have implications for future observational and modeling studies of protoplanetary disk evolution and planet formation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03932v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Planets with masses between Earth and Neptune often have radii that imply the presence of volatiles, suggesting that water may be abundant in their interiors. However, directly observing the precise water mass fraction and water distribution remains unfeasible. In our study, we employ an internal structure code MAGRATHEA to model planets with high water content and explore potential interior distributions. Departing from traditional assumptions of a layered structure, we determine water and rock distribution based on water-rock miscibility criteria. We model {wet planets} with an iron core and a homogeneous mixture of rock and water above it. At the outer regions of the planet, the pressure and temperature are below the rock-water miscibility point (the second critical point), causing the segregation of water and rock. Consequently, a shell of water is formed in the outermost layers. By considering the water-rock miscibility and the vapor state of water, our approach highlights the uncertainty in estimating the water mass fraction of detected exoplanets.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03963v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how external photo-evaporation influences the formation, dynamical evolution and the resultant planetary architecture of multi-planet systems born in stellar clusters. We use a model of N-body simulations of multiple planet formation via pebble accretion coupled with a 1-D viscous disc subject to external photo-evaporation. We found that external photo-evaporation reduces the planet growth by reducing the pebble mass reservoir in discs containing multiple planetary embryos across a wide range of disc masses, and is particularly effective in suppressing planet growth in less initially massive discs (&lt; 0.1 M$_{\odot}$). However, in more initially massive ($\geq$ 0.1 M$_{\oplus}$) discs planets lost due to planet-planet interactions dominate the outcome for final resultant total planet mass, masking the effects of external photo-evaporation in curbing the planet mass growth. In terms of the final resulting planetary architectures, the signature of external photo-evaporation is visible in less massive (&lt; 0.1 M$_{\odot}$) discs, with fewer numbers and lower masses of planets surviving in discs irradiated with stronger external FUV radiation. External photo-evaporation also leaves a signature for the wide orbit (&gt; 10 au) terrestrial planets (0.1 - 1 M$_{\oplus}$), with fewer planets populating this region for stronger FUV field. Finally, the 1st-order resonant pairs fraction decreases with stronger FUV radiation, although the resonant pairs occur rarely regardless of the FUV radiation environment, due to the small number of planets that survive gravitational encounters.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03990v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We analyse the association between the NEAs 2021 PH27 and 2025 GN1, which share similar heliocentric Keplerian elements and the same taxonomic classification. First, we confirm the spectral similarity by getting independent colours measurements of 2025 GN1 and confirming that they are both X-type. From numerical integration of the orbits up to 100 kyr in the past, taking into account relativistic corrections, we found that the two asteroids experienced five similar flybys with Venus, but none of them were closer than the Roche limit. The perihelion distance also reached values between 0.1 and 0.08 au about 17/21 kyr and 45/48 kyr ago, but still well outside the Roche limit with the Sun. So, the origin of the pair by tidal disruption of a progenitor rubble-pile asteroid appears unlikely. On the other hand, we found periods lasting several thousand years where the perihelion was below 0.1 au, and this can lead to thermal fracturing of the surface. We found that the rotation period of the primary and the mass ratio secondary/primary make the pair indistinguishable from the binary systems known among the NEAs, and the YORP effect can double the rotation period of 2021 PH27 in $150 \pm 50$ kyr. So it is plausible that the pair was formed by the rotational disintegration of a rubble-pile asteroid due to anisotropic gas emission or the YORP effect, which formed a binary system that later dissolved due to the internal dynamics of the pair. We are unable to give a value for the separation age; we can only say that it occurred more than 10.5 kyr ago and may have occurred between 17/21 kyr ago during the last and longer phase of lower perihelion distance. In this scenario, little meteoroids released in space due to the fragmentation event are still near the pair&#x27;s orbit and can generate a meteor shower in Venus&#x27; atmosphere.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03350v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The context of the Sun in the galactic neighborhood is not well understood, especially when we compare its physical properties to those of nearby stars. Thereby, we still cannot fully comprehend whether or not the Sun is a typical star. This work aims to identify and characterize stars aligned with the solar evolutionary track that could represent it at the ZAMS and subgiant stages. We performed a spectroscopic analysis of 18 photometrically selected candidates using high-resolution and high-SNR spectra as well as the classical spectroscopic method, based on the excitation and ionization equilibria of Fe I and Fe II lines. Additionally, we derived evolutionary parameters using isochrones, and kinematic parameters. We also estimated chromospheric activity levels and performed age estimates through 3 additional independent methods: activity-age relations using the Ca II H $\&amp;$ K and H$\alpha$ lines, and rotation periods estimated from TESS light curves. We identified three candidates that provide a good match to the Sun at $\approx$ 0.5 Gyr (HD 13531 and HD 61033) and subgiant (HD 148577) stages. Moreover, HD 197210 could be of interest when studying the Sun at $\approx$ 2 Gyr, when the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere started having a significant amount of oxygen. Our selection method was successful and we were able to identify stars similar to the Sun at different evolutionary stages, which is essential for future research in the search of exoplanets and understand habitability, especially with the advent of the next generation of exoplanet-hunting instruments.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.23542v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Surviving rapid inward orbital migration is a crucial aspect of formation models for the Jupiter&#x27;s Galilean moons. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the orbital migration of the Galilean moons by incorporating self-consistent solid dynamics in circumjovian disk models. We perform two-fluid simulations using the FARGO3D code on a 2D polar grid. The simulations model a satellite with the mass of a proto-moon, Europa, or Ganymede interacting with a circumjovian disk. The dust component, coupled to the gas via a drag force, is characterized by the dust-to-gas mass ratio ($\epsilon$) and the Stokes number ($T_s$). The effect of solids fundamentally alter the satellites&#x27; evolution. We identify a vast parameter space where migration is slowed, halted, robustly reversed -leading to outward migration-, or significantly accelerated inward. The migration rate is dependent on satellite mass, providing a natural source of differential migration. Solid dynamics provides a robust and self-consistent mechanism that fundamentally alters the migration of the Galilean moons, potentially addressing the long-standing migration catastrophe. This mechanism critically affects the survival of satellites and could offer a viable physical process to explain the establishment of resonances through differential migration. These findings establish that solid torques are a critical, non-negligible factor in shaping the final architecture of satellite systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04091v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The earliest stages of disk formation and dust evolution during the protostellar phase remain poorly constrained. Millimeter dust emission and its polarization provide key insights into the physical processes and material distribution at the envelope-disk interface. We present ALMA polarimetric observations at 1.4 mm and 3 mm of two young stellar objects in Taurus, IRAS 04166+2706 (K04166) and IRAS 04169+2702 (K04169), probing scales from 25 au to 3000 au. We model the Stokes I emission to separate disk and envelope contributions and analyze the polarization properties to identify the dominant polarization mechanisms. K04166 shows extended Stokes I and polarized emission tracing a tentative hourglass magnetic field morphology in its envelope. In the inner envelope and disk (&lt; 100 au), the properties of the polarized emission change, suggesting either a toroidal magnetic field or the presence of large grains. In contrast, K04169 exhibits compact Stokes I and polarized emission consistent with self-scattering from the disk. Both disks are extremely compact, but only K04166 retains a substantial envelope. Our multiscale ALMA polarimetric observations reveal a transition from magnetically aligned grains in envelopes to self-scattering in disks within the transition region of 20-50 au. These results provide important clues on dust grain growth and magnetic field morphology at the disk-envelope scales. Despite being embedded in the same filament, the two sources display striking differences, indicating that K04166 is a young embedded object with a substantial envelope threaded by relatively organized magnetic fields. Meanwhile, K04169 is more evolved, likely to be a young T-Tauri star. However, in both disks, the presence of large grains already suggests a scenario of early dust evolution in disks of the Class 0 stage.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.16056v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Gravitational scattering of small bodies (planetesimals) by a planet remains a fundamental problem in celestial mechanics. It is traditionally modeled within the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP), where individual particle trajectories are obtained via numerical integrations. Here, we use {\&quot;O}pik&#x27;s close-encounter framework to study the random walk of the orbital energy $x$ for an ensemble of test particles on planet-crossing orbits. We show that the evolution of each particle&#x27;s orbital elements $(a, e, i)$ is fully encapsulated by the 3D rotation of the relative velocity vector $\bm{U}_\infty$, whose magnitude remains constant. Consequently, the system can be reduced to two degrees of freedom. By averaging over all possible flyby geometries, we derive explicit expressions for the drift and diffusion coefficients of $x$. We then solve the resulting Fokker--Planck equation to obtain a closed-form solution for the time evolution of the particle distribution. A characteristic scattering timescale naturally emerges, scaling as $(P_{p}/M_{p}^{2})/500$, where $P_{p}$ is the planet&#x27;s orbital period and $M_{p}$ its mass ratio to the central star. The typical ejection speed of small bodies by a planet is estimated to be $3 v_p M_{p}^{1/3}$, where $v_p$ is the planet&#x27;s orbital speed. Our analytical solution constitutes a universal law applicable to both the Solar System and exoplanetary systems, providing a computationally efficient alternative to costly $N$-body simulations for studying the orbital distributions and ejection of planetesimals and planets (e.g., Kuiper Belt, Oort Cloud, debris disks, interstellar objects, and free-floating planets).</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03472v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We develop a kinetic-theory framework to investigate the steady rheology of a dilute gas interacting via a repulsive potential under uniform shear flow. Starting from the Boltzmann equation with a restitution coefficient that depends on the impact velocity and potential strength, we derive evolution equations for the stress tensor based on Grad&#x27;s moment expansion. The resulting expressions for the collisional rates and transport coefficients are fitted with simple analytical functions that capture their temperature dependence over a wide range of shear rates. Comparison with direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) results shows excellent quantitative agreement for the shear stress, temperature anisotropy, and steady viscosity. We also analyze the velocity distribution functions, revealing that the system remains nearly Maxwellian even under strong shear.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.05427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Stellar and planetary magnetic fields play a crucial role in the habitability of a planet and the integrity of its atmosphere. The recently claimed detection of biosignatures, methane, carbon dioxide and dimethyl sulfide/disulfide, in the atmosphere of K2-18 b, a sub-Neptune orbiting an M dwarf star present an intriguing question regarding the stellar magnetic environment and the resistance of the planet&#x27;s magnetosphere (if it exists) to erosion by magnetic activity from the host. To probe for radio emission from the system, we have conducted observations using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at S, C and X-bands (2-4, 4.5-7.5 and 8-10 GHz respectively) to search for coherent and incoherent radio emission. We detect no radio emission associated with incoherent emission mechanisms. We report $3\sigma$ Stokes I upper limits of $49.8\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at S-band, $17.7\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$at C-band and $18.0\ \mu\rm{Jybeam}^{-1}$ at X-band and an upper limit of the ratio of the radio to the total bolometric luminosity of $\log L_\text{R}/\log L_\text{bol}&lt;-8.8$. We have also searched for short duration bursts associated with coherent emission mechanisms at C and X-bands . No signals above a $3\sigma$ significance threshold are detected. Although no signals are detected our radio observations offer constraints, albeit limited, on the stellar magnetic environment supporting recent X-ray observations indicating K2-18 is a very faint emitter. Our results also contextualise any planetary transmission spectra by providing constraints on the activity level of the host.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04105v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Conformable derivatives provide a fractional-looking calculus that remains local and admits a simple representation through classical derivatives with explicit weights. In this paper we develop a systematic operator-theoretic perspective showing that conformable time evolution is, in essence, a classical $C_0$-semigroup observed through a nonlinear clock. We introduce the conformable time map $\psi(t)=t^\alpha/\alpha$ and prove that every $C_0$--$\alpha$-semigroup $\{T_\alpha(t)\}_{t\ge0}$ can be written as $T_\alpha(t)=T(\psi(t))$ for a uniquely determined classical $C_0$-semigroup $\{T(s)\}_{s\ge0}$, with generators agreeing on a common domain. This correspondence yields a one-to-one transfer of mild solutions and shows that orbit-based linear dynamics are invariant under conformable reparametrization. In particular, $\alpha$-hypercyclicity and $\alpha$--chaos coincide with the usual notions for the associated classical semigroup. As a consequence, we obtain a conformable version of the Desch--Schappacher--Webb spectral criterion for chaos. We also place the analysis in the natural functional setting provided by conformable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p,\alpha}$ and their explicit isometric identification with standard $L^p$ spaces, which allows one to transport estimates and spectral arguments without loss. The results clarify which dynamical phenomena in conformable models are genuinely new and which are inherited from classical semigroup dynamics via a nonlinear change of time.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.06439v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We present spatially resolved ALMA observations of the water line at 183 GHz in the disk around the Herbig star HD 100546. The water vapor emission peaks at the inner edge of the warm dust cavity, located ~15 au from the central star. We attribute this to thermal desorption at the water snowline, shifted outward at the dust cavity wall directly heated by the intense radiation. This represents the first spatially resolved image of the water snowline using ALMA observations of the main water isotopologue in a protoplanetary disk. The water emission morphology peaking inside the first dust ring is consistent with previous ALMA detections of oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules in the disk, including thermally desorbed methanol. These findings signal that warm cavities of transition disks provide ideal targets to directly reconstruct the spatial distribution of water vapor and the snowline location with ALMA, and directly connect water vapor emission to ice desorption of complex organic species.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03334v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Scalable hydrogen production using proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers depends on overcoming efficiency losses arising from coupled multiphase, multicomponent transport and interfacial phenomena across the membrane electrode assembly. Here, we demonstrate a multiscale computational framework that combines pore network modeling with finite-element-based reactive transport simulations to accurately and efficiently resolve structure-performance trade-offs in porous transport layers (PTLs). We perform experiments for both commercial single-layer PTLs and microporous layer (MPL)-integrated configurations to benchmark the electrochemical model, achieving excellent agreement between modeling and measurements. We show that in single-layer PTLs, open porous networks facilitate mass transport but incur large voltage penalties from PTL-anode catalyst layer (ACL) contact resistance. Bilayer architectures with dense MPLs reduce these losses by simultaneously improving transport, contact, and structural stability. Finally, in stratified multilayer stacks, combining fine pores near the ACL with highly porous backing layers delivers superior performance at high current densities. Altogether, these results establish mechanistic guidelines for porosity-informed PTL design that minimize interfacial resistance and enable high-efficiency PEMWE operation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03887v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The microscopic and fundamental origin of slide electrification, where droplets of water move across insulating surfaces accumulating and depositing electrical charges, is still debated. Charge transfer is often attributed to ion transfer at the receding contact line. However, it is still unclear whether ion transfer alone can fully account for the observed charge separation. We examined slide electrification of two polar, self-ionizing liquids (water, formamide) and two non-polar liquids (diiodomethane, bromonaphthalene). By cooling below the melting temperature, we were able to compare this process to tribocharging of the respective frozen components. Despite having ions immobilized at sub-freezing temperatures, the ice of the polar liquids continues to accumulate significant charge. Non-polar liquids exhibit lower charging (&lt;25% of polar liquids) and nearly identical charging behaviour in both their liquid and frozen phases on five different substrates. Since non-polar liquids contain few free ions, these observations indicate an alternative charging mechanism, which could be electron transfer. Our findings suggest that slide electrification operates through two mechanisms, with the dominant charge transfer pathway shifting between ions and electron transfer depending on the electronegativity, phase, and temperature.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03935v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Gas-radiation coupling critically influences hypersonic reentry flows, where extreme temperatures induce pronounced non-equilibrium gas and radiative heat transport. Accurate and efficient simulation of radiative gas dynamics is therefore indispensable for reliable design of thermal protection systems for atmospheric entry vehicles. In this study, a Boltzmann-type kinetic model for radiative gas flows is solved across a broad spectrum of flow and radiation transport regimes using the general synthetic iterative scheme (GSIS). The approach integrates an unstructured finite-volume discrete velocity method with a set of macroscopic synthetic equations. Within this framework, the kinetic model provides high-order closures for the constitutive relations in the synthetic equations. Simultaneously, the macroscopic synthetic equations drive the evolution of the mesoscopic kinetic system, significantly accelerating steady-state convergence in near-continuum regimes, as substantiated by linear Fourier stability analysis. Crucially, the algorithm is proven to be asymptotic-preserving, correctly recovering the continuum and optically thick limits, represented by the radiative Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations governing distinct translational, rotational, vibrational, and radiative temperatures, on coarse meshes independent of the mean free path. Numerical simulations of challenging benchmarks, including three-dimensional hypersonic flow over an Apollo reentry capsule, demonstrate that GSIS achieves orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional iterative schemes in multiscale simulations of radiative gas flows while accurately capturing non-equilibrium effects and radiative heat transfer in hypersonic environments.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.04104v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) force fields enable large-scale simulations with near-first-principles accuracy at substantially reduced computational cost. Recent work has extended ML force-field approaches to adiabatic dynamical simulations of condensed-matter lattice models with coupled electronic and structural or magnetic degrees of freedom. However, most existing formulations rely on hand-crafted, symmetry-aware descriptors, whose construction is often system-specific and can hinder generality and transferability across different lattice Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a symmetry-preserving framework based on equivariant neural networks (ENNs) that provides a general, data-driven mapping from local configurations of dynamical variables to the associated on-site forces in a lattice Hamiltonian. In contrast to ENN architectures developed for molecular systems -- where continuous Euclidean symmetries dominate -- our approach aims to embed the discrete point-group and internal symmetries intrinsic to lattice models directly into the neural-network representation of the force field. As a proof of principle, we construct an ENN-based force-field model for the adiabatic dynamics of the Holstein Hamiltonian on a square lattice, a canonical system for electron-lattice physics. The resulting ML-enabled large-scale dynamical simulations faithfully capture mesoscale evolution of the symmetry-breaking phase, illustrating the utility of lattice-equivariant architectures for linking microscopic electronic processes to emergent dynamical behavior in condensed-matter lattice systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03619v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Fitness consequence of dispersal depends on property of the entire landscape, which patches are available and what are the cost of moving. These are information that are not available locally when an organism make the decision to disperse. This poses a problem to the organism, where it is unclear how an adaptive decision can be made. This also poses a problem to the scientist, since in order to study the adaptiveness of dispersal, we need information of the entire landscape. For theorist, this is through making a series of assumption about either the landscape or the organism, and for empiricists, this means a large amount of measurements needs to be made across a large area. In this paper, we propose a link between local demographic process, which an organism can have access to, to the fitness consequence of dispersal. This meant local environmental cue can be used for the decision on dispersal, and hence allow the evolution of plastic dispersal strategy. We will then show that using this approach, evolution of dispersal on complex landscape can be modelled with relative ease, and to show that accidental dispersal in one patch can drive the evolution of adaptive dispersal in another.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03656v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Long-range interactions and electric response are essential for accurate modeling of condensed-phase systems, but capturing them efficiently remains a challenge for atomistic machine learning. Traditionally, these two phenomena can be represented by static charges, that participate in Coulomb interactions between atoms, and dynamic charges such as atomic polar tensors - aka Born effective charges - describing the response to an external electric field. We critically compare different approaches to learn both types of charges, taking bulk water and water clusters as paradigmatic examples: (1) Learning them independently; (2) Coupling static and dynamic charges based on their physical relationship with a single global coupling constant to account for dielectric screening; (3) Coupled learning with a local, environment-dependent screening factor. In the coupled case, correcting for dielectric screening is essential, yet the common assumption of homogeneous, isotropic screening breaks down in heterogeneous systems such as water clusters. A learned, environment-dependent screening restores high accuracy for the dynamical charges. However, the accuracy gain over independent dynamic predictions is negligible, while the computational cost increases compared to using separate models for static and dynamical charges. This suggests that, despite the formal connection between the two charge types, modeling them independently is the more practical choice for both condensed-phase and isolated cluster systems.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Control-theoretic design of amplitude/frequency-modulated impulsive feedback to stabilize periodic dosing cycles in nonlinear plants, demonstrated on closed-loop atracurium administration using patient-specific PK/PD models.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.22417v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The task of maintaining a predefined level of effect in a dynamical plant by applying periodic control actions often arises in e.g. process control and medicine. When the state variables of the plant represent the concentrations of chemical substances and the control action constitutes an instantaneous introduction of a certain quantity of a chemical or drug, this control setup is referred to as a (discrete) dosing problem. The present paper examines an amplitude- and frequency-modulated impulsive controller that, under stationary conditions, generates a desired sequence of uniform and equidistant control impulses based on continuous measurements of the output of a smooth positive nonlinear time-invariant single-input single-output plant with Wiener structure. The controller design method is based on constructing and stabilizing the fixed point of a discrete map that describes the evolution of the state vector of the continuous plant between successive impulsive control action instants. Stability of the fixed point ensures the existence of a basin of attraction along the stationary trajectory, where the solution of a perturbed closed-loop system converges to the stationary solution. The convergence rate is determined by the slopes of the amplitude and frequency modulation functions of the impulsive controller. The proposed controller is applied to the dosing of the drug \emph{atracurium} in closed-loop neuromuscular blockade, and its performance is evaluated on a database of patient-specific pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models estimated from clinical data. It is demonstrated that an implementation of the standard regimen as a pulse-modulated feedback controller significantly minimizes the incidence of underdosing events.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2308.08794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Tipping points are abrupt, drastic, and often irreversible changes in the evolution of non-stationary and chaotic dynamical systems. For instance, increased greenhouse gas concentrations are predicted to lead to drastic decreases in low cloud cover, referred to as a climatological tipping point. In this paper, we learn the evolution of such non-stationary dynamical systems using a novel recurrent neural operator (RNO), which learns mappings between function spaces. After training RNO on only the pre-tipping dynamics, we employ it to detect future tipping points using an uncertainty-based approach. In particular, we propose a conformal prediction framework to forecast tipping points by monitoring deviations from physics constraints (such as conserved quantities and partial differential equations), enabling forecasting of these abrupt changes along with a rigorous measure of uncertainty. We illustrate our proposed methodology on non-stationary ordinary and partial differential equations, such as the Lorenz-63 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations. We also apply our methods to forecast a climate tipping point in stratocumulus cloud cover and airfoil wake and stall transitions using only limited knowledge of the governing equations. For the latter, we show that our proposed method zero-shot generalizes to forecasting multiple future tipping points under varying Reynolds numbers. In our experiments, we demonstrate that even partial or approximate physics constraints can be used to accurately forecast future tipping points.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.03930v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Phage display is a powerful laboratory technique used to study the interactions between proteins and other molecules, whether other proteins, peptides, DNA or RNA. The under-utilisation of this data in conjunction with deep learning models for protein design may be attributed to; high experimental noise levels; the complex nature of data pre-processing; and difficulty interpreting these experimental results. In this work, we propose a novel approach utilising a Bayesian Neural Network within a training loop, in order to simulate the phage display experiment and its associated noise. Our goal is to investigate how understanding the experimental noise and model uncertainty can enable the reliable application of such models to reliably interpret phage display experiments. We validate our approach using actual binding affinity measurements instead of relying solely on proxy values derived from &#x27;held-out&#x27; phage display rounds.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Experimental evolution in a host–parasite microcosm shows that selection at epidemic wave fronts can favor higher infectivity with reduced virulence to enhance spread, illustrating eco-evolutionary feedbacks relevant to general evolutionary dynamics rather than core origins-of-life processes.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Spreading epidemics can foster the rapid emergence of novel parasite variants. Similar to range expansions, parasites at the front of an epidemic wave may evolve traits facilitating their spatial spread. Typically, higher transmissibility and virulence are expected to evolve at the epidemic front, but predictions change if virulence reduces dispersal of infected hosts. We investigated the feedbacks between epidemiology and evolution in interconnected microcosms of the ciliate Paramecium caudatum and its bacterial parasite Holospora undulata. First, two long-term treatments mimicked the moving front of epidemic waves, with and without the natural dispersal of infected hosts. Phenotypic trait assays revealed an eco-to-evo feedback: wave-front parasites (i.e., travelling with infected hosts) were less virulent and interfered less with host dispersal, but also showed higher infectivity, compared to parasites from the control treatment. Whole-genome resequencing corroborated phenotypic divergence, but the genetic targets of selection remain unknown. Second, measurement of the spread of evolved parasites in linear landscapes demonstrated an evo-to-eco feedback: wave-front parasites produced stronger infection outbreaks and faster spreading epidemic waves than did evolution-control parasites. A simulation model assessed the relative importance of the different parasite traits in determining infectious spread over a broad parameter range. It suggests that, if dispersal is generally low, higher infectivity alone can produce the observed differences in epidemic spread speed. Our study illustrates how the need to travel with the host shapes eco-evolutionary feedbacks at parasite invasion fronts, and it highlights the importance of considering concomitant evolutionary change when predicting epidemic speed.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Antifolate resistance in P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase remains a major challenge for malaria control. To understand how this enzyme preserves function under antifolate selection, we developed PfPATH, a computational framework that integrates mutational fitness measurements, evolutionary interactions, and structural information to map plausible adaptive trajectories. PfPATH adaptive walks reveal that only a small subset of residues forms a constrained adaptive ridge that guides evolution. Most resistance mutations are harmful on their own and only become viable when supported by stabilizing changes. Hence, adaptation is confined to a few constrained pathways yielding high resistance. Structural network analyses indicate that these resistance mutations do not disrupt the overall enzyme architecture. Instead, they reorganize internal communication in a way that preserves catalytic function. We further showed through molecular dynamics and free-energy analyses that resistant variants remain structurally stable while exploring broader low-energy conformational substates. In conclusion, our work reveals a narrow and predictable route to antifolate escape, with implications for anticipating resistance evolution and guiding future drug design.</p>

Patterson Intermittency and clogging statistics have been extensively investigated in a variety of systems – from granular materials to pedestrian evacuations. Here, the authors experimentally study the evolution of mechanical pressure in a two-dimensional system of self-propelled agents flowing through a bottleneck, revealing a strong correlation between pressure dynamics and the system state (clogged vs unclogged). #ClearMotivation #SoftMatterSpotlight [Phys.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> A perspective piece arguing that long-term human–Mycobacterium tuberculosis co-evolution produces multiple immunological pathways to disease, and that systems-biology tools (e.g., single-cell/spatial transcriptomics) must model this complexity rather than seek a single mechanism.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tuberculosis is once again the most fatal global infectious disease and has killed many more humans than any other pathogen. Despite the identification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) over 140 years ago, we have yet to control the epidemic. A central issue is the complexity of the host–pathogen interaction, with multiple underlying pathways leading to tuberculosis disease. This intricate relationship stems from the prolonged co-evolution of the pathogen with humans, resulting in diverse immunological processes leading to tuberculosis disease. Conversely, Mtb exposure may give a survival advantage through innate immune training, thereby providing selective pressure over millennia. Emerging methodologies, such as single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, offer a golden opportunity to understand the immunology unpinning this host–pathogen interaction at unprecedented resolution. However, these analyses will be fundamentally flawed if they do not consider the intricacies of human Mtb infection. Here, we propose that attempts to find single immunological mechanisms leading to tuberculosis are hindering progress, and we must embrace the complexity of multiple paths to disease to allow the systems biology era to deliver transformative solutions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces and benchmarks a machine-learning perturbation model (RAZOR) for charged Pt(111)–water interfaces, focusing on avoiding dielectric breakdown artifacts to accurately reproduce ab initio interfacial water structure and potential response under modest bias.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The recently introduced &quot;Response analysis in z-orientation&quot; (RAZOR) model utilizes perturbation theory to machine learn the energy and force response to applied bias charges in atomistic simulations of electrified interfaces. While we have shown that RAZOR successfully reproduces ab initio results for adsorbates on metallic surfaces in an implicit solvent environment, real electrochemical applications require the inclusion of at least a few explicit H2O layers of the electrolyte. Here, we benchmark RAZOR&#x27;s performance in the description of the Pt(111)-H2O interface. We show that RAZOR can reliably reproduce ab initio molecular dynamics findings for bias-induced changes in H2O density and orientation profiles as well as changes in the potential. To do so, a specific training procedure needs to be applied which avoids the erroneous learning of artifacts from the dielectric breakdown of interfacial water and the accompanying charge transfer into the H2O layers. Ultimately, we are confident that RAZOR can provide quantitative predictions in a +/- 20 muC/cm2 window around the neutral-charged cell, which is sufficient for many pressing electrochemical questions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Describes a window-free in-situ soft X-ray XPS/NEXAFS electrode assembly that enables real-time electronic/chemical characterization of hydrated electrocatalytic interfaces during water oxidation, a broadly useful method but not directly focused on origins-of-life chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In-situ soft X-ray spectroscopy provides direct insight into the electronic structure of electrocatalysts under realistic reaction conditions but remains technically challenging due to the need to combine aqueous electrochemistry with ultra-high-vacuum detection. Here we present a mesoporous carbon–membrane working electrode assembly (WEA) that enables window-free in-situ XPS and NEXAFS measurements during electrochemical reactions. The design integrates a Nafion™ proton-exchange membrane with a mesoporous carbon–ionomer contact layer and a thin IrOₓ catalyst layer, providing continuous electronic and protonic pathways and stable hydration through the membrane. By tuning the chamber water vapor pressure to 8 mbar, the WEA maintains a nanometer-thin water layer sufficient for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) while preserving photoelectron detection efficiency. A robust peristaltic pumping system and closed-loop alumina-bed water vapor dosing maintain steady-state hydration at 6–10 mbar with &lt;±0.1 mbar variation, enabling reproducible in-siut spectra over extended periods. In-situ Ir 4f and O 1s XPS reveal reversible oxidation of Ir³⁺/Ir⁴⁺ to Ir⁴⁺/Ir⁵⁺ and dynamic changes in hydroxyl and lattice oxygen species, while O K-edge NEXAFS identify the formation of μ₂–O and μ₁–O species at OER potential, corresponding to OER-active intermediates. The WEA thus provides a quantitative, window-free platform for probing electrochemical interfaces under near-ambient conditions and establishes a general methodology for in-situ soft X-ray studies of functional electrocatalysts, closely resembling the architecture and operation of industrial membrane-based water electrolysers. This approach establishes a reliable methodology for coupling electrochemistry with the element specific soft X-ray spectroscopy under realistic reaction conditions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> LORA is a Snakemake-based, reproducible long-read genome assembly pipeline integrating multiple assemblers and QC/reporting steps for bacterial and unicellular eukaryote datasets, offering general genomics utility but minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Genome assembly from long-read sequencing data has become a standard approach for resolving complex genomic regions and producing high-contiguity assemblies. However, the diversity of available assemblers, their varying performance across species, and the need for reproducible workflows present ongoing challenges. We developed LORA, an easy-to-use and reproducible application for assembling genomes from long-read data. LORA integrates several well-established assemblers, including Canu, HiFiasm, Flye, and Unicycler, as well as more recent tools such as Necat and Pecat. It is implemented as a Snakemake pipeline to parallelize tasks and support seamless execution on both local machines and computing clusters. LORA includes multiple quality assessment steps, interactive HTML reports for interpretation, BLAST-based taxonomic identification, and completeness evaluation. Together, these features provide users with a comprehensive view of assembly quality and potential problematic. We illustrate the capabilities of LORA using datasets from bacterial genomes and unicellular eukaryotes, sequenced with both PacBio and Oxford Nanopore technologies, highlighting typical outcomes and common pitfalls encountered during long-read assemblies. LORA is distributed as part of the Sequana project, an open-source framework designed for reproducibility, maintainability, and straightforward deployment across computing environments.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Operando X-ray diffraction reveals how oxygen-loss-driven surface reconstruction in Ni-rich layered oxide cathodes promotes heterogeneous bulk delithiation and accelerates capacity fade during high-voltage cycling.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The electrochemical performance of single-crystalline Ni-rich layered oxide cathodes is fundamentally limited by bulk Li⁺ diffusion within micrometre-sized particles. During high-voltage cycling—necessary for high-energy applications—intraparticle Li⁺ diffusion is further impeded by oxygen-loss-induced surface reconstruction from the layered phase to spinel/rock-salt structures. Therefore, to fully understand how bulk Li⁺ transport kinetics influences electrochemical degradation, it is necessary to establish the correlation between surface reconstruction and bulk delithiation during the anisotropic structural evolution (i.e., expansion of the layers followed by their contraction) of the cathode particles during long-term cycling. In this work, we accomplish this using multi-rate operando X-ray diffraction studies of single-crystalline Ni-rich layered oxide cathodes aged under different voltage windows in single-layer pouch full cells. We quantify how increased surface reconstruction leads to greater heterogeneity in bulk delithiation, thereby promoting phase separation and exacerbating electrochemical capacity fade. These results provide a direct mechanistic link between surface degradation and bulk delithiation in such cathodes and offer a framework for non-destructively probing kinetics-dependent degradation under practically relevant conditions to guide strategies for improved cycling stability.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Myeloid leukemias, diseases marked by aggressiveness and poor outcomes, are frequently triggered by oncogenic translocations. In the case of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), the BCR-ABL fusion initiates chronic phase disease with second hits allowing progression to blast crisis. Although Gleevec has been transformative for CML, blast crisis CML remains relatively drug resistant. Here, we show that MSI2-HOXA9 , a translocation with an unknown role in cancer, can serve as a second hit in driving bcCML. Compared to BCR-ABL, BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 led to a more aggressive disease in vivo with decreased latency, increased lethality, and a differentiation blockade that is a hallmark of blast crisis. Domain mapping revealed that the MSI2 RNA binding domain RRM1 had a preferential impact on growth and lethality of bcCML relative to RRM2 or the HOXA9 domain. Mechanistically, MSI2-HOXA9 triggered global downstream changes with a preferential upregulation of mitochondrial components. Consistent with this, BCR-ABL/MSI2-HOXA9 cells exhibited a significant increase in mitochondrial respiration. These data suggest that MSI2-HOXA9 acts, at least in part, by increasing expression of the mitochondrial polymerase POLRMT and augmenting mitochondrial function and basal respiration in blast crisis. Collectively, our findings demonstrate for the first time that translocations involving the stem and developmental signal MSI2 can be oncogenic and suggest that MSI, which we found to be a frequent partner for an array of translocations, could also be a driver mutation across solid cancers.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Using single-cell and bulk transcriptomics, the study links intrinsic replication stress in luminal progenitors to ELF3 upregulation that mitigates genomic instability while promoting transformation in BRCA1-deficient breast tumorigenesis.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> BRCA1 is a critical tumor suppressor, mutations in which greatly increase risks for many tumors in carriers, most notably breast cancer. Luminal progenitor cells (LPs) are the currently recognized cells of origin of BRCA1-deficient breast cancers. However, the reason why LPs are prone to transform with BRCA1 deficiency has not been elucidated. Here, using single-cell sequencing of human BRCA1 mutant breast cancers and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of BRCA1 -deficient normal mammary cells, we reveal that replication stress is a feature of LPs and a driving factor during BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis. Mechanistically, replication stress and BRCA1 deficiency lead to significant upregulation of ELF3 expression. ELF3 can help suppress excessive genomic instability and promote LP transformation with BRCA1 deficiency. Moreover, ELF3 emerged as a core transcription factor regulating LP genes, leading to LP expansion. Our findings suggest that replication stress is a driving factor during BRCA1-associated tumorigenesis in luminal progenitor cells and elucidates the key role of ELF3 during this process.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Materials-chemistry preprint showing highly efficient chirality transfer from Δ/Λ metal complexes into nematic liquid crystals, offering a potential model system for studying chiral amplification and ordered-phase effects relevant (indirectly) to prebiotic homochirality.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nematic (N) liquid crystals (LCs), characterized by one-dimensional orientational order, readily transform into chiral nematic (N*) phases upon the incorporation of optically active substances, known as chiral dopants. While the ease of N* induction has driven the extensive development of organic chiral dopants, coordination compounds possessing Δ/Λ chirality have emerged as compelling alternatives, offering distinct structural and functional attributes. A defining feature of these &quot;metallodopants&quot; is their exceptionally high helical twisting power (HTP). For instance, early studies demonstrated that the simple complex Λ-[Ru(acac)3] exhibits a remarkably high HTP of 90 micrometer-1 in MBBA (N-(4-methoxybenzylidene)-4-butylaniline). This efficiency is attributed to the rigid coordination framework, which facilitates robust chirality transfer to the host LC. However, metallodopants often face challenges regarding miscibility with nematic hosts and intrinsic coloration, potentially complicating their integration into optical devices; consequently, systematic investigations have been limited compared to organic dopants. Nevertheless, metallodopants offer unique advantages. In tris(chelate) metal complexes, the sense of the induced helix (P or M) is strongly correlated with ligand orientation; for example, a 90° rotation of a ligand’s elongation axis can reverse the helical sense. This predictable inversion, supported by theoretical models, underscores the critical role of structural rigidity. Furthermore, the intrinsic absorption of these complexes, once viewed as a drawback, is now being harnessed for resonance Raman enhancement and chiroptical modulation. By combining high HTPs, predictable helix inversion, and spectroscopic utility, coordination compounds are positioning themselves as versatile competitors to organic dopants, serving as both functional inducers and optical probes for next-generation photonic and sensing technologies.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a DMS-MaPseq-based framework to quantify RNA hairpin structure and in-cell protein occupancy at single-nucleotide resolution, enabling effective affinity/occupancy estimates that predict functional outcomes (RNA decay) in human cells.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> RNA structures that form inside living cells influence processes ranging from translation to RNA decay, many of which are controlled by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Because RBP specificity depends on both local RNA structure and sequence motifs, traditional pulldown-based methods often obscure the structural context of bound RNAs. Here, a quantitative framework based on dimethyl sulfate mutational profiling and sequencing (DMS-MaPseq) is introduced that jointly measures RNA structure and protein binding at single-nucleotide resolution in human cells, enabling estimation of effective RNA-protein affinities and fractional occupancy directly in cells. Application of this approach to a 1,600-member library of MS2 hairpin mutants reveals that RNA folding is the strongest determinant of MS2 coat protein (MCP) recognition, and that stable MS2 structures must form for MCP to bind its target sequence. MCP also shows strong preference for its consensus loop sequence while displaying minimal dependence on stem length beyond ten base pairs or on stem GC content. Incorporation of an inducible degron fused to MCP allows precise tuning of intracellular protein concentrations analogous to those of many endogenous RBPs and show that DMS reactivity changes can be used to infer binding specificities across a subsaturating regime. A quantitative occupancy framework further shows that inferred fraction-bound values accurately predict how efficiently MCP fused to a downregulatory-domain drives RNA degradation. Together, these results establish a generalizable approach for measuring RBP-RNA affinities with structural resolution in living cells, dissecting how sequence and structure contribute to RBP recognition, and quantitatively linking occupancy to functional output.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study shows that piRNA/PIWI signaling in the ciliate Oxytricha guides N6-adenine DNA methylation (6mA) via MTA1 to mark and protect genomic regions from programmed deletion during nuclear development, illustrating an RNA-directed epigenetic mechanism for genome maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The ciliate Oxytricha undergoes massive genome rearrangements during development to produce a functional nucleus from an encrypted zygotic genome. PIWI-interacting small RNAs protect DNA regions against deletion, but how that protective mark is established has been a mystery. Recently our lab discovered MTA1, a methyltransferase that catalyzes DNA N6-adenine (6mA) methylation. Both MTA1 and the Oxytricha Piwi protein, Otiwi1, are required for development, and Otiwi1 mutation eliminates 6mA signal. To examine the role of 6mA, we analyzed its genome-wide distribution across development in wild-type and MTA1 mutant backcrossed cells. We find specific and abundant enrichment on retained sequences, suggesting a protective role for this epigenetic mark. Furthermore, programmed retention of a DNA region that is normally deleted leads to accumulation of new 6mA marks on the ectopically retained DNA sequence. Together, these results suggest that piRNA-guided 6mA DNA methylation leads to protection of DNA sequences against deletion during nuclear differentiation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> To evaluate the impact of wildfire on drinking water treatability, wildfire ash is often added to source water to reflect post-fire source water quality change. The use of varying experimental conditions has led to conflicting inferences across studies and inconsistent results, even between nominal replicates. Here, mixing time and ash concentration effects on wildfire ash-impacted water (WAIW) quality were investigated, and their impacts on leached water extractable organic matter (WEOM) from wildfire and prescribed fire ash were characterized at bench-scale. The effects of mixing time and ash-to-water ratios were investigated using both natural river water and ultrapure water. Notably, WEOM concentration and character varied considerably within the first 24 hours of mixing, and water type and ash mass concentration limit the leaching of WEOM into water. These results highlight the critical role of careful experimental design and well-justified approaches to support meaningful interpretation and comparability across studies.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Materials/electrocatalysis study demonstrating size-controlled hydrothermal synthesis of high-entropy spinel oxide nanoparticles that boost oxygen-evolution (water-splitting) performance, with only indirect relevance to Origins of Life via general redox/energy catalysis contexts.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> High-entropy oxides offer a promising platform for oxygen evolution reaction catalysis owing to their entropy-stabilized structures and flexible design of cation metal elements. However, conventional high-temperature synthesis leads to extensive particle growth and limits access to nanoscale particles with higher density of catalytic sites. Here, a subcritical hydrothermal synthesis combined with catechol-assisted growth regulation is introduced to produce high-entropy single-phase spinel oxide nanoparticles with controlled crystallite sizes down to the single-nanometer scale. The resulting reduction in particle size markedly enhances the oxygen evolution activity. A linear dependence of the oxygen evolution current density on the inverse crystallite size highlights the critical role of nanoscale structures in accelerating catalytic reactions. In-situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals electronic and structural robustness of all constituent metal elements under OER conditions, with negligible shifts in oxidation state or changes in local coordination structure, which is distinct from the pronounced reconstruction typically observed in conventional oxide catalysts. When deployed in a membrane electrode assembly, our synthesized high-entropy oxide catalysts with the smallest particle size deliver 2.0 A cm-2 at 1.96 V, demonstrating practical relevance for high-current-density electrolysis. This work establishes low-temperature hydrothermal synthesis with organic molecular regulation as a powerful and scalable route to engineer highly crystalline, compositionally homogeneous high-entropy oxide nanoparticles, offering design guidelines for next-generation oxygen evolution reaction catalysts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> To evaluate the impact of wildfire on drinking water treatability, wildfire ash is often added to source water to reflect post-fire source water quality change. The use of varying experimental conditions has led to conflicting inferences across studies and inconsistent results, even between nominal replicates. Here, mixing time and ash concentration effects on wildfire ash-impacted water (WAIW) quality were investigated, and their impacts on leached water extractable organic matter (WEOM) from wildfire and prescribed fire ash were characterized at bench-scale. The effects of mixing time and ash-to-water ratios were investigated using both natural river water and ultrapure water. Notably, WEOM concentration and character varied considerably within the first 24 hours of mixing, and water type and ash mass concentration limit the leaching of WEOM into water. These results highlight the critical role of careful experimental design and well-justified approaches to support meaningful interpretation and comparability across studies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2510.20046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Solvable bosonic models provide a fundamental framework for describing light propagation in nonlinear media, including optical down-conversion processes that generate squeezed states of light and their higher-order generalizations. In quantum optics a central objective is to determine the time evolution of a given initial state. Exact analytic solution to the state-evolution problem is presented, applicable to a broad class of solvable bosonic models and arbitrary initial states. Moreover, the characteristic equation governing the energy spectrum is derived and the eigenstates are found in the form of continued fractions and as the principal minors of the associated Jacobi matrix. The results provide a solid analytical framework for discussion of exactly solvable bosonic models.</p>

In a recent article, the first two authors of the present paper introduced partially cosymplectic structures as a geometric framework for thermodynamic systems, recovering the evolution equations obtained variationally.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Pixel-resolved modeling shows disc-averaged stellar contamination corrections can break down (especially at optical wavelengths and for non-equatorial transits), implying that robust interpretation of high-precision exoplanet transmission spectra—and thus any future biosignature-relevant inferences—requires geometry- and limb-darkening-aware stellar heterogeneity treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02621v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Stellar photospheric heterogeneities (e.g., starspots, faculae) distort the stellar spectrum in transit and imprint wavelength-dependent biases on the planet-to-star radius ratio (Transit Light Source Effect, TLSE). The Rackham-TLSE (R-TLSE) prescription applies a disc-averaged correction based solely on filling factor and spectral contrast, but transmission spectroscopy also depends on limb darkening, active-region distribution, and transit geometry. We include these in a pixel-resolved framework, ECLIPSE-Xlambda, and run idealised noise-free model-model comparisons to R-TLSE. For LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, and WASP-69 b, disc-averaged corrections differ from the pixel model by up to about 400 ppm in the optical for active hosts and non-equatorial transits, but stay below about 10 ppm in the near-infrared where limb darkening is weak. We then apply both approaches to the JWST/NIRISS SOSS spectrum of LHS 1140 b. With limb darkening set to zero, ECLIPSE-Xlambda recovers stellar-contamination parameters matching the reference R-TLSE solution, confirming consistency in the disc-averaged limit. With wavelength-dependent limb darkening, reproducing the short-wavelength slope via stellar contamination alone requires hot faculae (delta Tfac about 600 K; ffac about 0.35), equivalent to a circular facular region of radius about 0.6 Rstar (about 60% of the stellar radius) on the disc; such an extended unocculted region is physically unlikely even for an active M dwarf. Purely stellar contamination would therefore require extreme faculae, whereas a genuine atmospheric contribution complementing a more modest facular signal is more plausible. These results delineate the validity regime of R-TLSE and underscore the need for geometry-aware stellar-heterogeneity models including limb darkening in high-precision transmission spectroscopy.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02548v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The rise of oxygen in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere during the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) occurred about 2.3 billion years ago. There is considerably greater uncertainty for the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis, but it likely occurred significantly earlier, perhaps by 700 million years. Assuming this time lag is proportional to the rate of oxygen generation, we can estimate how long it would take for a GOE-like event to occur on a hypothetical Earth-analog planet orbiting the star TRAPPIST-1 (a late M star with Teff 2560 K). Although in the habitable zone, an Earth-analog planet located in TRAPPIST-1e&#x27;s orbit would receive only 0.9% of the Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) that the Earth gets from the Sun. This is because most of the star&#x27;s light is emitted at wavelengths longer than the 400-700 nm PAR range. Thus it would take 63 Gyrs for a GOE to occur. But the linear assumption is problematic; as light levels increase, photosynthesis saturates then declines, an effect known as photoinhibition. Photoinhibition varies from species to species and depends on a host of environmental factors. There is also sensitivity to the upper wavelength limit of the PAR: extending just 50 nm increases the number of photons by a factor of 2.5. Including these and other factors greatly reduces the timescale to roughly 1-5 Gyrs for a GOE. However, non-oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria can thrive in low-light environments and can use near-IR light out to 1100 nm, providing 22 times as many photons. With this huge light advantage, and because they evolved earlier, anoxygenic photosynthesizers would likely dominate the ecosystem. On a late M-star Earth-analog planet, oxygen may never reach significant levels in the atmosphere and a GOE may never occur, let alone a Cambrian Explosion. Thus complex animal life is unlikely.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02545v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Pebble drift is an important mechanism for supplying the materials needed to build planets in the inner region of protoplanetary disks. Thus, constraining pebble drift&#x27;s timescales and mass flux is essential to understanding planet formation history. Current pebble drift models suggest pebble fluxes can be constrained from the enhancement of gaseous volatile abundances when icy pebbles sublimate after drifting across key snowlines. In this work, we present ALMA observations of spatially resolved $^{13}$C$^{18}$O J=2-1 line emission inside the midplane CO snowline of the HD 163296 and MWC 480 protoplanetary disks. We use radiative transfer and thermochemical models to constrain the spatial distribution of CO gas column density. We find that both disks display centrally peaked CO abundance enhancement of up to ten times of ISM abundance levels. For HD 163296 and MWC 480, the inferred enhancements require 250-350 and 480-660 Earth Masses of pebbles to have drifted across their CO snowlines, respectively. These ranges fall within cumulative pebble mass flux ranges to grow gas giants in the interior to the CO snowline. The centrally peaked CO enhancement is unexpected in current pebble drift models, which predict CO enhancement peaks at the CO snowline or is uniform inside the snowline. We propose two hypotheses to explain the centrally-peaked CO enhancement, including a large CO desorption distance and CO trapped in water ice. By testing both hypotheses with the 1D gas and dust evolution code chemcomp, we find that volatile trapping (about 30\%) best reproduces the centrally peaked CO enhancement observed.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02556v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The Lazuli Space Observatory is a 3-meter aperture astronomical facility designed for rapid-response observations and precision astrophysics across visible to near-infrared wavelengths (400-1700 nm bandpass). An off-axis, freeform telescope delivers diffraction-limited image quality (Strehl $&gt;$0.8 at 633 nm) to three instruments across a wide, flat focal plane. The three instruments provide complementary capabilities: a Wide-field Context Camera (WCC) delivers multi-band imaging over a 35&#x27; $\times$ 12&#x27; footprint with high-cadence photometry; an Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) provides continuous 400-1700 nm spectroscopy at R $\sim$ 100-500 for stable spectrophotometry; and an ExtraSolar Coronagraph (ESC) enables high-contrast imaging expected to reach raw contrasts of $10^{-8}$ and post-processed contrasts approaching $10^{-9}$. Operating from a 3:1 lunar-resonant orbit, Lazuli will respond to targets of opportunity in under four hours--a programmatic requirement designed to enable routine temporal responsiveness that is unprecedented for a space telescope of this size. Lazuli&#x27;s technical capabilities are shaped around three broad science areas: (1) time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, (2) stars and planets, and (3) cosmology. These capabilities enable a potent mix of science spanning gravitational wave counterpart characterization, fast-evolving transients, Type Ia supernova cosmology, high-contrast exoplanet imaging, and spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres. While these areas guide the observatory design, Lazuli is conceived as a general-purpose facility capable of supporting a wide range of astrophysical investigations, with open time for the global community. We describe the observatory architecture and capabilities in the preliminary design phase, with science operations anticipated following a rapid development cycle from concept to launch.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02665v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We report the discovery of a sub-Neptune and a Neptune-like planet ($R_b = 2.48^{+0.14}_{-0.10}\,R_\oplus$, $R_c = 4.03^{+0.23}_{-0.15}\,R_\oplus$) orbiting the F-type star TOI-4495. The planets have orbital periods of 2.567 days and 5.185 days, lying close to a 2:1 mean-motion resonance (MMR). Our photodynamical analysis of the TESS light curves constrains the planetary masses to $M_b = 7.7 \pm 1.4\,M_\oplus$ and $M_c = 23.2 \pm 4.7\,M_\oplus$. The measured masses and radii indicate the presence of volatile-rich gaseous envelopes on both planets. The Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and the Doppler shadow of TOI-4495 c reveal a well-aligned orbit with a projected stellar obliquity of $\lambda = -2.3^{+8.3}_{-7.8}\,\mathrm{deg}$. Combined with the low mutual inclination constrained by the photodynamical analysis ($\Delta I &lt; 8.7\,\mathrm{deg}$), the planetary orbits are likely coplanar and aligned with the host star&#x27;s spin axis. We show that the planets are near, but not in, the 2:1 MMR, with a circulating resonant angle. We also find substantial free eccentricity for the inner planet, TOI-4495 b ($e_b = 0.078^{+0.020}_{-0.013}$). Given the observed proximity to the 2:1 resonance and the more massive outer planet, TOI-4495 b and c are particularly susceptible to resonant overstability, which can convert resonantly excited eccentricity into free eccentricity. However, additional mechanisms (e.g., planetesimal scattering) may be required to further excite the eccentricity by $\sim 4\%$. To prevent tidal damping from reducing the eccentricity below the observed level over the star&#x27;s lifetime (1.9 Gyr), the reduced tidal quality factor of TOI-4495 b must be $Q&#x27; \gtrsim 10^5$, consistent with the presence of a thick envelope on the planet.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02479v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Planet formation is inherently linked to protoplanetary disc evolution, which recent developments suggest is driven by magnetised winds rather than turbulent viscosity. We study planet formation in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind-driven discs, assuming accretion occurs in a laminar surface layer above a weakly turbulent midplane. Our goal is to assess the global consequences of recent hydrodynamical results, including inefficient midplane heating and the existence of two Type II migration regimes: slow viscosity-dominated and fast wind-driven migration. We perform single-embryo planetary population syntheses with varying initial disc conditions (i.e. disc mass, size and angular momentum transport), and embryo starting locations, testing different prescriptions for the accretion layer thickness $\Sigma_\text{active}$. Thin ($\lesssim0.01\mathrm{g\,cm^{-2}}$) or fast ($\gtrsim12\%$ sonic velocity) accretion layers result in slow, viscosity-dominated regime which strongly limits the extent of Type II migration. For thick ($\gtrsim1\mathrm{g\,cm^{-2}}$) or slow ($\lesssim3\%$ sonic velocity) accretion layers, fast wind-driven Type II migration occurs frequently, leading to long-range inward migration that sets in once planets reach masses sufficient to block the accreting layer. Disk-limited gas accretion is also strongly affected by deep and early gap opening, limiting maximum giant planet masses. These effects strongly influence the final mass-distance distribution. For thin layers, giant planets form nearly in situ once they have entered Type II migration, which happens already at a few Earth masses, while thick layers lead to numerous migrated Hot Jupiters. Overall, we find that while the global properties of the emerging planet population are strongly modified relative to classical viscous discs, key properties of the observed population can be reproduced within this new paradigm.</p>

Both the C17O/13C18O(2-1) and C18O/C17O(1-0) flux ratios rise sharply across the CO snowline and flatten beyond 1.5 arcsec (r &gt;= 150 au), where the emission becomes optically thin. This transition, reflecting a steep drop in CO column density set by the disk&#x27;s thermal structure, makes HD 163296 an optimal case for isotopic analysis. Using beam-averaged intensities of the four transitions measured in this optically thin region, we derive isotopic ratios of 12C/13C = 75.3 (+14.7/-11.4) and 18O/17O = 3.28 (+0.31/-0.26), both consistent with local interstellar medium values. The 16O/18O ratio remains weakly constrained due to moderate optical depth in the C18O(1-0) line and degeneracy with CO column density. These results demonstrate that rare CO isotopologues can provide robust, empirical constraints on isotopic ratios in disks when sharp structural transitions allow for the identification of optically thin regions, and establish HD 163296 as a benchmark for extending such studies to other systems with resolved snowline structures.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2505.08863v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Debris disks are exoplanetary systems that contain planets, minor bodies (i.e., asteroids, Kuiper belt objects, comets, etc.), and micron-sized debris dust. Since water ice is the most common frozen volatile, it plays an essential role in the formation of planets and minor bodies. Although water ice has been commonly found in Kuiper belt objects and comets in the Solar System, no definitive evidence for water ice in debris disks has been obtained to date. Here, we report the discovery of water ice in the HD 181327 disk using the James Webb Space Telescope Near-Infrared Spectrograph. We detect the solid-state broad absorption feature of water ice at 3 $\mu$m and a distinct Fresnel peak feature at 3.1 $\mu$m, a characteristic of large water-ice particles. This implies the presence of a water-ice reservoir in the HD 181327 exoKuiper belt. Gradients of water-ice features at different stellocentric distances reveal a dynamic process of destroying and replenishing water ice in the disk, with estimated water-ice mass fractions ranging from 0.1% at ~85 au to 14% at ~113 au. It is highly plausible that the icy bodies that release water ice in HD 181327 could be the extra-solar counterparts of some of the Kuiper belt objects in our Solar System, supported by their spectral similarity.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02486v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This manuscript investigates the impact of key dust evolution parameters on dust retention and trapping in protoplanetary discs. Using models with and without pressure bumps, combined with radiative transfer simulations, images of the dust continuum emission at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths, their fluxes and observed disc sizes are presented. For discs without pressure bumps (smooth discs), significant dust mass can only be retained over Myr timescales when dust fragmentation velocities are low (1m/s) and with viscosity values of $\alpha=10^{-3}$. For such a combination of fragmentation velocity and viscosity, the synthetic images show a bright inner emission follow by a shallow emission with potential gaps if they are present in the gas profile as well. At higher fragmentation velocities (5-10m/s), most dust is lost due to radial drift at million-year timescales unless pressure traps are present, in which case dust masses can increase by orders of magnitude and structures are observed in synthetic images. The viscosity parameter strongly shapes observable features, with low $\alpha$ producing sharper, potentially asymmetric inner wall cavities in inclined discs due to optically thick emission. High $\alpha$ favors the appearance of shoulders around the predominant rings that dust trapping produces. However, distinguishing between different fragmentation velocities observationally remains challenging. The inferred dust disc sizes from synthetic observations do not always correspond directly to dust model sizes or to the location of pressure bumps. Finally, we discuss implications for pebble fluxes and the delivery of volatiles to the inner disc. These results emphasize the strong degeneracies among dust evolution parameters and highlight the need for multi-wavelength, high-resolution observations to disentangle the processes shaping the formation of planets in protoplanetary discs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02407v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Standard simulations of the Iterated Prisoners Dilemma (IPD) operate in deterministic, noise-free environments, producing strategies that may be theoretically optimal but fragile when confronted with real-world uncertainty. This paper addresses two critical gaps in evolutionary game theory research: (1) the absence of realistic environmental stressors during strategy evolution, and (2) the Interpretability Gap, where evolved genetic strategies remain opaque binary sequences devoid of semantic meaning. We introduce a novel framework combining stochastic environmental perturbations (God Mode) with Large Language Model (LLM)-based behavioral profiling to transform evolved genotypes into interpretable character archetypes. Our experiments demonstrate that strategies evolved under chaotic conditions exhibit superior resilience and present distinct behavioral phenotypes, ranging from Ruthless Capitalists to Diplomatic Enforcers. These phenotypes are readily classified by LLMs but remain nearly impossible to interpret through manual genome inspection alone. This work bridges evolutionary computation with explainable AI and provides a template for automated agent characterization in multi-agent systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2506.22537v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: The increasing number of detailed exoplanet observations offers an opportunity to refine our analyses and interpretations. Here, we show that atmospheres that appear volatile-rich and/or cloudy may instead be helium-rich. As transmission spectra constrain the atmospheric scale height ($H$), a He-enriched atmosphere can be misinterpreted as H$_2$-dominated water-rich to bring the mean molecular weight ($\mu$) to intermediate values ($\sim$4$-$10) when He/H$_2$ is fixed. Similarly, a cloud deck can reduce the spectral features, and thus the apparent (i.e., cloud-free equivalent) $H$. We present a proof-of-concept reanalysis of HD~209458~b&#x27;s JWST transmission spectrum treating He/H$_2$ as a free parameter, resulting in sets of He-rich solutions. We argue that He enhancement must be considered to reliably constrain atmospheric composition, be sensitive to a more diverse planetary population, and ultimately yield robust trends to inform formation and evolution pathways. Looking ahead, we suggest leveraging insights from differences in pressure-broadening effects, outflow measurements, and atmospheric chemistry to disentangle reliably between He-, volatile-rich, and cloudy atmospheres -- while recognizing that associated models need targeted upgrades to reach the fidelity level required to this end.</p>

We show that all these features can emerge from a minimal athermal two-dimensional model where particles interact isotropically by a double-well potential, which includes an excluded volume and a maximum coordination number. The rich variety of structural patterns shown by this simple geometrical model apply to a wide range of real systems including water, silicon, and different amorphous materials.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02539v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: While fluids near a solid surface are at the core of applications in energy storage/conversion, electrochemistry/electrowetting and adsorption/catalysis, their nanoscale behavior remains only partially deciphered. Beyond conventional effects (e.g. adsorption/reaction, interfacial transport, phase transition shifts), recent experimental and theoretical studies on metallic surfaces have unraveled exotic peculiarities such as complex electrostatic screening, unexpected wetting transition, and interfacial quantum friction. These novel features require developing and embarking new tools to tackle the coupling between charge relaxation in the metal and molecular behavior in the vicinal fluid. Here, using the concept of Virtual Thomas-Fermi fluids, we employ a molecular simulation approach to investigate interfacial transport of fluid molecules and metal charge carriers at their interface--including the underlying electrostatically-driven dynamic friction and the coupling between charge current/hydrodynamic flow (the so-called electrohydrodynamic drag). While conventional numerical techniques consider either insulating materials or metallic materials described as polarizable, non-conducting media, our atom-scale strategy provides an effective yet realistic description of the solid excitation spectrum--including charge relaxation modes and conductivity. By applying this approach to water near metallic surfaces of various electrostatic screening lengths, we unveil a non-monotonous dependence of the fluid/solid friction on the metallicity with a maximum occurring as the charge dynamic structure factors of the solid and fluid strongly overlap. Moreover, we report a direct observation of the electrohydrodynamic drag which arises from the momentum transfer between the solid and liquid through dynamic electrostatic interactions and the underlying interfacial friction.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02699v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Heat dissipation is ubiquitous in living systems, which constantly convert distinct forms of energy into each other. The transport of thermal energy in liquids and even within proteins is well understood but kinetic energy transfer across a heterogeneous molecular boundary provides additional challenges. Here, we use atomistic molecular dynamics simulations under steady-state conditions to analyze how a protein dissipates surplus thermal energy into the surrounding solvent. We specifically focus on collective degrees of freedom that govern the dynamics of the system from the diffusive regime to mid-infrared frequencies. Using a fully anharmonic analysis of molecular vibrations, we analyzed their vibrational spectra, temperatures, and heat transport efficiencies. We find that the most efficient energy transfer mechanisms are associated with solvent-mediated friction. However, this mechanism only applies to a small number of degrees of freedom of a protein. Instead, less efficient vibrational energy transfer in the far-infrared dominates heat transfer overall due to a large number of vibrations in this frequency range. A notable by-product of this work is a highly sensitive measure of deviations from energy equi-partition in equilibrium systems, which can be used to analyze non-ergodic properties.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2504.00210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Stochastic quantum trajectories, such as pure state evolutions under unitary dynamics and random measurements, offer a crucial ensemble description of many-body open system dynamics. Recent studies have highlighted that individual quantum trajectories also encode essential physical information. Prominent examples include measurement induced phase transitions, where a pure quantum state corresponding to fixed measurement outcomes (trajectories) exhibits distinct entanglement phases, depending on the measurement rate. However, direct observation of this effect is hindered by an exponential post-selection barrier, whereby the probability of realizing a specific trajectory is exponentially small. We propose a deterministic method to efficiently prepare quantum trajectories in polynomial time using imaginary time evolution and, thus, overcome this fundamental challenge. We demonstrate that our method applies to a certain class of quantum states, and argue that there does not exist universal approaches for any quantum trajectories. Our result paves the way for experimentally exploring the physics of individual quantum trajectories at scale and enables direct observation of certain post-selection-dependent phenomena.</p>

In a recent article, the first two authors of the present paper introduced partially cosymplectic structures as a geometric framework for thermodynamic systems, recovering the evolution equations obtained variationally. In this paper, we develop a discrete variational principle for adiabatically closed simple thermodynamic systems, which can be utilised to construct numerical integrators for the dynamics of such systems.

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02539v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: While fluids near a solid surface are at the core of applications in energy storage/conversion, electrochemistry/electrowetting and adsorption/catalysis, their nanoscale behavior remains only partially deciphered. Beyond conventional effects (e.g. adsorption/reaction, interfacial transport, phase transition shifts), recent experimental and theoretical studies on metallic surfaces have unraveled exotic peculiarities such as complex electrostatic screening, unexpected wetting transition, and interfacial quantum friction. These novel features require developing and embarking new tools to tackle the coupling between charge relaxation in the metal and molecular behavior in the vicinal fluid. Here, using the concept of Virtual Thomas-Fermi fluids, we employ a molecular simulation approach to investigate interfacial transport of fluid molecules and metal charge carriers at their interface--including the underlying electrostatically-driven dynamic friction and the coupling between charge current/hydrodynamic flow (the so-called electrohydrodynamic drag). While conventional numerical techniques consider either insulating materials or metallic materials described as polarizable, non-conducting media, our atom-scale strategy provides an effective yet realistic description of the solid excitation spectrum--including charge relaxation modes and conductivity. By applying this approach to water near metallic surfaces of various electrostatic screening lengths, we unveil a non-monotonous dependence of the fluid/solid friction on the metallicity with a maximum occurring as the charge dynamic structure factors of the solid and fluid strongly overlap. Moreover, we report a direct observation of the electrohydrodynamic drag which arises from the momentum transfer between the solid and liquid through dynamic electrostatic interactions and the underlying interfacial friction.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Understanding and establishing design principles to tune the excited states of earth-abundant sensitizers is crucial for identifying new photosensitizers for sustainable technological advancements. Here, we report a series of three bis Zr (IV) complexes of tridentate, dianionic ligands incorporating two phenoxide donors and aza arene acceptors of increasing electron affinity (pyridine &lt; pyrimidine &lt; pyrazine ) that are air and water-stable. These complexes emit via thermally assisted delayed fluorescence from an intraligand charge transfer excited state with varying metal contributions. The electronic structural changes from different acceptors vary the excited state character and the photophysical properties significantly between the complexes. The variation in photophysics that includes emission lifetime (76 μs to 265 ns), intersystem crossing (ISC) lifetime ( 390 – 290 ps), and the energy difference between the singlet and triplet excited states (∆EST. 170 -100 meV). We observe solvent-independent ISC rates when the excited state has metal contributions (acceptor = pyridine), and the ISC rates vary significantly with solvent polarity when the excited state is an intra-ligand charge transfer state (acceptor = pyrimidine and pyrazine). Transient absorption measurements provided the basis spectra and verified the metal contribution in the excited state. This work provides a basis for developing new sensitizers based on Zr (IV) by providing design principles that can be used to modulate the character of the excited state and its photophysics.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The axial ligand of heme is a key determinant of reactivity in heme-dependent enzymes, yet its systematic engineering remains challenging due to the limited chemical diversity of natural amino acids. Here, we demonstrate that replacing the native histidine axial ligand with a non-natural analog provides an effective strategy to regulate heme enzyme activity. By site-specifically incorporating δVin-H into APEX2, we reprogrammed the electronic structure of the heme center and unlocked catalytic activity toward aromatic amine substrates. Directed evolution of the APEX2-VinH enzyme yielded APEX3-VinH, which exhibits a pronounced enhancement in catalytic efficiency and robustness for aromatic amine oxidation. Notably, optimization of the δVin-H synthetase enabled highly efficient incorporation. This work establishes axial ligand engineering via genetic code expansion as a general and powerful strategy to reprogram the catalytic repertoire of heme enzymes, with broad implications for biocatalysis and the development of next-generation proximality labeling tools.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Cellular membranes have diverse phospholipids, chemical differences in whose headgroups impact many biological processes. Phosphatidylcholine is an essential phospholipid for human health, but not universally required for life. The evolutionary mechanisms underlying phospholipid preferences remain poorly understood, due to the difficulty of investigating metabolite structure-activity relationships in a cellular context. Here, we developed a generalizable metabolic-rewiring method to manipulate phospholipid headgroups together and their biological effects. This approach utilizes synthetic media to hijack evolutionarily conserved phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, leveraging xenobiotics as principal precursors for scalable headgroup transformations. By identifying over 100 artificial headgroups, we expanded the chemical diversity of xenobiotic phospholipids. Unexpectedly, we discovered that subtle headgroup alterations produced distinct mammalian cellular activities. We demonstrated that chemical headgroup modifications differentially elicited structure-dependent effects on phospholipid-protein interactions, calcium dynamics, transcriptomic profiles, and stem cell differentiation. Notably, cross-species comparison revealed that human and yeast cells have different headgroup preferences critical for cell life and death. As proof-of-concept, interactome analysis identified headgroup-sensitive human microproteins vital for mitochondrial respiration, but non-conserved in yeast. These results exemplify the evolutionary diversity of key phospholipid-protein interactions, illustrating why humans depend on phosphatidylcholine. Overall, our findings establish a programmable platform for elucidating and engineering phospholipid-driven cellular functions.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This mouse meiosis study identifies a SYCP2 closure motif that recruits HORMAD2 to unsynapsed chromosome axes, enabling ATR-mediated synapsis checkpoint signaling, but it has minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research beyond general DNA biology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Faithful chromosome segregation during meiosis depends on accurate recombination and synapsis of homologous chromosomes. These processes are monitored in mammals by checkpoint mechanisms involving the meiotic HORMA-domain proteins HORMAD1 and HORMAD2, which bind unsynapsed chromosome axes and promote activation of the DNA damage-response kinase ATR independently of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). However, no mechanism for axis recruitment of HORMAD1 or HORMAD2 had been demonstrated, nor had its role in checkpoint function been tested. We establish that a putative HORMAD-interacting region--the closure motif (CM)--within the chromosome-axis component SYCP2 is selectively required for HORMAD2, but not HORMAD1, localization. Deletion of the SYCP2 CM disrupts SYCP2-HORMAD2 complexes and prevents HORMAD2 axis binding without affecting axis assembly or recombination. Consequently, ATR accumulation and signaling on unsynapsed axes are reduced, and the prophase checkpoint malfunctions in a sexually dimorphic manner--causing aberrant elimination of synapsis-proficient spermatocytes and persistence of asynaptic oocytes. The phenotypes of SYCP2-CM-deficient and HORMAD2-null mice are indistinguishable, establishing the requirement for HORMAD2 axis recruitment in synapsis surveillance. We propose that axial recruitment generates a HORMAD2 scaffold that drives clustering-mediated ATR network activation independently of DSBs, thereby linking chromosome-axis architecture to synapsis quality control in mammalian meiosis.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This preprint identifies an SLBP-independent mechanism (PETISCO–TOST-1) that stabilizes maternal replication-dependent histone mRNAs in C. elegans and suggests this machinery was later co-opted for piRNA biogenesis, offering limited indirect relevance to molecular evolution rather than origins-of-life.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Replication-dependent (RD) histones are crucial for packaging newly replicated DNA into chromatin, ensuring genome stability. In metazoans, the mRNA of RD histones is uniquely regulated through a conserved 3&#x27; stemloop bound by stemloop binding protein (SLBP). This allows cell cycle-coupled regulation of these important transcripts. However, oocytes must stabilise histone mRNAs independently of the cell cycle to ensure maternal loading to support the first embryonic divisions. Using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system, we discovered an SLBP-independent mechanism that ensures RD histone transcript stability during oogenesis. This is mediated by the protein complex PETISCO, bound to the effector protein TOST-1, which directly binds the histone stemloop region and maintains maternal histone mRNA levels during oogenesis and early embryogenesis. Loss of this mechanism disrupts histone homeostasis, leading to premature genome activation, mitotic defects, and embryonic lethality. Interestingly, the same complex, PETISCO, acts in piRNA biogenesis when bound to the effector PID-1, revealing an intriguing co-option of this histone mRNA homeostasis mechanism by the piRNA pathway. Our findings reveal a unique SLBP-independent mechanism of histone mRNA regulation, that served as a basis for the evolution of a novel piRNA biogenesis mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Coding and non-coding RNAs have traditionally been viewed as functionally distinct entities. Here, we found that the down-regulation of Pink1 due to Tet2 knockout (KO) in muscle cells resulted in mitochondria dysfunction and muscle fatigue. Surprisingly, both Pink1 mRNA alone and untranslatable ATG-deficient Pink1 RNA were sufficient to rescue the mitochondria defects in Tet2 KO cells. PINK1 protein was fast degraded shortly after translation and dispensable for functions of Pink1 mRNA in muscle cells. Moreover, a portion of Pink1 mRNA was located in mitochondria and interacted directly with mitochondria inner membrane located protein YME1L1, promoting its proteolytic cleavage of Opa1, a master regulator of mitochondria fusion, to generate the mature protein form. These findings uncovered a bona fide non-coding role for a canonical mRNA, suggesting that translation independent functions could be present in mRNAs with coding potentials, blurring the conventional dichotomy between coding and non-coding RNAs.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Even in the absence of mutagenic factors, spontaneous errors in DNA replication generate genetic diversity in microbial populations. The spontaneous mutation rate is not immutable but may be conditionally elevated. However, it remains unresolved whether apparently non-stressful nutritional or genotypic conditions affect the spontaneous mutation rate. Here, we determined the spontaneous mutation rate of haploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK113-7D in three nutritional and three genotypic conditions. The nutritional and genotypic conditions influenced the specific growth rate of the S. cerevisiae population. Thus, we extended the established fluctuation assay for spontaneous mutation rate determination with CAN1 as a reporter gene to populations with different generation times. We applied the method to determine the spontaneous mutations rates in wild type S. cerevisiae grown on glucose and ammonium, raffinose and ammonium, and glucose and L-tryptophan as sole carbon and nitrogen sources. Alike we determined the spontaneous mutation rates of two engineered S. cerevisiae strains (i.e., representing genotypic conditions different from wild type) on glucose and ammonium medium. The engineered strains had two to three heterologous or variant genes integrated into the genome, common to simple heterologous small molecule production host strains. In all alternative nutritional and genotypic conditions, the spontaneous mutation rate of S. cerevisiae was reduced compared to wild type growing on glucose and ammonium medium. Spontaneous mutation rate is fundamentally relevant for evolvability of strains, but it may also influence the performance robustness of microbial populations in applications such as food or beverage fermentation or biotechnological chemical production. Our novel findings are important for biotechnological processes using microbial cells, often engineered and cultivated in unnatural chemical environments.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> FOF1-ATP synthase is one of the most abundant proteins of the mitochondrial inner membrane and the primary enzyme responsible for ATP production in eukaryotic cells. Nevertheless, it was recently reported to play a prominent role in cell death by forming a large-conductance leak channel in the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), making it a promising therapeutic target. Bedaquiline (BDQ), a member of the diarylquinoline class of drugs, was shown to selectively inhibit the catalytic activity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ATP synthase with no effect on the mammalian enzyme. Here, we report a new role for BDQ as a potent inhibitor of the ATP synthase c-subunit leak channel in mammals. BDQ inhibited the single-channel activity of porcine heart ATP synthase in planar lipid bilayer recordings and prevented glutamate-induced cell death in primary hippocampal neurons. These findings reveal the potential new application of BDQ for treating mPTP-related diseases by targeting the ATP synthase c-subunit leak channel.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Clinical biomarker study identifying circulating miR-4532 changes associated with ambulation status in dysferlinopathy patients, with minimal relevance to origins-of-life beyond involving RNA biology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Background: Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMDs) are inherited myopathies characterized mainly by progressive weakness of the proximal muscles of the shoulder and pelvic girdle areas, leading to functional decline and eventual loss of independent ambulation. Dysferlinopathy (LGMD2B) is an autosomal recessive LGMD subtype, is caused by mutations in the DYSF gene that lead to lack of dysferlin which results in muscle death and chronic muscle fiber degeneration. Preservation of ambulation is a key clinical milestone, as loss of independent gait markedly reduces quality of life and complicates care management. Although patients often perceive functional decline before their initial clinical presentation, current clinical assessments typically detect disease progression after substantial muscle damage has occurred. Methods: In this multigroup case-control study, we profiled plasma miRNAs from 49 genetically confirmed dysferlinopathy patients (24 ambulatory, 25 non-ambulatory) and 25 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Total RNA was extracted from blood samples and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip miRNA 3.1 arrays. After quality control and filtering, differential expression analysis was performed using linear models for microarrays, adjusting for age and sex, with a false discovery rate cutoff of 10%. Results: 14 miRNAs were significantly altered between dysferlinopathy patients and controls. Notably, miR-4532 was upregulated in ambulatory patients relative to controls, whereas it was downregulated in non-ambulatory patients compared with ambulatory patients, although expression levels remained higher than in controls. Levels of miR-4532 were positively associated with circulating monocyte levels in ambulatory patients only.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Early JWST observations of TRAPPIST-1 have revealed an unexpected puzzle: energetic white-light flares (E&gt;1030 erg) reach temperatures of only ∼3500–4000,K, nearly three times cooler than typical solar flares, which peak around 9000–10000,K.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> A review arguing that water can actively enhance and reshape organic reactivity (e.g., hydrophobic-effect rate boosts, micellar catalysis, bioconjugation), offering broad-context relevance to origins-of-life by underscoring plausible aqueous reaction networks even though it is not directly focused on prebiotic/abiogenesis chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> For over a century, synthetic chemistry demanded the rigorous exclusion of water, relying on toxic, volatile organic solvents. This paradigm, while successful, is environmentally and economically costly. This review advocates for a fundamental shift: adopting water not just as a green solvent, but as a transformative medium that reshapes our understanding of reactivity and bridges chemistry with biology. Aqueous phase organic synthesis (APOS) has evolved from accidental observations to a deliberate discipline. Water’s unique properties—its high polarity, hydrogen-bonding capacity, and the hydrophobic effect—make it an active participant. This effect drives reactant aggregation and stabilizes transition states, leading to dramatic rate enhancements in pericyclic and condensation reactions. A broad range of reactions thrive in water, including classical carbon–carbon bond-forming reactions like the aldol and Diels–Alder, and modern cross-couplings (e.g., Suzuki–Miyaura) enabled by water-tolerant catalysts. Multicomponent and click chemistries are particularly powerful. Challenges like poor solubility are addressed with micellar catalysis, water-soluble ligands, and precise control of the reaction microenvironment. Beyond sustainability, APOS drives discovery, often yielding improved selectivities, new pathways, and streamlined syntheses of complex targets like pharmaceuticals. Its greatest promise lies in interfacing with biology. Bioorthogonal reactions, such as azide–alkyne cycloadditions, enable labeling and imaging in living organisms. Aqueous compatibility is essential for in situ therapeutic strategies, chemical biology, and advanced bioconjugation techniques for modifying biomolecules. The future converges with emerging technologies: machine learning to navigate complex aqueous systems, flow chemistry for scalability, and the integration of enzymatic with synthetic catalysis. This points toward a unified chemical-biological engineering paradigm. In conclusion, APOS is a mature, versatile field. It is a cornerstone of green chemistry and a critical bridge to biology, accelerating progress in medicine and materials science. Embracing water is both an environmental imperative and a strategic pathway to the next generation of scientific discovery. Introduction: The Solvent Problem in Organic Synthesis For generations, organic synthesis has been defined by precise control over molecular structure carried out in rigorously dried environments. Since the emergence of modern organic chemistry in the nineteenth century, water – the very medium that sustains life – has been regarded as an obstacle to chemical transformation. This long-standing assumption has shaped laboratory routines, industrial manufacturing, and chemical education, reinforcing the idea that successful synthesis depends on strict exclusion of moisture. This introduction revisits that historical mindset, evaluates its environmental and economic consequences, and presents the case for a fundamental transition toward aqueous phase organic synthesis (APOS) as a more suitable platform for future chemical and biological innovation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Clusteroluminescence (CL) refers to a newly emerging luminescence phenomenon observed in non-conjugated structures, particularly aliphatic polymers, which inherently exhibit good biocompatibility and processability. However, precise manipulation of CL properties, such as emission wavelength and efficiency, remains a critical challenge in this field. In this work, we propose methylation as an effective strategy to enhance inter- and intrachain through-space conjugation (TSC), thereby significantly increasing CL intensity. We preliminarily suggest that methylation disrupts hydrogen bonding, liberating the lone-pair n electrons of heteroatoms to participate in n-electron-involved TSC. We believe that methylation may evolve into a general and powerful approach for regulating the CL behavior of polymers, especially in nucleic acid systems.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Review of porous biopolymer–MOF composite materials for practical water-treatment performance (transport, fouling, regeneration), with only tangential relevance to origins-of-life via general water/materials context.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Porous biopolymer platforms integrated with metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) pair the processability of polymer networks with the high surface area and tunable chemistry of MOFs, but reported performance is often difficult to compare across studies due to inconsistent metrics, idealized batch testing, and limited attention to transport, regeneration, and matrix effects. This review evaluates porous biopolymer–MOF composites from a platform-level perspective, emphasizing how architecture, MOF placement, and operating mode shape performance under realistic constraints rather than isolated adsorption capacities. Performance trends are synthesized across major contaminant classes (heavy metals, dyes, pharmaceuticals, and PFAS), focusing on dominant interaction mechanisms and the penalties imposed by diffusion limitations, fouling, and competitive solutes. Regeneration and durability are treated as central determinants of viability, alongside leaching risk and water-matrix realism. To improve comparability and translation, a minimum reporting framework is proposed, specifying essential parameters for both batch and flow systems. Overall, the review provides a structured basis to judge when porous biopolymer–MOF composites justify added complexity for sustainable water treatment.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nonadiabatic effects arising from conical intersections between excited states play a crucial role in the optical properties of a wide range of chromophores and have to be accounted for in first-principles modeling of spectral lineshapes. In this work, we investigate the importance of nonadiabatic effects in the absorption spectra of indole and cyanoindole derivatives by contrasting three modeling approaches. In the Gaussian Condon and Gaussian Non-Condon Theory formalisms, the linear response function is computed from excitation energy fluctuations of independent adiabatic excited states sampled along molecular dynamics trajectories, with the latter approach additionally including transition dipole moment fluctuations to account for Herzberg- Teller-type effects. In contrast, the tensor network-based T-TEDOPA approach allows for numerically exact quantum dynamics simulations of explicitly coupled diabatic excited states. We find that only the explicit coupling of the two lowest-lying excited states, La and Lb, within the T-TEDOPA approach yields accurate absorption spectra for all systems, while an adiabatic treatment underestimates spectral contributions from excitations into states with highly mixed electronic character. We further elucidate the role of polar solvent stabilization of the charge-transfer character La state by comparing indole in vacuum and in water, showing that solvent effects significantly shape the ultrafast population transfer between excited states and contribute to the differences in the experimental absorption lineshapes.

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Mouse exercise physiology study showing intermittent AP-1 (cFos/JunD) activation drives beneficial muscle and metabolic adaptations, with no direct relevance to origins-of-life or astrobiology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Regular physical exercise extends healthspan, yet the molecular mechanisms that translate intermittent contractile stress into lasting benefit remain incompletely understood. Using global nuclear run-on (GRO-seq) in mouse skeletal muscle after treadmill running, we profiled enhancer RNA (eRNA), a sensitive marker of enhancer activity. Activation protein-1 (AP-1), a family of pioneering factors for senescence, emerged as the top transcription factor with motif enrichment in exercise-activated enhancers. Our screen in the contracting C2C12 myotubes pinpointed cFos/JunD as the primary AP-1 factor responsible for contraction-induced transcriptional changes. Muscle-specific overexpression of A-Fos, a dominant-negative mutant of cFos, disrupted transcriptomic responses to exercise and attenuated exercise-mediated improvement in muscle functions. Interestingly, intermittent but not continuous overexpression of cFos/JunD in mouse muscles mimicked exercise-induced transcriptomic changes, increased mitochondrial volume density, enhanced muscle strength and fatigue resistance, and improved glucose tolerance. These results define a transcriptional regulatory signaling pathway linking exercise intermittency to beneficial adaptations and highlight the necessary recovery cycles in training. The paradoxical anti- and pro-aging roles of AP-1 offer insights into the timing and dynamics of stressors and stress responses in shaping senescence and healthspan.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We report high figure-of-merit optical leaf sensors based on dielectric metasurfaces and stimuli-responsive polymers. The metasurfaces have narrowband resonances and are broadly transparent across the visible spectrum to allow photosynthesis for unobstructive monitoring of crop health. These sensors are fabricated at scale using direct nanoimprint lithography into UV curable-TiO2 nanocrystal (NC) inks to structure optical metasurfaces, followed by a room-temperature ligand exchange process to create a nanoporous TiO2 scaffold. The nanoporous TiO2 metasurfaces are then infiltrated by a stimuli-responsive polymer while retaining their geometry and optical quality. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate optical humidity sensors by incorporating the moisture-responsive chitosan biopolymer into the nanoporous TiO2 metasurfaces, resulting in a 430 % improvement in sensitivity compared to conventional RI sensors where the polymer surrounds the metasurface. The sensors are mounted on leaves and the highly reflective resonances, which are readily distinguishable from the leaf background, respond dynamically to leaf water stress, enabling passive, battery-free monitoring of leaf surface humidity.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Neuronal function requires precise long-distance axonal transport mediated by molecular motors and RNA-binding proteins like SFPQ, though regulatory mechanisms remain poorly defined. We identify long non-coding RNA NORAD as a master regulator of this process through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). While SFPQ and kinesin-1 mediate cargo delivery, the specific RNA coordinating their interaction was unknown. We demonstrate NORAD directly binds kinesin light chain 1 (KLC1) and promotes SFPQ condensation into dynamic LLPS droplets, enabling efficient transport. CRISPR-assisted mapping and functional assays show NORAD depletion disrupts granule dynamics, impairs neuroprotective mRNA localization, and induces axonal degeneration. In vitro reconstitution confirms NORAD-KLC1 synergy enhances SFPQ phase separation, and neuron-specific knockout mice exhibit motor deficits with reduced neuronal density. These findings establish the first evidence of lncRNA NORAD-mediated LLPS in axonal transport, revealing a new paradigm for RNA-guided neuronal maintenance.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Materials-engineering study demonstrating single-step interfacial self-assembly of graphene networks templated by water-in-oil emulsions to create conductive, piezoresistive silicone foams, with only limited indirect relevance to origins-of-life self-assembly phenomena.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Segregated network composites achieve electrical percolation at minimal filler loadings by localizing conductivity to architectural boundaries. However, achieving this architecture typically requires tedious multi-step processing, often incompatible with scalable manufacturing. Here, we report the single-step synthesis of a silicone composite segregated network composed of self-assembled percolating graphene networks. These networks are templated by graphene-stabilized water-in-oil emulsions, created by spontaneous exfoliation of graphite at oil/water interfaces generated by agitation. After polymerization of the silicone and removal of the dispersed aqueous phase, the resulting foams achieve conductivities of 0.43 S/m at a 1.37 vol% loading of graphene. This is a 12-fold reduction compared to prior interfacial assembly methods, which require 16.5 vol% loading and thousands of hours of processing to achieve comparable electrical conductivity. Architectural segregation decouples mechanical and electrical properties, enabling application-specific modulus tuning. The foams exhibit reversible piezoresistance with a U-shaped strain response, are stable through 5000 cycles, and provide voltage-controlled heating to 143 °C at milliamp current densities, three orders of magnitude lower than those of continuous CVD graphene networks. The low thermal mass of the air-filled foam structure provides rapid thermal response, achieving 28-second de-icing from -17 °C.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> An interdisciplinary book proposing a framework linking information dynamics with energy across biology, physics, and economics, offering broad conceptual context but little direct engagement with origin-of-life mechanisms or prebiotic chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The scientific understanding of energy, matter, and spacetime has advanced rapidly, whereas the study of information—its properties, behavior, and dynamics—remains underdeveloped. Despite the complexity of knowledge and information, our conceptual and empirical grasp of its evolution lags significantly behind. Progress in disciplines such as artificial intelligence, genomics, cognitive science, cyber governance, global ecology, and quantum mechanics depends critically on a more rigorous understanding of information dynamics. Absent such insight, humanity risks succumbing to entropic forces that threaten systemic stability and long-term survival. In this book, Klaus Jaffe addresses the limitations of prior treatments of infodynamics, many of which have been incomplete, imprecise, or conceptually flawed. It offers an interdisciplinary investigation into the relationship between information and energy, drawing on theoretical and empirical contributions from economics, biology, and physics. By challenging conventional paradigms, the book constructs a conceptual framework that bridges disparate scientific domains and societal processes. The resulting synthesis opens new avenues for empirical inquiry and policy-relevant research, with implications for both academic scholarship and public discourse. Inviting readers to explore the evolving frontier of information science, the book highlights the role of information and its impact on both natural and social systems. More at: link.springer.com</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Demonstrates a reversible-flow electrochemical cell design for ocean-water CO2 removal with reduced mass-transfer limitations and in-situ precipitate cleaning to sustain stable energy intensity, but it has minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Our study focuses on an experimental demonstration of a novel method for CO2 removal from ocean water that combines H2 and redox salt looping to induce pH swings in electrochemical flow cells. Model-driven design optimization guides 3-D printed electrolyte flow channel designs to alleviate mass-transfer limitations. A ridged flow channel with 1 mm thick fins protruding at an angle of 30◦ from the base reduces ferri-/ferro-cyanide redox salt diffusion boundary layer thickness by up to 41% while restricting pressure drop to less than 138 Pa. A notable feature of this work is the experimental validation of the intrinsic in-situ cleaning capabilities enabled by the reversible looping process, eliminating what would otherwise be process down time. Over 4 acidification/basification cycles, 86% removal of fouling from electrode surfaces is demonstrated, while distinctly maintaining a constant electrochemical energy intensity. The lab-scale, proof-of-concept experimental demonstration show promising results, which are interpreted to provide insights and guidelines towards further enhancing scalability and efficiency of oceanic carbon removal and utilization processes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The emergence of polar nematic phases, such as the ferroelectric (N F ) and antiferroelectric (N X ) phases, has opened new frontiers in soft matter science. However, the relationship between molecular structure, intermolecular interactions, and the resulting macroscopic order remains poorly understood. This work investigates the molecular organization in the polar nematic phases of the nJK (n=1-5) homologous series using a combined approach of polarized Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, and Atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations. A central finding is the inadequacy of single-molecule DFT models to describe the system. While DFT accurately predicts vibrational band positions, it fails to replicate their experimental intensities, suggesting that intermolecular interactions are dominant. This is further corroborated by the anomalous temperature dependence of the average absorbance for parallel and perpendicular vibrations, which deviates significantly from simple density effects. Atomistic MD simulations of a multi-molecule system provide insight into this behavior, revealing the formation of locally ordered nanodomains driven by strong short- range correlations. Experimentally, we quantified the primary nematic order parameter (S), which follows a typical progression in the N phase but shows anomalous changes at the N-N X and N X -N F transitions, ultimately saturating at a high value of S ≈ 0.7 in the ferroelectric state. The difference between orthogonal absorbance components for perpendicular vibrations reveals a significant biaxiality order parameter (C) that increases upon cooling and exceeds 1 in the N F phase. This study demonstrates that the unique properties of polar nematics are governed by specific molecular self-assembly and establishes phase biaxiality as a key feature of these systems.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Single-molecule (UMI-corrected) sequencing resolves ultra-low-frequency mutations within influenza RNA quasi-species, quantifying intra-host genetic diversity and selective constraints with information-theoretic metrics.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Influenza viruses exhibit high mutation rates and extensive genetic diversity, which hinder effective vaccine development and facilitate immune evasion (Taubenberger and Morens, 2006; Barr et al., 2010). These mutations arise from the error-prone viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, generating highly heterogeneous viral populations within individual hosts that conform to the quasi-species model of a cloud of related genomes evolving under selection (Domingo et al., 2012). Accurate characterization of this intra-host diversity is crucial for understanding viral evolution and improving vaccine design, yet conventional RNA sequencing often fails to detect low-frequency variants because of technical errors during sample preparation and sequencing. Here, we implement a single unique molecular identifier strategy that reduces sequencing artifacts and achieves an error rate of ~10⁻⁵, enabling single-particle–level quantification of quasi-species diversity. Mutation frequencies greatly exceeding background error confirm their biological origin, while information-theoretic metrics such as Shannon entropy and Jensen–Shannon divergence reveal non-random mutation distributions under selective constraints. This framework supports detailed studies of intra-host viral evolution and may inform artificial intelligence-driven prediction of mutational trajectories and more effective influenza vaccine strategies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Enantioselective hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) has great synthetic potential, but the de novo design of chiral HAT catalysts is challenging. We report a conceptually distinct approach in which chiral HAT catalysts are generated in situ through non-covalent self-assembly of privileged chiral phosphoric acids and commercial 2-mercaptopyridines. The phosphoric acid serves as a modular chiral source that renders the achiral thiol effectively chiral, enabling a previously inaccessible combinatorial space of chiral HAT catalysts. This platform enabled the photochemical deracemization of 2-aryl pyrrolidines, a prevalent scaffold in active pharmaceutical ingredients. Optical enrichment proceeds via enantioselective hydrogen atom relay, in which a single chiral assembly orchestrates both hydrogen atom abstraction and delivery. This concept of relaying chiral information via non-covalent assembly holds broad potential for asymmetric radical catalysis.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01468v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The rapid depletion of dust particles in protoplanetary disks limits the time available for planetesimal formation, as solids are typically accreted onto the central star before dust particles can undergo substantial growth. Dust traps formed at sharp viscosity transitions $-$ such as at the edges of the accretionally inactive dead zones $-$ can halt radial drift and enhance dust coagulation. In this study, dust dynamics is investigated using \texttt{RAPID}, a one-dimensional Lagrangian-Eulerian simulation code that tracks representative particle trajectories over time. In order to explore the effect of physical parameters on dust evolution, a grid of 243 models was run. The simulation grid covers a range of parameters such as viscosity, width of the transition region at the edges of the dead zone, disk surface density exponent, and the collisional fragmentation velocity of the dust particles. The computational domain extends from 1 to 50 AU and covers $5\times10^5$ years of disk evolution, assuming a disk mass of $\sim 0.005\,M_\odot$. The results show that pressure maxima can trap up to $3-10\,M_\oplus$ of dust, depending on the local disk conditions. However, increasing the fragmentation velocity, decreasing the viscosity, or widening the dead zone transition width tends to reduce the effectiveness of dust trapping. The simulation results with \texttt{RAPID} reveal that dust evolution is highly sensitive to the physical conditions of the disk, which governs the early stages of planetesimal growth.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02324v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This study explores the application of autoencoder-based machine learning techniques for anomaly detection to identify exoplanet atmospheres with unconventional chemical signatures using a low-dimensional data representation. We use the Atmospheric Big Challenge (ABC) database, a publicly available dataset with over 100,000 simulated exoplanet spectra, to construct an anomaly detection scenario by defining CO2-rich atmospheres as anomalies and CO2-poor atmospheres as the normal class. We benchmarked four different anomaly detection strategies: Autoencoder Reconstruction Loss, One-Class Support Vector Machine (1 class-SVM), K-means Clustering, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). Each method was evaluated in both the original spectral space and the autoencoder&#x27;s latent space using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics. To test the performance of the different methods under realistic conditions, we introduced Gaussian noise levels ranging from 10 to 50 ppm. Our results indicate that anomaly detection is consistently more effective when performed within the latent space across all noise levels. Specifically, K-means clustering in the latent space emerged as a stable and high-performing method. We demonstrate that this anomaly detection approach is robust to noise levels up to 30 ppm (consistent with realistic space-based observations) and remains viable even at 50 ppm when leveraging latent space representations. On the other hand, the performance of the anomaly detection methods applied directly in the raw spectral space degrades significantly with increasing the level of noise. This suggests that autoencoder-driven dimensionality reduction offers a robust methodology for flagging chemically anomalous targets in large-scale surveys where exhaustive retrievals are computationally prohibitive.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00962v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The giant planet-metallicity correlation revealed that planetary formation depends on the stellar properties. There is growing evidence that it is also valid for smaller hot planets, but it is not clear whether elements other than iron also influence the properties of planetary systems. To investigate this, we determined the abundances of 13 chemical elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni and Cu) for a sample of 561 Kepler exoplanet-hosting stars using high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectra. We find that stars in systems having only large or hot planets are enriched in some elements relative to those having only small or warm planets, respectively, with this signature being related to the underlying stellar metallicity. This Kepler sample is composed of stars belonging to the Galactic low- and high-$\alpha$ sequences, corresponding to the chemical thin and thick disks. Our results reveal that stars enhanced in $\alpha$-elements may facilitate the formation of large planets in metal-poor environments although the iron abundance is still a limiting factor. We also investigated chemical abundances as a function of elemental condensation temperatures and found that there is a diversity of slopes of regardless of the exoplanetary systems hosted by the star. We confirmed that the Sun is depleted in refractory elements relative to the solar twins in our sample, all of which host a diversity of exoplanets, suggesting that this depletion is caused by processes not related to planet formation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2508.04828v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Humans stand alone in terms of their potential to collectively and cumulatively change their culture in an open-ended manner. This open-endedness provides societies with the ability to continually expand their resources and to increase their capacity to store, transmit and process information at a collective-level. Here, we propose that the production of resources arises from the interaction between cultural systems (a society&#x27;s repertoire of interdependent techniques, artifacts, norms and knowledge) and search spaces (an ensemble of needs, problems and goals facing a society). Starting from this premise we develop a macro-level model wherein both cultural systems and search spaces are subject to evolutionary dynamics. By manipulating the extent to which these dynamics are characterised by stochastic or selection-like processes, we demonstrate that open-ended growth is extremely rare, historically contingent and only possible when cultural systems and search spaces co-evolve. Here, stochastic factors must be strong enough to continually perturb the dynamics into a far-from-equilibrium state, whereas selection-like factors help maintain effectiveness and ensure the sustained production of resources. Only when this co-evolutionary dynamic maintains effective cultural systems, supports the ongoing expansion of the search space and leads to an increased provision of resources do we observe open-ended cultural evolution.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01795v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We present a new framework for analyzing the evolution of information in geophysical systems. Understanding how information, and its counterpart, uncertainty, propagates is central to predictability studies and has significant implications for applications such as forecast uncertainty quantification and risk management. It also offers valuable insight into the underlying physics of the system. Information propagation is closely linked to causality: how one part of a system influences another, and how some regions remain dynamically isolated. We apply this framework to the one-dimensional, highly nonlinear Kuramoto-Sivashinsky model and to the shallow-water equations, representing a mid-latitude atmospheric strip. Notably, we observe that information can propagate against the fluid flow, and that different model variables exhibit distinct patterns of information evolution. For example, pressure-related information propagates differently from relative vorticity, reflecting the influence of gravity waves versus balanced flow dynamics. This new framework offers a promising addition to the diagnostic tools available for studying complex dynamical systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2505.11411v5 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Understanding neural network&#x27;s (NN) generalizability remains a central question in deep learning research. The special phenomenon of grokking, where NNs abruptly generalize long after the training performance reaches a near-perfect level, offers a unique window to investigate the underlying mechanisms of NNs&#x27; generalizability. Here we propose an interpretation for grokking by framing it as a computational glass relaxation: viewing NNs as a physical system where parameters are the degrees of freedom and train loss is the system energy, we find memorization process resembles a rapid cooling of liquid into non-equilibrium glassy state at low temperature and the later generalization is like a slow relaxation towards a more stable configuration. This mapping enables us to sample NNs&#x27; Boltzmann entropy (states of density) landscape as a function of training loss and test accuracy. Our experiments in transformers on arithmetic tasks suggests that there is NO entropy barrier in the memorization-to-generalization transition of grokking, challenging previous theory that defines grokking as a first-order phase transition. We identify a high-entropy advantage under grokking, an extension of prior work linking entropy to generalizability but much more significant. Inspired by grokking&#x27;s far-from-equilibrium nature, we develop a toy optimizer WanD based on Wang-landau molecular dynamics, which can eliminate grokking without any constraints and find high-norm generalizing solutions. This provides strictly-defined counterexamples to theory attributing grokking solely to weight norm evolution towards the Goldilocks zone and also suggests new potential ways for optimizer design.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2506.16060v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Atmospheric observations by JWST raise a growing evidence that atmospheric metallicity exhibits an anti-correlation with masses of giant exoplanets. While such a trend was anticipated by planetesimal-based planet formation models, it remains unclear what kind of atmospheric metallicity trends emerge from pebble-based planet formation. Moreover, while recent studies of solar system Jupiter suggest that uppermost observable atmosphere may not represent the bulk envelope composition, it remains uncertain how the envelope inhomogeneity influences the atmospheric metallicity trend. In this study, we develop disk evolution and planet formation models to investigate the possible atmospheric metallicity trends of giant exoplanets formed via pebble accretion and how they depend on the metallicity inhomogeneity within the envelope. We find that pebble-based planet formation produces two distinct mass-metallicity relations depending on planetary birthplace. Planets formed beyond the H2O snowline exhibit a mass-metallicity anti-correlation similar to that predicted by planetesimal-based models if their atmospheres are fully convective. This anti-correlation disappears if the convective mixing is inefficient. In contrast, planets formed inside the H2O snowline show a shallower mass-metallicity anti-correlation, regardless of the efficiency of atmospheric mixing. Many gas giants observed by JWST observations lie around the mass-metallicity relation predicted for formation at close-in orbits, although some planets with sub-stellar atmospheric metallicity appear to require unmixed envelopes and formation beyond the H2O snowline. We also examine the relationship between bulk and atmospheric metallicity and find a clear correlation that closely follows atmospheric metallicity that is comparable to bulk metallicity.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02344v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The evolution of planet-forming regions in protoplanetary disks is of fundamental importance to understanding planet formation. Disks with a central deficit in dust emission, a &quot;cavity&quot;, have long attracted interest as potential evidence for advanced disk clearing by protoplanets and/or winds. Before JWST, infrared spectra showed that these disks typically lack the strong molecular emission observed in full disks. In this work, we combine a sample of 12 disks with millimeter cavities of a range of sizes ($\sim2$-70 au) and different levels of millimeter and infrared continuum deficits. We analyze their molecular spectra as observed with MIRI on JWST, homogeneously reduced with the new JDISCS pipeline. This analysis demonstrates a stark dichotomy in molecular emission where &quot;molecule-rich&quot; (MR) cavities follow global trends between water, CO, and OH luminosity and accretion luminosity as in full disks, while &quot;molecule-poor&quot; (MP) cavities are significantly sub-luminous in all molecules except sometimes OH. Disk cavities generally show sub-luminous organic emission, higher OH/H$_2$O ratios, and suggest a lower water column density. The sub-thermal excitation of CO and water vibrational lines suggests a decreased gas density in the emitting layer in all cavities, supporting model expectations for C$_2$H$_2$ photodissociation. We discover a bifurcation in infrared index (lower in MR cavities) suggesting that the molecular dichotomy is linked to residual $\mu$m-size dust within millimeter disk cavities. Put together, these results suggest a feedback process between dust depletion, gas density decrease, and molecule dissociation. Disk cavities may have a common evolutionary sequence where MR switch into MP over time.</p>

We examine the possible roles of planetary interiors, tectonic regimes, continental coverage, volatile cycling, magnetic fields, and atmospheric composition and evolution in shaping long-term climate stability and biospheric potential. Comparisons with Earth and other planets in the Solar System highlight the diversity of planetary conditions and the rarity of conditions relevant to life. We also discuss contingency and convergence in planetary and biological evolution as they relate to the spread of life in the universe. The observational limits of current and planned missions are assessed, emphasizing the need for models that connect internal dynamics to detectable atmospheric and surface signatures as well as the need for laboratory measurements of planetary properties under a wide range of conditions. The large number of exoplanets promises opportunities for empirical and statistical studies of processes that may have occurred earlier in Earth&#x27;s history, as well as of the other pathways rocky planets and biospheres may take. Thus, exo-geoscience provides a framework for interpreting exoplanet diversity and refining strategies for detecting life beyond the Solar System.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01628v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Correctly interpreting JWST spectra of close-in exoplanets requires a measurement of the X-ray and ultraviolet light that the planets receive from their host stars. Here we provide spectral energy distributions (SEDs) covering the range $\approx5-1\times10^7$A for 20 transiting exoplanet host stars observed in JWST Cycle 1. The SEDs are constructed out of new and archival Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra X-ray Observatory and/or XMM-Newton data combined with spectra from models or stars with similar properties (proxies) filling in unobserved gaps. We have also constructed SEDs of likely Habitable Worlds Observatory targets $\kappa^1$ Ceti, $\tau$ Ceti, $\epsilon$ Indi and 70 Oph B for use as proxies. We find that the JWST target planets almost all experience much stronger ultraviolet fluxes than the Earth, especially in the extreme ultraviolet, even for planets with similar overall instellation. Strong ongoing or past atmospheric escape is possible for a majority of these planets. We also assess the now considerable sample of panchromatic stellar SEDs and its applicability for current JWST observations and beyond.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01020v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We study the influence of dissipation on the Ising-Gamma model. Through observables such as ground-state energy, order parameters, entanglement entropy, etc., we identify each phase region and provide the global phase diagram of the system. The results show that the region of the spiral phase will continuously expand with the increase of dissipation, gradually squeezing the original paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phase regions. Remarkably, unlike the conservative system, the introduction of dissipation will cause two spiral phases with opposite chiralities to emerge simultaneously in the system, which provides a possibility for the manipulation of spiral chirality in cold atomic experiments. Moreover, we reveal the mechanism of the dependence of the transformation between these two spiral phases with distinct chirality on the strength of the relative coefficient of off-diagonal Gamma interactions in the Ising-Gamma model. Since both the relevant order parameters and dissipation can be well controlled within a detectable range, these phenomena can be observed in ultracold atomic experiments.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2511.01231v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: With seven temperate Earth-sized planets revolving around an ultracool red dwarf, the nearby TRAPPIST-1 system offers a unique opportunity to verify models of exoplanet composition, differentiation, and interior structure. In particular, the low bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, compared to terrestrial planets in our solar system, require either substantial amount of volatiles to be present or a corefree scenario where the metallic core is fully oxidised. Here, using an updated metal-silicate partitioning model, we show that during core-mantle differentiation oxygen becomes more siderophile (iron-loving) implying larger planet radii. For the seven TRAPPIST-1 planets, however, we find that they are not sufficiently large to oxidise all the iron in the core, if they differentiate from an Earth-like composition. Oxygen partitioning in rocky worlds precludes coreless planets up to about 4 Earth masses. The observed density deficit in the TRAPPIST-1 planets, and more generally in M dwarf systems if confirmed by future observations, may be explained by system-dependent element budgets during planet formation, which are intrinsically linked to their stellar metallicity.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.11459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach&#x27;s assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.15696v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Sprawling, turbulent cloud formations dominate the meteorology of Jupiter&#x27;s mid-to-high latitudes, known as Folded Filamentary Regions (FFRs). A multi-wavelength characterisation by Juno reveals the spatial distribution, vertical structure, and energetics of the FFRs. The cloud tops display multiple lobes of stratiform aerosols, separated by darker, cloud-free lanes, and embedded with smaller eddies and high-altitude cumulus clouds. These cyclonic FFRs are microwave-bright in shallow-sounding wavelengths ($p&lt;5$ bars) and microwave-dark in deep-sounding wavelengths ($p&gt;10$ bars), with the transition potentially associated with the water condensation layer (6-7 bars). Associating microwave contrasts with temperature anomalies, this implies despinning of cyclonic eddies above/below their mid-planes. Despite deep roots (being detectable in wavelengths sounding $\sim100$ bars), they are ``pancake vortices&#x27;&#x27; with horizontal extents at least an order of magnitude larger than their depth. In the northern hemisphere, FFRs are most common in cyclonic belts poleward of $40^\circ$N (all latitudes are planetocentric), particularly a North Polar Filamentary Belt (NPFB) near $66-70^\circ$N that defines the transition from organised belts/zones to the chaotic polar domain. This distribution explains the high lightning rates from $45-80^\circ$N, peaking in a belt poleward of $52.3^\circ$N, which may trace the availability of water for moist convection. Many observed lightning flashes can be associated to specific FFRs containing bright storms, but some FFRs display no activity, suggesting quiescent periods during storm evolution. Analogies to Earth&#x27;s oceanic eddies suggest that cyclones deform isentropic surfaces at their midplanes, raising deep water-rich layers upwards to promote moist convection, release latent heat, and inject clouds into the upper troposphere.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00944v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Subatomic particles can interact with target nuclei in matter or decay in flight, and an individual high-energy particle can induce a particle shower composed of numerous, lower-energy secondaries. These particle showers broadly exhibit universality across diverse media, including air, water, ice, and other materials, with their development governed by the Standard Model. Full Monte Carlo simulation of particle showers, where each secondary is individually tracked and propagated, can be a computational challenge to perform at scale. Experiments thus resort to parametrized approximations when efficient simulation becomes necessary. Here, we construct distributions of parameters capable of describing the Cherenkov light yield from particle showers in ice, and extensible to other, similar media. Sampling from the distributions allows for a much improved description of event-to-event fluctuations, in amplitude and shape, along the shower axis. Including these effects is essential for a more accurate simulation of signal and background events in current and next-generation neutrino telescopes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02291v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We investigate the angle of repose ${\theta}_r$ of dense suspensions of colloidal silica particles ($d = 2$ $\mu m$ to $7$ $\mu m$) in water-filled microfluidic rotating drums experiments, to probe the crossover between the thermal (colloidal) and athermal (granular) regimes. For the smallest particles, thermal agitation promotes slow creep flows, and piles always flatten completely regardless of their initial inclination angle, resulting in ${\theta}_r = 0$. Above a critical particle size, piles of colloids stop flowing at a finite angle of repose, which increases with particle size but remains below the minimal value expected for athermal frictionless granular materials: $0 &lt; {\theta}_r &lt; {\theta}_{ath} \approx 5.8{\deg}$. We quantify the arrest dynamics as a function of the gravitational P\&#x27;eclet number $Pe_g$, which characterizes the competition between particle weight and thermal agitation. Our measurements are consistent with a recent rheological model [Billon et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids 8, 034302, 2023], in which the arrested state stems from a crossover between glass-like and jamming-dominated regimes as the granular pressure in the pile increases relative to the thermal pressure.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Modeling shows how chirality coupled to non-reciprocal perception and polar alignment produces distinct collective patterns in active particles, offering broad-context insight into chiral self-organization mechanisms potentially relevant to prebiotic/early biological systems.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01572v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Self-propelled particles rarely move in straight lines; environmental interactions, shape asymmetry, and intrinsic torques generically induce curved or fluctuating trajectories. In biological and synthetic systems, this curvature often coexists with directional sensing and non-reciprocal interactions. Motivated by this, we explore the collective dynamics of chiral intelligent active Brownian particles (iABPs) that combine polar alignment with vision-based sensing. By varying the ratio of alignment to visual maneuverability, the vision angle, and the reduced chirality $(\omega/D_r)$, we construct a phase diagram exhibiting diverse collective states: spinners, vortices, ripples, worm-like swarms, rotary clusters, and irregular aggregates. Chirality critically governs their morphology: high chirality yields dilute phases, while moderate to low chirality produces cohesive yet dynamic patterns. Ripple loops emerge as a distinct state, characterized by expanding ring-like motion driven by outward torques and sustained only when both particle number and visual maneuverability are large. Structural and dynamical measures, including polarization, pair correlations, mean-square displacement, and orientation correlations, reveal clear signatures distinguishing these phases. Overall, our results show how chirality, non-reciprocal perception, and alignment together generate collective states inaccessible to non-chiral systems, with implications for chiral active matter in biological and synthetic contexts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01018v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: RNA velocity is an important model that combines cellular spliced and unspliced RNA counts to infer dynamical properties of various regulatory functions. Despite its wide applicability and many variants used in practice, the model has not been adequately designed to directly account for both intracellular gene regulatory network interactions and spatial intercellular communications. Here, we propose a new RNA velocity approach that jointly and directly captures two new network structures: an intracellular gene regulatory network (GRN) and an intercellular interaction network that captures interactions between (neighboring) cells, with relevance to spatial transcriptomics. We theoretically analyze this two-level network system through the lens of control and consensus theory. In particular, we investigate network equilibria, stability, cellular network consensus, and optimal control approaches for targeted drug intervention.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00976v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We present neutrino-transport algorithms implemented in the toolkit for high-order neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics (thornado) and their coupling to self-gravitating hydrodynamics within the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)-based multiphysics simulation framework Flash-X. thornado, developed primarily for simulations of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), employs a spectral, six-species two-moment formulation with algebraic closure and special-relativistic observer corrections accurate to $O(v/c)$, and uses discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for phase-space discretization combined with implicit-explicit time stepping. A key development is a nonlinear neutrino-matter coupling algorithm based on nested fixed-point iteration with Anderson acceleration, enabling fully implicit treatment of collisional processes, including energy-coupling interactions such as neutrino-electron scattering and pair production. Coupling to finite-volume (FV) hydrodynamics is achieved with a hybrid DG-FV representation of the fluid variables and operator-split evolution in Flash-X. The implementation is verified using basic transport tests with idealized opacities and relaxation and deleptonization problems with tabulated microphysics. Spherically symmetric CCSN simulations demonstrate accuracy and robustness of the coupled scheme, including close agreement with the CCSN simulation code Chimera. An axisymmetric CCSN simulation further demonstrates the viability of DG-based neutrino transport for multidimensional supernova modeling within Flash-X. thornado&#x27;s neutrino-transport solver is GPU-enabled using OpenMP offloading or OpenACC, and all CCSN applications included in this work use the GPU implementation. Together, these results establish a foundation for future enhancements in physics fidelity, numerical algorithms, and computational performance, for increasingly realistic large-scale CCSN simulations.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01909v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We investigate the evolution of anisotropies in Bianchi I spacetimes within the framework of the 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scalar field theory. The field equations are formulated using dimensionless variables, and the asymptotic dynamics are studied through a combination of analytical and numerical techniques. For the locally rotationally symmetric case, we analytically explore the stationary points of the field equations. The analysis reveals the existence of accelerating solutions in which the scalar field and the Gauss-Bonnet scalar effectively play the role of a cosmological constant. As a result, both anisotropic and isotropic expanding solutions are recovered, along with the Minkowski spacetime. No scaling solutions are supported by the gravitational model. For the general anisotropic Bianchi I geometry with three distinct scale factors, we find that a class of compactified Kasner-like solutions is obtained. In addition, a new family of solutions follows, describing a two-dimensional splitting of the background geometry. This behavior is similar to the previously observed pure Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in higher-dimensional spacetimes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01159v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Rigorous quantum dynamics calculations provide essential insights into complex scattering phenomena across atomic and molecular physics, chemical reaction dynamics, and astrochemistry. However, the application of the gold-standard quantum coupled-channel (CC) method has been fundamentally constrained by a steep cubic scaling of computational cost [${O}(N^3)$]. Here, we develop a general, rigorous, and robust method for solving the time-independent Schr\&quot;odinger equation for a single column of the scattering S-matrix with quadratic scaling [${O}(N^2)$] in the number of channels. The Weinberg-regularized Iterative Series Expansion (WISE) algorithm resolves the divergence issues affecting iterative techniques by applying a regularization procedure to the kernel of the multichannel Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation. The method also explicitly incorporates closed-channel effects, including those responsible for multichannel Feshbach resonances. We demonstrate the power of this approach by performing rigorous calculations on He + CO and CO + N$_2$ collisions, achieving exact quantum results with demonstrably quadratic scaling. Our results establish a new computational paradigm, enabling state-to-state quantum scattering computations for complex molecular systems and providing a novel window onto the intricate multichannel molecular collision dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2408.03086v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Completely positive transformations play an important role in the description of state changes in quantum mechanics, including the time evolution of open quantum systems. One useful tool to describe them is the so-called Choi isomorphism, which maps completely positive transformations to positive semi-definite matrices. Accordingly, there are numerous proposals to generalize the Choi isomorphism. In the present paper, we show that the 1976 paper of Gorini, Kossakowski and Sudarshan (GKS) already holds the key for a further generalization and study the resulting GKS isomorphism. As an application, we compute the GKS matrix of the time evolution of a general open quantum system up to second order in time.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01071v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: This paper establishes a robust link between quantum dynamics and classical ones by deriving probabilistic representation for both continuous time and discrete time quantum walks. We first adapt Molchanov formula, originally employed in the study of Schrodinger operators on multidimensional integer lattice, to characterize the evolution of continuous time quantum walks. Extending this framework, we develop a probabilistic method to represent discrete time quantum walks on an infinite integer line, bypassing the locality constraints that typically inhibit direct application of Molchanov formula. The validity of our representation is empirically confirmed through a benchmark analysis of the Hadamard walk, demonstrating high fidelity with traditional unitary evolution. Our results suggest that this probabilistic lens offer a powerful alternative for learning multidimensional quantum walks and provides new analytical pathways for investigating quantum systems via classical stochastic processes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2506.09190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Recent developments have extended the concept of global symmetries in several directions, offering new perspectives across a wide range of physical systems. This work shows that generalized global symmetries naturally emerge in shallow water systems. In particular, we demonstrate that two subsystem symmetries-previously studied primarily in exotic field theories-arise intrinsically in the dynamics of shallow water flows. A central result is that the local conservation of potential vorticity follows directly from the first subsystem symmetry, revealing that the classic Kelvin circulation theorem is rooted in these symmetries. Notably, the associated charge algebra forms a Kac-Moody current algebra, with the level determined by the spatial variation of the Coriolis parameter. Beyond the first subsystem symmetry, we also identify a second one, construct the corresponding Noether charges, and explore their potential applications.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Develops a spectral framework for weighted Weyl fractional operators to model aging, infinite-memory systems and analytically explains an &quot;amnesia&quot; transition from power-law to exponential relaxation, with minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02142v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: This paper establishes a rigorous spectral framework for the Weighted Weyl Fractional Calculus, designed to model non-local systems exhibiting aging and subjective time scales. By constructing a conjugation map involving a time-dependent weight $\omega(t)$ and a scale function $\psi(t)$, we define a new class of fractional operators that preserve the spectral tractability of time-invariant systems. We derive the Spectral Mapping Theorem for these operators and prove that Weighted Mittag-Leffler functions act as their fundamental eigenfunctions, demonstrating that the Weighted Fourier Transform naturally diagonalizes the associated evolution equations. As a physical application, we formulate a constitutive law for aging viscoelastic materials with infinite memory. Crucially, we analytically demonstrate the &quot;Amnesia Phenomenon&quot;: we prove that rapid aging modulates the system&#x27;s history, effectively transforming the hereditary power-law decay into a short-range exponential relaxation. This result provides a closed-form explanation for the loss of memory in fast-aging media, overcoming the computational bottlenecks of standard discretization methods.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2508.04828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Humans stand alone in terms of their potential to collectively and cumulatively change their culture in an open-ended manner. This open-endedness provides societies with the ability to continually expand their resources and to increase their capacity to store, transmit and process information at a collective-level. Here, we propose that the production of resources arises from the interaction between cultural systems (a society&#x27;s repertoire of interdependent techniques, artifacts, norms and knowledge) and search spaces (an ensemble of needs, problems and goals facing a society). Starting from this premise we develop a macro-level model wherein both cultural systems and search spaces are subject to evolutionary dynamics. By manipulating the extent to which these dynamics are characterised by stochastic or selection-like processes, we demonstrate that open-ended growth is extremely rare, historically contingent and only possible when cultural systems and search spaces co-evolve. Here, stochastic factors must be strong enough to continually perturb the dynamics into a far-from-equilibrium state, whereas selection-like factors help maintain effectiveness and ensure the sustained production of resources. Only when this co-evolutionary dynamic maintains effective cultural systems, supports the ongoing expansion of the search space and leads to an increased provision of resources do we observe open-ended cultural evolution.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.11459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach&#x27;s assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01159v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Rigorous quantum dynamics calculations provide essential insights into complex scattering phenomena across atomic and molecular physics, chemical reaction dynamics, and astrochemistry. However, the application of the gold-standard quantum coupled-channel (CC) method has been fundamentally constrained by a steep cubic scaling of computational cost [${O}(N^3)$]. Here, we develop a general, rigorous, and robust method for solving the time-independent Schr\&quot;odinger equation for a single column of the scattering S-matrix with quadratic scaling [${O}(N^2)$] in the number of channels. The Weinberg-regularized Iterative Series Expansion (WISE) algorithm resolves the divergence issues affecting iterative techniques by applying a regularization procedure to the kernel of the multichannel Lippmann-Schwinger integral equation. The method also explicitly incorporates closed-channel effects, including those responsible for multichannel Feshbach resonances. We demonstrate the power of this approach by performing rigorous calculations on He + CO and CO + N$_2$ collisions, achieving exact quantum results with demonstrably quadratic scaling. Our results establish a new computational paradigm, enabling state-to-state quantum scattering computations for complex molecular systems and providing a novel window onto the intricate multichannel molecular collision dynamics.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01572v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Self-propelled particles rarely move in straight lines; environmental interactions, shape asymmetry, and intrinsic torques generically induce curved or fluctuating trajectories. In biological and synthetic systems, this curvature often coexists with directional sensing and non-reciprocal interactions. Motivated by this, we explore the collective dynamics of chiral intelligent active Brownian particles (iABPs) that combine polar alignment with vision-based sensing. By varying the ratio of alignment to visual maneuverability, the vision angle, and the reduced chirality $(\omega/D_r)$, we construct a phase diagram exhibiting diverse collective states: spinners, vortices, ripples, worm-like swarms, rotary clusters, and irregular aggregates. Chirality critically governs their morphology: high chirality yields dilute phases, while moderate to low chirality produces cohesive yet dynamic patterns. Ripple loops emerge as a distinct state, characterized by expanding ring-like motion driven by outward torques and sustained only when both particle number and visual maneuverability are large. Structural and dynamical measures, including polarization, pair correlations, mean-square displacement, and orientation correlations, reveal clear signatures distinguishing these phases. Overall, our results show how chirality, non-reciprocal perception, and alignment together generate collective states inaccessible to non-chiral systems, with implications for chiral active matter in biological and synthetic contexts.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.01536v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: The resting voltage, $V$, which is the potential drop required to nullify the electrical current ($i=0$), is a key characteristic of water desalination and energy harvesting systems that utilize macroscopically large nanoporous membranes, as well as for physiological ion channels subjected to asymmetric salt concentrations. To date, existing analytical expressions for $V_{i=0}$ have been limited to simple scenarios. In this work, we derive a universal, self-consistent theoretical model, devoid of unnecessary oversimplifying assumptions, that unifies all previous models within a single framework. This new model, verified by non-approximated numerical simulations, predicts the behavior of $V_{i=0}$ for arbitrary concentration gradients and for arbitrary diffusion coefficients and ionic valences. We show how the interplay between diffusion coefficients and ionic valencies significantly varies the system response and why it is essential to account for all system parameters. Ultimately, this model can be used to improve experimental interpretation of ion transport measurements.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02086v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The liquid-vapor critical behavior of water is strongly influenced by both ionic solutes and confinement. Molecular dynamics simulations of aqueous NaCl solutions using the TIP4P/2005 water model and the Madrid-2019 ion parameters reveal a systematic increase in the liquid-vapor critical temperature and pressure with salt concentration, consistent with experimental trends. In contrast, confinement between parallel hydrophobic plates leads to a depression of the critical point. The critical temperature was determined from the Binder cumulant crossing in the NVT ensemble, using a recently developed method originally applied to an active Brownian particle system. The reliability of this approach was verified through complementary NPT simulations. We further demonstrate the pronounced sensitivity of the estimated critical point to the van der Waals cutoff distance, underscoring the importance of properly accounting for long-range interactions. Our framework, which employs and tests an adjusted subbox method, can be readily extended to other critical phenomena, including the liquid-liquid critical point of water.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.02132v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal evolution of radiolytic species created by high-energy electrons in water underpins key applications from radiotherapy and nuclear safety to environmental processing and electron microscopy. Here, using the Manchester Inhomogeneous Radiation Chemistry by Linear Expansions (MIRaCLE) toolkit, we introduce and benchmark a novel approach to simulating these processes. Although the initial conditions are determined stochastically, the subsequent time evolution is calculated deterministically using a continuum representation, derived from those initial conditions. This hybrid approach essentially averages over many chemistry ``trajectories&#x27;&#x27; simultaneously, often converging to the 1% level in one shot, not requiring multiple runs. We demonstrate this new approach through the calculation of time-dependent G-values for e_{aq}^-$, \dot{\mathrm{OH}} and other radiolytic products, including at unprecedented dose rates where calculations which would take years with a conventional Monte Carlo approach can be performed in mere hours on a commercial laptop. We demonstrate that the main artifact of continuum modelling can be mitigated by a correction term. These results establish MIRaCLE as a flexible and efficient platform for modelling long-timescale radiolysis, providing a bridge between Monte Carlo approaches and macroscopic reaction--diffusion schemes, with broad implications for radiation chemistry in medicine, energy, and materials science.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.24900v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: A capacitor consisting of the [bmim][NTf$_2$] ionic liquid (IL) confined in between planar graphite electrodes has been investigated by molecular dynamics based on an all-atom, unpolarizable force field. Structural and dynamical properties such as: (i) the density and orientation of the [bmim]$^+$ and [NTf$_2$]$^-$ ions throughout the capacitor; (ii) the electrostatic double layer at the electrode / electrolyte interface; (iii) the ions&#x27; mobility perpendicular and parallel to the graphite plates are determined as a function of the electrostatic charge of the capacitor, the concentration of absorbed water, the temperature and pressure. Grouping the [bmim]$^+$ and [NTf$_2$]$^-$ ions into neutral ion pairs reveals an intriguing ordering normal to the interface that is related to correlations among the dipole moments of the neutral ion pairs. These correlations might explain the observation of an anomalous Stark effect (Pockels effect) reported a few years ago in Langmuir, vol. 37, 5193-5201, (2021), and provides useful insight for the multitude of electro-chemical applications that involve electrode / ionic liquid interfaces.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2512.11459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged. This work reviews its progress, practical applications, and limitations. We outline the approach&#x27;s assumptions and foundations, based on direct enumeration of system states, contrasting with classical Smoluchowski and Marcus-Lushnikov methods. Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems. The appendix includes partial Bell polynomials, generating functions, Lagrange inversion, potential applications, and links between combinatorial and scaling solutions of the Smoluchowski equation.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Mechanistic cryo-EM and biochemical study showing how a CUL3–ZSWIM8 E3 ligase recognizes an AGO–miRNA–trigger RNA complex to polyubiquitylate AGO and drive target-directed microRNA degradation, informing modern RNA regulation rather than origins-of-life processes.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> MicroRNAs (miRNAs) associate with Argonaute (AGO) proteins to form complexes that down-regulate target RNAs, including mRNAs from most human genes. Within each complex, the miRNA pairs to target mRNAs to specify their repression, and AGO provides effector function while also protecting the miRNA from cellular nucleases. Although much has been learned about this mode of posttranscriptional gene regulation, less is known about how the miRNAs themselves are regulated. In one such regulatory pathway, unusual miRNA targets called &quot;trigger&quot; RNAs reverse the canonical regulatory logic and instead down-regulate microRNAs. This target-directed miRNA degradation (TDMD) is thought to require a cullin [mdash]RING E3 ligase (CRL) because it depends on the cullin protein CUL3 and other ubiquitylation components, including the BC-box protein ZSWIM8. ZSWIM8 is required for murine perinatal viability and for destabilization of most short-lived miRNAs, but is otherwise poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that a human AGO [mdash]miRNA-- trigger complex selectively binds ZSWIM8 for CUL3-mediated polyubiquitylation of the AGO protein within this complex. Cryogenic electron-microscopy (cryo-EM) analyses show how ZSWIM8 recognizes the distinct AGO2 and miRNA--trigger conformations shaped by pairing of the miRNA to the trigger. For example, this pairing extracts the miRNA from a binding pocket within AGO2, allowing the pocket to be captured by ZSWIM8, and it directs the trigger RNA along a distinct trajectory to be also recognized by ZSWIM8. These results biochemically establish AGO binding and polyubiquitylation as the key regulatory step of TDMD, define a unique CRL class, and reveal generalizable RNA--RNA, RNA--protein, and protein--protein interactions that specify the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of AGO with exquisite selectivity. The substrate features recognized by the E3 ubiquitin ligase do not conform to a conventional degron, but rather establish a two-RNA-factor authentication mechanism specifying a protein ubiquitylation substrate.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> A large comparative analysis across eukaryotes shows that nucleotide diversity (and microsatellite diversity) poorly predicts short-term adaptive potential (evolvability), cautioning against using simple molecular diversity metrics as proxies for adaptation-relevant genetic variance.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> A capacity to adapt is essential for a population to avoid extinction in a changing world and is recognised as a global conservation priority. Adaptation requires additive (heritable) genetic variation for traits that influence survival and fecundity, but measuring this variation is difficult, particularly in species of conservation concern. Instead, molecular genetic diversity is often used to infer adaptive potential. However, previous research has cast doubt on the suitability of traditional molecular markers (allozymes and microsatellites) for this purpose given their weak relationship with heritability - a common measure of additive genetic variance. Recent advances in sequencing technology have since shifted focus towards nucleotide diversity and variation in functional regions, but their practicality for predicting adaptive potential remains debated and untested. Furthermore, heritability itself is a poor proxy for adaptive potential because it depends on environmental variance. We collated 2,113 published estimates of evolvability - a measure of additive genetic variance that avoids environmental confounding - across 193 eukaryotic species, and evaluated how well evolvability is predicted by molecular diversity. We find that microsatellite and nucleotide diversity are not significantly correlated to each other, and neither predict evolvability (nucleotide diversity explains 0.7% of interspecific differences in evolvability and doubling nucleotide diversity only corresponds to a 9.2% increase in evolvability). With new theoretical work, we show that such weak associations are expected. Together, our results suggest that simple molecular measures of genetic variation are insufficient for predicting adaptive potential and continued reliance on these metrics risks misinforming conservation management.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This study dissects how the eukaryotic RNA-binding protein TTP and CCR4-NOT component CNOT10 regulate AU-rich mRNA levels during early gene expression, a mechanistic advance in post-transcriptional control but not directly relevant to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Tristetraprolin (TTP)/ ZFP36 is an RNA binding protein that is involved in the turnover regulation of target adenylate-uridylate-rich RNA element (ARE) containing mRNAs. AREs are present in the 3&#x27;-untranslated region of transcripts expressed from many immediate-early genes, including cytokines and chemokines. It has been demonstrated that TTP-mediated post-transcriptional mRNA decay regulation is crucial for modulating physiological control, particularly in response to inflammatory stimulation. TTP is associated with the CCR4-NOT deadenylation complex through the TTP C-terminus to promote mRNA decay. However, it is not fully understood whether there are additional sites within TTP that contribute to its function through interacting with other factors. We analyzed the functionality of the unique tryptophan residues located in the TTP N-terminus using a cell-based assay system that consists of a tetracycline-responsive CMV promoter-driven, intron-inserted luciferase (LUC). This system enabled us to analyze TTP activity during both the early phase and the steady-state phase of gene expression, as well as in the post-transcriptional mRNA decay following the treatment of tetracycline analogs. Meanwhile, we identified putative TTP associates using a proximity labeling method. We found that tryptophan residues in the TTP N-terminus together with CNOT10, a component of the CCR4-NOT complex, were involved specifically in the reduction of the ARE-containing LUC mRNA level during the early phase of gene expression. However, they were not involved in the decay of LUC mRNA in the steady-state phase. We propose a novel post-transcriptional TTP functionality in the reduction of ARE-containing mRNA level, which differs from the well-characterized mRNA decay activity.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Compared to iron, nickel is comparatively rare as a transition metal in enzymes. But it is essential in several enzymes of carbon and energy metabolism in acetogens (bacteria) and methanogens (archaea), which use the acetyl-CoA pathway of H2-dependent CO2 fixation. Nickel containing enzymes of acetogens and methanogens include FeNi hydrogenase, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, acetyl-CoA synthase and, in methanogens, methyl-CoM reductase in the last step of methane synthesis. Several lines of evidence implicate the acetyl-CoA pathway as the most ancient pathway of CO2 fixation, most notably recent findings that the overall reaction of the enzymatic pathway from H2 (E0&#x27; = -414 mV) and CO2 to pyruvate can be replaced by Ni0 alone in water as the lone catalyst. Here we studied the ability of Ni0 to serve as catalyst and reductant for nonenzymatic redox reactions that require only a mild reductant, as the midpoint potential of Ni0 oxidation to Ni2+ is E0&#x27; = -260 mV. We show that Ni0 in water can convert 2-oxo acids to 2-hydroxy acids and, in the presence of NH3, to amino acids at 25-100C without addition of H2, and that it will function as catalyst and reductant for the fumarate reductase reaction. The findings expand the repertoire of ancient metabolic reactions that Ni0 can catalyze without proteins, cofactors, or sulfur, shedding light on the broad catalytic activity and substrate specificity of Ni0 at metabolic origin.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Presents an MRI-based 3D+time imaging and atlas pipeline to non-destructively quantify early fungal-driven wood degradation in grapevines, with minimal relevance to origins-of-life questions aside from general water-status phenotyping.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In perennial crops, inner wood degradation often escapes detection until irreversible damage has occurred. Grapevine trunk disease (GTD) is a well-known example in viticulture that alters plants from within, years before foliar symptoms arise, making early assessment difficult. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel non-destructive 3D + t pipeline for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) spatial quantification and monitoring of early internal tissue degradation resulting from fungal colonization. This pipeline integrates (i) anatomical alignment and rigid time-series registration of volumetric MRI scans, (ii) a generalized cylindrical coordinate transformation for cross-sectional trunk anatomy normalization, (iii) supervised classification to segment water-depleted (diseased/non-functional) regions, and (iv) population-level statistical analyses including construction of population mean images, probabilistic atlases of lesions, and 3D lesion descriptors. Applied to multiple Vitis vinifera cultivars inoculated with a fungal trunk pathogen, our approach enables time-lapse comparisons of cultivar and treatment in vivo. The results reveal consistent early degradation signals across individuals and cultivar-dependent lesion differences. By combining high-resolution MRI with advanced image processing and statistical atlas tools, this method provides a new paradigm for 3D plant phenotyping of internal disease progression. This methodological innovation allows non-invasive quantification of disease development and comparative assessment of host responses in woody plants, demonstrating its potential to advance understanding and management of GTDs.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Reports an antisense-RNA knockdown mutational strategy in the intracellular bacterium Ehrlichia chaffeensis to reduce expression of an essential outer membrane protein, offering a genetic tool but with minimal direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Obligate intracellular pathogenic bacteria belonging to the order Rickettsiales include several important emerging pathogens causing major health and economic impact to people, companion animals, and agricultural animals. Despite some recent progress, the lack of well-established genetic manipulation methods for diverse research applications remains a challenge. We recently reported the establishment of targeted mutagenesis methods to disrupt genes in Ehrlichia and Anaplasma species. Many essential genes in Ehrlichia chaffeensis are likely refractory to targeted mutagenesis, thus we developed a novel targeted mutational approach leading to the expression of antisense RNA to facilitate the knockdown of p28-Omp19 protein expression from ECH_1143. This gene was selected as its encoded protein is among the highly immunogenic proteins of E. chaffeensis and is likely essential for the pathogen. This method involved introducing a mutation at a distal genomic location within the E. chaffeensis genome to allow for generation of a 209 nucleotide-long antisense RNA segment complementary to ECH_1143 coding mRNA from the same gene promoter which was duplicated as part of the mutagenesis. The mutational strategy was designed to retain the surrounding genomic regions unaltered. The antisense knockdown version of E. chaffeensis resulted in a reduction of p28-Omp19 expression when compared to wild-type E. chaffeensis during its replication in a macrophage cell line, where the gene expression is known to occur. We anticipate that the antisense mutational strategy will be broadly applicable to facilitate investigating essential genes of obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This preprint reports crystal structures and biophysical mechanisms behind the unusually high ATPase activity and dimerization of the plant chloroplast HSP90C chaperone, informing chloroplast protein import but with only tangential relevance to origins-of-life questions.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chloroplasts are the main energy organelles in plants, primary through photosynthesis. Thereby, they are responsible for CO2 fixation and dioxygen production, which are essential for living species on Earth. To ensure these processes, numerous proteins encoded from the nuclear DNA need to be imported inside the chloroplast, and eventually to the thylakoids. Whereas the translocation systems from both chloroplastic and thylakoids membranes have been studied in recent years, the stromal route between these two membranes is largely unknown. Notably, the chloroplastic HSP90 (HSP90C) is likely to play an important role in this process, but its structure and molecular mechanisms remain to be unveiled. In this study, we used a combination of structural and biophysical approaches to elucidate the features of Arabidopsis thaliana&#x27;s HSP90C. Principally, we found that HSP90C has a remarkably high ATPase activity among the HSP90 family proteins. Further investigation allowed us to pinpoint atypical mechanisms responsible for this high activity. First, the N-terminal cap is involved in a disulfide bond that accelerates the ATPase activity of HSP90C. Second, its C-terminal domain features an extension that is mandatory for its dimerization. Third, our crystal structures reveal a wide opening of the HSP90C&#x27;s dimer with reduced intermonomeric interfaces. Lastly, we identified a helical switch which is required for HSP90C&#x27;s high activity. Three of these four features are due to sequence signatures of HSP90C, which we found to be shared by most of green plants representatives. Our study provides first insights of HSP90C&#x27;s non-canonical mechanisms, which will help in the understanding of processes related to protein import in the chloroplast.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Adaptive evolution in Mycobacteria under ethidium bromide selection reveals a hard ceiling on efflux-mediated drug resistance driven by regulatory changes and conserved metabolic rewiring, but it has limited direct relevance to origins-of-life research.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Multidrug-resistant efflux pumps play a critical role in antimicrobial resistance, yet the physiological limits of their overexpression remain poorly understood. While gene amplifications and regulatory mutations commonly drive this overexpression, these pumps remain transcriptionally inactive under normal cellular conditions due to their high energetic cost, making it challenging to assess their full impact on resistance evolution and the maximum attainable minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). To delineate the extent and spectrum of efflux-based resistance, we subjected Mycobacterium smegmatis mc{superscript 2}155(Msm) wild-type and efflux pump-deleted strains ({Delta}lfrA and {Delta}efpA) to adaptive laboratory evolution in the presence of a broad-spectrum efflux substrate ethidium bromide (EtBr). Despite prolonged selection, resistance plateaued at 8-16x MIC, revealing an intrinsic ceiling to efflux-based adaptation. Evolved populations integrated multiple layers of adaptation: enhanced efflux kinetics, reduced intracellular EtBr accumulation, and mutations spanning global regulators, ribosomal genes, and membrane components. Notably, deletion of specific pumps ({Delta}lfrA) triggered compensatory upregulation of alternative efflux systems, highlighting functional redundancy. Beyond efflux activation, evolved strains exhibited metabolic reprogramming, including downregulation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle and upregulation of lipid biosynthesis and {beta}-oxidation, which altered NAD+/NADH homeostasis and membrane potential. Extending this adaptive evolution approach to Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra (Mtb)demonstrated that these adaptive constraints and metabolic alterations are conserved across mycobacterial species. Together, these results uncover fundamental limits to efflux evolution and reveal how bacteria integrate regulatory and metabolic plasticity to maximize drug resistance. Targeting these interconnected networks may offer a powerful strategy to contain the rise of multidrug resistance.</p>

<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Develops a Poisson–hypergeometric theoretical framework and a microfluidic-free droplet digital immunoassay enabling calibration-curve-free absolute protein quantification, a methodological advance with only indirect potential relevance to astrobiological biosignature detection.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Current single-molecule immunoassays primarily rely on Poisson distribution models, which have limitations in achieving absolute quantification of target proteins. To address this, we developed a novel mathematical model that treats the capture of target proteins by magnetic beads as a discrete Poisson process, while the subsequent washing and secondary sampling steps are modeled using a hypergeometric distribution. Based on this combined distribution model, we constructed a new theoretical framework for digital immunoassays and proposed a calibration‑curve‑free absolute quantification method based on micro‑volume calculation. To validate the feasibility of this model, we established a digital immunoassay platform using a water‑in‑oil magnetic bead system without the need for complex microfluidic devices. This approach not only eliminates reliance on traditional calibration curves but also demonstrates enhanced feasibility and a broader dynamic range compared to existing methods such as Single Molecule Immunoassays and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassays. Additionally, it allows for the determination of the binding efficiency and accurate blank coefficients of the detection system. Furthermore, the potential application of an internal calibration method within this system is explored. The proposed theoretical framework offers a new strategy to address the challenge of absolute quantification in protein immunoassays, provides important insights for advancing protein quantification methodologies, and supports the development of more precise detection techniques. It is expected to expand the application of digital immunoassays in biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Trypanosomatid parasites cause diverse diseases in humans and their livestock, but share a unique biological feature, the organization of mitochondrial DNA into a complex structure, named kinetoplast (kDNA), which is crucial for the survival of the parasites. Replication, segregation and expression of kDNA are highly complex processes that involve an estimated ~300 proteins, only a fraction of which have been identified and characterized. Here, we report the development of an unbiased genetic screen in the experimental model Trypanosoma brucei to identify novel factors involved in kDNA maintenance. Our approach uses a combination of genome-wide RNA interference, a novel kDNA staining protocol, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Of the 20 highest-ranked genes identified, six are known kDNA maintenance factors. One hit, Tb927.8.4240, a gene of previously unknown function, was selected for experimental validation and follow-up. Ultrastructure expansion microscopy using a tagged version of the protein reveals a dynamic localization during the cell cycle. RNAi-mediated ablation of Tb927.8.4240 results in the progressive but incomplete loss of kDNA, with only a minor effect on the tripartite attachment complex, suggesting the protein is involved in kDNA replication but not segregation. The growth phenotype of Tb927.8.4240 ablation is fully rescued in a kDNA-independent genetic background, confirming a specific role in kDNA replication.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked protein (ATRX) is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler that performs diverse functions, including spacing nucleosomes, facilitating the deposition of histone variant H3.3, and preventing replication stress. The mechanism by which ATRX modulates chromatin is unknown. Here, our cryo-EM structure revealed that ATRX recognizes and modulates the nucleosome through its C-terminal regions by embracing and unwrapping ~18 base-pair nucleosomal DNA near the entry/exit sites in the presence of ADP-BeF3. Strikingly, the DNA minor groove between SHL6 and SHL7 is profoundly deformed by a pin-like structure in ATRX, which uniquely intercalates the aromatic side chain of a phenylalanine into the base stackings. Biochemical assays revealed the crucial role of this phenylalanine in sliding the nucleosome without affecting the ATPase activity. Such a pin-like structure mimics a foot-step on the DNA ladder, which differentiates ATRX from other remodelers. To translocate the DNA on the nucleosome, two more features, including a disordered insertion that contacts the histone surface and a positively charged loop bridging the cross-gyre interactions, serve as essential anchors for the nucleosome modulation by ATRX. Together, we propose a climbing model for how ATRX mobilizes the DNA upon ATP hydrolysis.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Error</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Light-driven hydrogen evolution is a promising strategy for solar fuel production. While numerous systems for molecular photocatalysis exist, their implementation into reusable soft materials remains challenging due to catalyst leaching, solubility issues, and limited structural integration. Here, we report the first hydrogel system in which a molecular photocatalyst is covalently embedded as crosslinker. Using a bipyridine- annulated perylene dye bearing terminal alkene groups, we employ thiol-ene click chemistry to incorporate the dye into a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based hydrogel network. Post-synthetic platinum coordination yields “Dyedrogels” – mechanically robust hydrogels of varying shape that retain their photocatalytic functionality under visible-light irradiation in pure water, without any solubilizing additives. Structural and optical characterization confirms a homogeneous distribution of the catalyst, while indicating only negligible platinum leaching. Despite moderate hydrogen evolution turnover numbers (TON = 0.03), the stability, modularity, and reusability of this platform underscore its value as a device-like material for future flow-reactor designs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a photocatalytically active hydrogel in which the molecular catalyst itself constitutes a covalent crosslink within the polymer network.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Hydrogel-based lung sealants are optimized largely based on formulation and post-cure mechanics, even though deformation history during delivery and placement plays a critical, yet under-characterized, role in determining in situ performance. This disconnect is particularly consequential on the application of lung sealants, where excessive stiffness promotes delamination while insufficient stiffness compromises airtight sealing. Here, we establish a quantitative process–structure–property framework for a gelatin–tannic acid–transglutaminase lung-mimetic sealant by integrating time-resolved rheology with physics-informed machine learning. Using small-amplitude oscillatory shear and steady torsional flow at 37 °C, we show that gelation follows a reproducible kinetic clock (storage modulus, G′– loss modulus, G″, crossover at ~100 s; modulus plateau by ~600 s), while the attainable viscoelastic state is strongly governed by deformation history. Increasing oscillatory strain amplitude from 0.1 % to 50 % suppresses network maturation, reducing the post-gelation storage modulus, G′, from ~10⁶ to ~10⁴ Pa, whereas sustained steady shear (0.01–1 s⁻¹) decreases magnitude of complex viscosity by 2–3 orders of magnitude and permanently downshifts elastic moduli, G′–, from ≈3.5×10³ to ≈4×10² Pa. These modulus ranges span the effective compliance of lung parenchyma under physiological tidal strain, delineating mechanical regimes associated with airtight sealing, strain accommodation, or premature interfacial failure. Controlled aeration during the processing of the sealant further decreases stiffness by ~30 % without altering gelation kinetics, providing an additional, physically interpretable compliance-tuning mechanism. To unify these effects, we introduce a dimensionless Degree of Gelation (DoG), serving as a rheological state variable that collapses oscillatory and steady-shear histories into a single, time-resolved descriptor of network evolution. Machine-learning models trained on experimentally accessible inputs (time, strain amplitude, shear rate, frequency, aeration) accurately predict DoG (R² ≈ 0.9) and, in inverse mode, identify handling conditions required to achieve targeted in situ mechanical states. This rheology–machine-learning framework reframes lung sealant development from a static materials optimization problem to a controllable, process-driven design strategy. By quantitatively linking applicator-level parameters to failure-relevant mechanical outcomes—airtightness, compliance, and resistance to delamination—it provides a mechanistic and generalizable foundation for the design of injectable hydrogels, bioadhesives, and tissue-interfacing</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We report a novel CO2 capture and separation principle based on the unexpected formation of CO2-loaded amine hydrates. Unlike conventional amine scrubbing, which relies on energy-intensive thermal regeneration, our approach utilizes a phase change driven by cooling. We discovered that various bifunctional amines, upon capturing CO2 in aqueous solutions containing tetrahydrofuran (THF), are structurally incorporated into the hydrate crystal lattice. This phenomenon was unequivocally confirmed via solid-state NMR and FTIR spectroscopy, with some hydrates exhibiting a distinct blue coloration. This phase separation facilitates partial dehydration and the partitioning of CO2-loaded amines into the solid phase, effectively reducing the working solution’s heat capacity. Scalability was successfully demonstrated in a 150-mL system under ambient pressure. These findings establish a new regime in amine-CO2-water chemistry, offering a “cooling-based” fractionation strategy to significantly lower the energy penalty of carbon capture processes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Aromatic rings are widely recognized in the realm of natural products and bioactive molecules, highlighting their importance in various applications. The development of deuterated analogues of pharmaceuticals is particularly significant in pharmaceutical and medicinal chemistry. In this study, we present a novel catalytic method for hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange in aromatic compounds, employing D2O as the deuterium source, which is not only easily accessible but also cost-effective. This approach demonstrates impressive deuterium incorporation under mild reaction conditions, yielding good to excellent results in a single run. Utilizing para-toluenesulfonic acid (pTSA) as a catalyst, this metal-free protocol exhibits broad applicability in the late-stage deuteration of a variety of bioactive molecules, pharmaceuticals, and small molecules. Furthermore, our method is scalable; it has been successfully implemented at the gram-scale with a reduced catalyst loading of 2.0 mol% for Tyrosol, illustrating its practical utility. Moreover, our thorough mechanistic studies and detailed DFT studies enhance our understanding of how the catalyst and solvent contribute to the aromatic electrophilic substitution process. This innovative method provides a sustainable alternative to traditional transition metal-catalyzed H/D exchange techniques. It addresses key challenges such as the use of expensive metals, the risk of undesired reactions, and the need to remove metal impurities from products. Overall, this research enhances the efficiency and environmental friendliness of H/D exchange in aromatic compounds.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Recognition of foreign molecules inside cells is critical for immunity in all domains of life. Proteins of the STAND NTPase superfamily, including eukaryotic nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), play a central role in this process. In bacteria and archaea, although several STAND NTPase families have been reported to sense phage proteins, their functional diversity remains largely unexplored. Here, we conducted a systematic phylogenetic analysis of prokaryotic STAND NTPases and identified at least 90 structurally distinct families associated with antiviral defense. We first show that the uncharacterized Avs7 family recognizes the major capsid protein (MCP) of tailed phages. Three cryo-EM structures of Salmonella enterica Avs7 reveal an asymmetric, butterfly-shaped tetramer that assembles stepwise via large, MCP-induced conformational changes, incorporating bacterial translation elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) as a scaffold that is required for full defense activity. Using highly parallel genetic screens, we further show that 13 additional STAND families sense 12 conserved phage protein folds, encompassing most of the core structural and replicative components of tailed phages. These include two structurally distinct families--Avs8 (PD-{lambda}-4) and Avs10 (Erebus/Hypnos/bNACHT64)--that also recognize MCP, as well as 11 other families (Avs11-21) that recognize the portal, portal adaptor, tail nozzle, head-tail connector, tail terminator, tail tube protein, tail assembly chaperone, tape measure protein, DNA polymerase, helicase/RecA-type ATPase, and single-stranded DNA annealing protein (SSAP), respectively. Together, our findings highlight structure-based pattern recognition and host factor repurposing as fundamental strategies of bacterial immunity.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Given that Mexico is one of the world&#x27;s leading consumers of bottled water per capita, this study provides the first evidence of microplastic contamination across ten widely consumed commercial brands in the country. A total of 2,358 MP particles were detected with an average concentration of 39.3 ± 14.6 particles/L. Statistical analysis (ANOVA, p = 0.0008) confirmed significant differences in MP levels between brands, likely attributed to variations in the production process and packaging quality. Fibers were the predominant shape of the detected MPs (72.2 %), and transparent particles were the most frequent color (57.7 %). Crucially, most detected MPs were smaller than 500 µm (80.3 %), raising toxicological concerns due to the high probability of systemic translocation in human tissues. Furthermore, FTIR spectroscopy confirmed that PET (66 %) and PP (18 %) were the dominant polymers, indicating that fragmentation and abrasion of the bottle and caps are the primary sources of MPs. The estimated intake assessment revealed that children are the most vulnerable population segment (228.2 particles/kg/year), exhibiting the highest relative MP dose normalized by body weight. Given the global evidence of adverse health effects from these polymers and their leached chemical additives, these findings underscore the urgent need to implement effective strategies to minimize MP exposure in bottled water.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Pyridinium compounds are promising electrolyte candidates for aqueous flow batteries yet undergo complex parasitic processes involving free radical species that remain difficult to monitor, track and regulate. Inspired by biological redox signaling, we developed operando pH monitoring to accurately track native pyridinium electrolyte processes across nine orders of magnitude (i.e., pH 3 – 12), elucidating trace (nanomolar) state-of-charge-dependent equilibria that can be used for continuous monitoring of state of charge and health in materials that do not feature a principal proton coupled redox process. By monitoring pH, we gain simultaneous real-time insights into direct and mediated water splitting, direct and mediated dioxygen reduction, oxidation-statedependent pyridinium pKa effects, and trans-membrane OH– transport. These insights inform the development of a global regulation strategy, based on a single radical dependent dimensionless parameter, towards complete suppression of parasitic processes under practical battery cycling conditions. We also clarify the nature of the reaction between dioxygen and reduced viologen towards improved system engineering for long duration energy storage applications.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Due to their low manufacturing cost and versatility in delivering diverse nucleic acid payloads such as plasmids (pDNA) and genome editor proteins, polymers have emerged as promising vectors in gene therapy. To encapsulate and deliver anionic nucleic acids, researchers add cationic polymers to payloads (e.g., pDNA), forming highly fragile, complex, and heterogeneous polyplex assemblies. Large stoichiometric excesses of protonotable amine groups (in the polymers) over the phosphate groups (in the pDNA) are typical of polyplexes, which are frequently formed at nitrogen-to phosphorous ratios between 5–100 . Rather than binding irreversibly to pDNA payloads, polymers predominantly exist as “free polymers” which dynamically exchange with pDNA-bound polymers. Analogous to empty lipid nanoparticles and empty viral capsids, free polymers pose complex characterization, quality control, and regulatory challenges that may hinder clinical translation. We urgently need to quantify how free polymers modify critical polyplex properties (e.g., pDNA loading per polyplex) as well as biological outcomes (e.g., immunogenicity, pDNA delivery efficiency, and toxicity). We developed a unique analytical approach that unveils hitherto unsuspected roles played by free polymers during the complexation and intracellular delivery of pDNA. Applying asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4), we gently separated free polymers from crude polyplexes while conserving polyplex integrity. Unlike batch light scattering analysis of fractionated crude polyplexes, which severely underestimate polyplex size and pDNA loading per polyplex, AF4 sharpened measurements of polyplex molecular weight, pDNA loading, and radius of gyration by removing free polymers and their background scattering contributions. Comparing solution properties via light scattering, we discovered that AF4-purified polyplexes appeared over twice as large, loading twice as much pDNA as crude polyplexes. AF4 uncovered contrasts in the biological performance of crude and purified polyplexes. Free polymers aggravated inflammatory responses in macrophages by up to 22%. Removing free polymers depressed transfection efficiency by 50% while improving cell viability by 30%; reintroducing free polymers abrogated these contrasts. By separating and quantifying free polymers in polyplexes, AF4 illuminated a far more complex portrait of polyplex solution properties that has hitherto remained elusive to conventional characterization methods. Our work has revealed pathways to ameliorate polymer-associated toxicity and inflammation during pDNA delivery.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> New research shows Karnak Temple was built on a rare island of high ground formed as Nile river channels shifted thousands of years ago. Before that, the area was too flooded for settlement, making the temple’s eventual rise even more remarkable. The landscape closely mirrors ancient Egyptian creation myths, where sacred land emerges from water. This suggests Karnak’s location was chosen not just for practicality, but for its deep symbolic power.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Enterotoxins cause severe diseases worldwide, exacerbated by limited access to clean water, food, and medical care. Cholera is a diarrheal disease driven by cholera enterotoxin (CTX) and is secreted by Vibrio cholerae in the small intestinal (SI) epithelium. CTX consists of an enzymatic A subunit (CTA) and a pentameric B subunit (CTB), which mediates cellular uptake by binding to glycans. While CTB primarily recognizes GM1 glycosphingolipid or galactose ligands, GM1 is undetectable in the human SI, and fucose ligands are a key alternative binding target. Previously, we developed linear norbornenyl glycopolymers as biomimetic inhibitors that block CTB binding through interchain crosslinking, forming CTB-glycopolymer aggregates. To assess the polymers’ potential efficacy under flow conditions, we evaluated CTB-glycopolymer binding kinetics under dynamic conditions using surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Copolymer with a random display of galactose and fucose (pGal50Fuc50) showed nanomolar avidity with stable complex formation driven primarily by a slow dissociation rate in the multivalent phase (kd1). In contrast, an equimolar mixture of homopolymers (pGal100 + pFuc100) exhibited similar binding avidity and comparable inhibitory efficacy but did not display slow-dissociation. Moreover, random copolymer pGal25Fuc75 dissociated slowly even from low-CTB-density surfaces. These results highlight the superior stability of copolymers in forming CTB–copolymer aggregates under low CTB abundance and flow conditions. These findings underscore the importance of co-displaying galactose and fucose for complex formation and for developing clinically-useful therapies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The poor solubility and dispersibility of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in aqueous media remain critical limitations for their practical application because conventional oxidative treatments typically require harsh conditions that degrade the nanotube structure. Here, we report a simple and scalable method for dispersing SWCNTs in water via chlorine dioxide (ClO₂•)-mediated oxidation under ambient conditions. The treatment selectively introduced oxygenated functionalities—including hydroxy, carbonyl, and carboxy groups—onto the CNT surface while preserving the tubular framework, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses. The resulting dispersions exhibited long-term colloidal stability without the need for surfactants, supported by a strongly negative ζ potential (−41.6 mV). Importantly, electronic conductivity was largely maintained: the resistivity of oxidized CNT films was only threefold higher than that of sodium cholate–dispersed CNTs (0.045 vs 0.016 Ω·cm at 25 °C), with &lt;10% variation between 25 and 50 °C. This unique balance between enhanced aqueous dispersibility and preserved charge transport underscores ClO₂• oxidation as a green and effective strategy for producing water-processable CNTs, showing promise for applications in pharmaceutical drugs, printable electronics, functional composites, energy storage, and sensing.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00354v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) are filamentary moisture pathways responsible for a large fraction of extreme precipitation and often occur as interacting filament bundles within the same synoptic regime. Existing diagnostics typically analyze ARs in isolation, despite the frequent coexistence and interaction of multiple filaments. We introduce a topological framework for AR analysis based on framed braids and framed braidoids, which encodes both the geometric interaction of AR centroids and the internal evolution of moisture transport. In this approach, AR filaments are represented as strands whose time-ordered crossings form braid words, while moisture-based framing captures internal intensification or weakening along each filament. Applying this framework to reanalysis-derived Atmospheric River track data, we construct braid and framed braid representations over sliding time windows and analyze a strongly interacting multi-filament AR episode in the North Pacific. The results show that braid-based indicators capture structural reorganizations and moisture intensification episodes that are not apparent from centroid geometry or IVT magnitude alone, offering a complementary structural perspective on atmospheric moisture transport.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00062v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We study a periodically driven macrospin system with anisotropic long-range interactions and collective dissipation, described by a Lindblad master equation. In the thermodynamic limit ($N\to\infty$), a mean-field treatment yields classical equations of motion, whose dynamics are characterized via the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE). Focusing on the thermodynamic limit, we map out chaotic, quasiperiodic, and periodic phases via bifurcation diagrams, MLEs, and Fourier spectra of evolved observables, identifying classic period-doubling bifurcations and fractal boundaries in the regions of attractors. Finite-size quantum simulations in the Dicke basis reveal that while both quantum and classical systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases, finite-size effects suppress some behaviors present in the thermodynamic limit. The sign of $\lambda_{\mathrm{max}}$ serves as a key indicator of convergence between quantum and classical dynamics, which agree over timescales up to the Lyapunov time. Analysis of the density matrix shows that convergence occurs only when its nonzero elements are sharply localized. However, the nonconvergence does not imply a fundamental difference between quantum and classical dynamics: in chaotic regimes, although the evolution orbits of quantum and classical systems show significant differences, quantum evolution becomes mixed and diffusively explores the Hilbert space, signaling quantum chaos, which can be confirmed by the delocalized nature of the density matrix.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00262v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We present a series of experiments investigating the local microstructure of cylindrical piles composed of highly concave particles. By systematically varying particle geometry -- from spheres to strongly non-convex polypods -- as well as frictional properties and the number of branches, we explore how these parameters, together with the preparation protocol, shape the internal structure of the system. Using X-ray tomography combined with a dedicated image-analysis pipeline, we accurately extract the position, orientation, and contacts of every particle in each pile. This allows us to quantify the evolution of key structural observables as a function of particle geometry and preparation method. In particular, we measure the distributions of local packing fraction, coordination number, number of neighbors, and contact locations, along with particle-particle positional and orientational correlations. More importantly, we construct a new stability indicator that correlates perfectly with the observed pile stabilities, enabling us to identify the fundamental mechanisms responsible for \textit{geometrically induced cohesion} in granular systems composed of non-interlocking particle shapes: interdigitation, rotational constraint, friction-mediated cohesion, and the ability of a pile to re-stabilize.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00102v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) is a highly effective optimization technique. A primary challenge when applying CMA-ES in high dimensionality is sampling from a multivariate normal distribution with an arbitrary covariance matrix, which involves its decomposition. The cubic complexity of this process is the main obstacle to applying CMA-ES in highdimensional spaces. We introduce a version of CMA-ES that uses no covariance matrix at all. In the proposed matrix-free CMA-ES, an archive stores the vectors of differences between individuals and the midpoint, normalized by the step size. New individuals are generated as the weighted combinations of the vectors from the archive. We prove that the probability distribution of individuals generated by the proposed method is identical to that of the standard CMA-ES. Experimental results show that reducing the archive size to store only a fixed number of the most recent populations is sufficient, without compromising optimization efficiency. The matrix-free and matrix-based CMA-ES achieve comparable results on the quadratic function when the step-size adaptation is turned off. When coupled with the step-size adaptation method, the matrix-free CMA-ES converges faster than the matrix-based, and usually yields the results of a comparable or superior quality, according to the results obtained for the CEC&#x27;2017 benchmark suite. Presented approach simplifies the algorithm, offers a novel perspective on covariance matrix adaptation, and serves as a stepping stone toward even more efficient methods.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00059v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: We explore the evolution of sub-Neptune (radii between $\sim$1.5 and 4 R$_\oplus$) exoplanet interior structures using our upgraded planetary evolution code, \texttt{APPLE}, which self-consistently couples the thermal and compositional evolution of the whole structure. We incorporate stably stratified regions with convective mixing and, for the first time, ab initio results on the phase separation of silicate-hydrogen mixtures to model silicate rain in sub-Neptune envelopes. We demonstrate that inefficient mantle cooling can retain sufficient heat to Gyr ages: inefficient heat transport from mantle to envelope alone keeps radii $\sim$10\% larger than predicted by adiabatic models at late times. Silicate rain can contribute an additional $\sim$5\% to the radius, depending on envelope mass and initial metal abundance. The silicate-hydrogen immiscibility region may lie in the middle or even upper envelope, far above the envelope-mantle boundary layer, and bifurcates the envelope into two an upper, hydrogen-rich region and a lower, metal-rich region above the mantle. If silicate rain occurs, atmospheres should appear depleted of silicates while radii remain inflated at late ages. To demonstrate this, we present interior evolution models for GJ 1214 b, K2-18 b, TOI-270 d, and TOI-1801 b, showing that hot, liquid silicate mantles with thin envelopes reproduce their radii and mean densities, providing an alternative to water-world interpretations. These results imply that bulk compositions inferred from mean density must account for mantle thermal state and envelope mixing/phase separation history; such thermal ``memories&#x27;&#x27; may constrain formation entropies and temperatures when metallicities are better measured.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This paper develops a Bloch-sphere-based geometric-phase framework for topological vibrations in engineered elastic lattices, with no substantive connection to origins-of-life, astrobiology, habitability, or biosignatures.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2510.11930v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Mechanical lattices support topological wave phenomena governed by geometric phases. We develop a compact Hilbert space description for one-dimensional elastic chains, expressing intra-cell motion as a normalized superposition of orthogonal eigenstates and tracking complex amplitudes as trajectories on a Bloch sphere. For diatomic lattices, this framework makes inversion symmetry protection explicit: the relative phase between in-phase and out-of-phase modes is piecewise locked, and the Zak phase is quantized with band-dependent jumps at symmetry points. Extending the analysis to triatomic lattices shows that restoring inversion retains quantization, whereas breaking it dequantizes the geometric phase while leaving the spectral origin invariant. Viewing norm-preserving transformations of the modal coefficient pair as Bloch sphere rotations, we demonstrate classical analogues of single-qubit logic gates. A pi-phase rotation about a transverse axis swaps the modal poles, and a longitudinal-axis phase flip maps balanced superpositions to their conjugates. These gate-like operations are realized by controlled evolution across wavenumber space and can be driven or reprogrammed through spatiotemporal stiffness modulation. Introducing space-time modulation hybridizes carrier and sideband harmonics, producing continuous phase winding and open-path geometric phases accumulated along the Floquet trajectory. Across static and modulated regimes, the framework unifies algebraic and geometric viewpoints, remains robust to gauge and basis choices, and operates directly on amplitude-phase data. The results clarify how symmetry, modulation, and topology jointly govern dispersion, modal mixing, and phase accumulation, providing tools to analyze and design vibration and acoustic functionalities in engineered structures.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00440v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Culture is not just traits but a dynamic system of interdependent beliefs, practices and artefacts embedded in cognitive, social and material structures. Culture evolves as these entities interact, generating path dependence, attractor states and tension, with long-term stability punctuated by rapid systemic transformations. Cultural learning and creativity is modelled as coherence-seeking information processing: individuals filter, transform and recombine input in light of prior acquisitions and dissonance reduction, thereby creating increasingly structured worldviews. Higher-order traits such as goals, skills, norms and cognitive gadgets act as emergent metafilters that regulate subsequent selection by defining what counts as coherent. Together, these filtering processes self-organise into epistemic niches, echo chambers, polarised groups and institutions that channel information flows and constrain future evolution. In this view, LLMs and recommender algorithms are products of cultural embeddings that now act back on cultural systems by automated filtering and recombination of information, reshaping future dynamics of cultural systems.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00640v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: WASP-107~b is an extremely low-density super-puff exoplanet whose inflated radius and evidence of strong internal heating make it a key target for understanding planetary structure and evolution. Its orbital eccentricity is a critical parameter for testing mechanisms such as tidal heating and high-eccentricity migration, yet previous measurements have remained inconclusive. Due to the large radial velocity jitter caused by stellar activity, and the presence of at least one additional planet in the system, previous radial velocity measurements could not robustly determine the eccentricity of WASP-107~b. Here we combine the new JWST secondary eclipse data with transit timing data from HST, TESS, and JWST to measure the eccentricity of WASP-107~b. Our joint analysis shows that WASP-107~b has an eccentricity of $0.09\pm0.02$, a mass of $0.096\pm0.005 \, M_J$, and an orbital period of $5.721487\pm0.000001$~days. We find the $99.7\%$ lower limit of the eccentricity is about 0.04. These new measurements are consistent with the scenario in which WASP-107~b is in the final stage of high-eccentricity migration. Preliminary estimate shows that eccentricity-driven tidal dissipation can provide a significant contribution to the energy required to sustain the observed radius inflation of WASP-107~b. Our results establish the dynamical status of one of the most intriguing low-density exoplanets known, and offer new insights into its formation and evolution history.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00251v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: As wireless networks continue to evolve, stringent latency and reliability requirements and highly dynamic channels expose fundamental limitations of gNB-centric massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) architectures, motivating a rethinking of the user equipment (UE) role. In response, the UE is transitioning from a passive transceiver into an active entity that directly contributes to system-level performance. In this context, this article examines the evolving role of the UE in mMIMO systems during the transition from fifth-generation (5G) to sixth-generation (6G), bridging third generation partnership project (3GPP) standardization, device implementation, and architectural innovation. Through a chronological review of 3GPP Releases 15 to 19, we highlight the progression of UE functionalities from basic channel state information (CSI) reporting to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based CSI enhancement and UE-initiated beam management. We further examine key implementation challenges, including multi-panel UE (MPUE) architectures, on-device intelligent processing, and energy-efficient operation, and then discuss corresponding architectural innovations under practical constraints. Using digital-twin-based evaluations, we validate the impact of emerging UE-centric functionalities, illustrating that UE-initiated beam reporting improves throughput in realistic mobility scenarios, while a multi-panel architecture enhances link robustness compared with a single-panel UE.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> This paper develops a geometric framework for quantifying the complexity of open-system quantum dynamics via unitary dilations, with no apparent connection to origins-of-life, prebiotic chemistry, biosignatures, or astrobiology.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00735v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Nielsen&#x27;s geometric approach to quantum circuit complexity provides a Riemannian framework for quantifying the cost of implementing unitary (closed--system) dynamics. For open dynamics, however, the reduced evolution is described by quantum channels and admits many inequivalent Stinespring realizations, so any meaningful complexity notion must specify which microscopic resources are counted as accessible and which transformations are regarded as gauge. We introduce and analyze a geometric complexity functional for families of quantum channels based on unitary dilations. We distinguish an implementation-dependent complexity, defined relative to explicit dilation data, from an intrinsic channel complexity obtained by minimizing over a physically motivated class of admissible dilations (e.g. bounded environment dimension, energy or norm constraints, and penalty structures). The functional has a subtractive form: it compares the geometric cost of the total unitary realization with a canonical surrogate term that removes purely environmental contributions. We justify this subtraction from concise postulates, including closed-system consistency, environment-only neutrality, and invariance under dilation gauge transformations that leave the channel unchanged. This leads to a companion quantity, noise complexity, quantifying the loss of geometric complexity relative to a prescribed ideal closed evolution. We establish a coherence-based lower bound for unitary geometric complexity, derive structural properties such as linear time scaling under time-homogeneous dilations, and obtain dissipator--controlled bounds in the Markovian (GKSL/Lindblad) regime under a standard dilation construction. Finally, we illustrate the framework on canonical benchmark noise models, including dephasing, amplitude damping, and depolarizing (Pauli) channels.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Introduces a sequential reservoir computing architecture for efficient high-dimensional spatiotemporal forecasting, but it has no direct connection to origins-of-life, astrobiology, biosignatures, or habitability topics.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00172v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional spatiotemporal systems remains computationally challenging for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models due to gradient-based training and memory bottlenecks. Reservoir Computing (RC) mitigates these challenges by replacing backpropagation with fixed recurrent layers and a convex readout optimization, yet conventional RC architectures still scale poorly with input dimensionality. We introduce a Sequential Reservoir Computing (Sequential RC) architecture that decomposes a large reservoir into a series of smaller, interconnected reservoirs. This design reduces memory and computational costs while preserving long-term temporal dependencies. Using both low-dimensional chaotic systems (Lorenz63) and high-dimensional physical simulations (2D vorticity and shallow-water equations), Sequential RC achieves 15-25% longer valid forecast horizons, 20-30% lower error metrics (SSIM, RMSE), and up to three orders of magnitude lower training cost compared to LSTM and standard RNN baselines. The results demonstrate that Sequential RC maintains the simplicity and efficiency of conventional RC while achieving superior scalability for high-dimensional dynamical systems. This approach provides a practical path toward real-time, energy-efficient forecasting in scientific and engineering applications.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2312.03243v4 Announce Type: replace Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are at the forefront of scientific machine learning, making possible the creation of machine intelligence that is cognizant of physical laws and able to accurately simulate them. However, today&#x27;s PINNs are often trained for a single physics task and require computationally expensive re-training for each new task, even for tasks from similar physics domains. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a pioneering approach to advance the generalizability of PINNs through the framework of Baldwinian evolution. Drawing inspiration from the neurodevelopment of precocial species that have evolved to learn, predict and react quickly to their environment, we envision PINNs that are pre-wired with connection strengths inducing strong biases towards efficient learning of physics. A novel two-stage stochastic programming formulation coupling evolutionary selection pressure (based on proficiency over a distribution of physics tasks) with lifetime learning (to specialize on a sampled subset of those tasks) is proposed to instantiate the Baldwin effect. The evolved Baldwinian-PINNs demonstrate fast and physics-compliant prediction capabilities across a range of empirically challenging problem instances with more than an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy at a fraction of the computation cost compared to state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning methods. For example, when solving the diffusion-reaction equation, a 70x improvement in accuracy was obtained while taking 700x less computational time. This paper thus marks a leap forward in the meta-learning of PINNs as generalizable physics solvers. Sample codes are available at https://github.com/chiuph/Baldwinian-PINN.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00462v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We present a spectroscopic characterization of 580 K dwarfs within 33 pc, observed with the CHIRON echelle spectrograph (R=80,000) on the SMARTS 1.5m telescope. This volume-limited sample is part of the RKSTAR survey of $\sim$4400 K dwarf primaries within 50 pc. Using Empirical SpecMatch and the diagnostic lines H-alpha (6562.8 Angstrom) and Li I (6707.8 Angstrom), we derive stellar properties, activity status, and age indicators calibrated against 35 benchmark K dwarfs with ages from 20 Myr to 5 Gyr. We find that 7.4% (43 stars) exhibit signatures of youth and/or chromospheric activity: 19 stars show lithium absorption indicating ages $&lt;$1 Gyr, and 36 display H$\alpha$ emission. Kinematic analysis using BANYAN $\Sigma$ identifies 8 additional young stars through membership in the AB Doradus moving group and the Hyades cluster, bringing the total young/active population to 8.8% (51 stars). Stellar parameters span 3600--5500 K in \teff, $-$0.60 to $+$0.55 dex in [Fe/H], and $&lt;$10 to $&gt;$25 km s$^{-1}$ in $v\sin i$. A metal-poor population ([Fe/H] $\leq -$0.50 dex) comprises 4\% of the sample. Galactic kinematics place 80% in the thin disk and 18.4% in the thick disk, with one halo member (HD 134439). Young and active stars are predominantly thin disk members, with two thick disk exceptions. Cross-matching with NASA&#x27;s Exoplanet Archive reveals only 7.5% (44 stars) host confirmed planets as of July 2025. Our results identify 529 mature, inactive K dwarfs as prime targets for terrestrial planet searches, providing a crucial resource for exoplanet habitability studies in the solar neighborhood.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2508.21755v2 Announce Type: replace Abstract: This work presents an analysis of semantic communication in the context of First-Order Logic (FOL)-based deduction. Specifically, the receiver holds a set of hypotheses about the State of the World (SotW), while the transmitter has incomplete evidence about the true SotW but lacks access to the ground truth. The transmitter aims to communicate limited information to help the receiver identify the hypothesis most consistent with true SotW. We formulate the objective as approximating the posterior distribution of the transmitter at the receiver. Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation, this reduces to a constrained, finite-horizon resource allocation problem. Applying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions yields a truncated water-filling solution. Despite the problem&#x27;s non-convexity, symmetry and permutation invariance ensure global optimality. Based on this, we design message selection strategies, both for single- and multi- round communication, and model the receiver&#x27;s inference as an $m$-ary Bayesian hypothesis testing problem. Under the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) rule, our communication strategy achieves optimal performance within budget constraints. We further analyze convergence rates and validate the theoretical findings through experiments, demonstrating reduced error over random selection and prior methods.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2501.17192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: Many mathematical models for biological phenomena, such as the spread of diseases, are based on reaction-diffusion equations for densities of interacting cell populations. We present a consistent derivation of reaction-diffusion equations from systems of suitably rescaled kinetic Boltzmann equations for distribution functions of cell populations interacting in a host medium. We show at first that the classical diffusive limit of kinetic equations leads to linear diffusion terms only. Then, we show possible strategies in order to obtain, from the kinetic level, macroscopic systems with nonlinear diffusion and also with cross-diffusion effects. The derivation from a kinetic description has the advantage of relating reaction and diffusion coefficients to the microscopic parameters of the interactions. We present an application of our approach to the study of the evolution of different bacterial populations on a leaf surface. Turing instability properties of the relevant macroscopic systems are investigated by analytical methods and numerical tools, with particular emphasis on pattern formation for varying parameters in two-dimensional space domains.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00742v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: This perspective explores the evolution of materials informatics, from its foundational roots in physics and information theory to its maturation through artificial intelligence (AI). We trace the field&#x27;s trajectory from early milestones to the transformative impact of the Materials Genome Initiative and the recent advent of large language models (LLMs). Rather than a mere toolkit, we present materials informatics as an evolving ecosystem, reviewing key methodologies such as Bayesian Optimization, Reinforcement Learning, and Transformers that drive inverse design and autonomous self-driving laboratories. We specifically address the practical challenges of LLM integration, comparing specialist versus generalist models and discussing solutions for uncertainty quantification. Looking forward, we assess the transition of AI from a predictive tool to a collaborative research partner. By leveraging active learning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), the field is moving toward a new era of autonomous materials science, increasingly characterized by &quot;human-out-of-the-loop&quot; discovery processes.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00515v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Assembly theory (AT) introduces a concept of causation as a material property, constitutive of a metrology of evolution and selection. The physical scale for causation is quantified with the assembly index, defined as the minimum number of steps necessary for a distinguishable object to exist, where steps are assembled recursively. Observing countable copies of high assembly index objects indicates that a mechanism to produce them is persistent, such that the object&#x27;s environment builds a memory that traps causation within a contingent chain. Copy number and assembly index underlie the standardized metrology for detecting causation (assembly index), and evidence of contingency (copy number). Together, these allow the precise definition of a selective threshold in assembly space, understood as the set of all causal possibilities. This threshold demarcates life (and its derivative agential, intelligent and technological forms) as structures with persistent copies beyond the threshold. In introducing a fundamental concept of material causation to explain and measure life, AT represents a departure from prior theories of causation, such as interventional ones, which have so far proven incompatible with fundamental physics. We discuss how AT&#x27;s concept of causation provides the foundation for a theory of physics where novelty, contingency and the potential for open-endedness are fundamental, and determinism is emergent along assembled lineages.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00619v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Cobalt-free high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have garnered interest for nuclear structural applications due to their good mechanical performance, thermal stability, and resistance to radiation-induced degradation, while avoiding long-lived Co radioisotopes. This study presents an experimental and computational investigation of the plastic deformation behavior of a non-equatomic CrMnFeNi alloy, designed to maintain a stability of fcc phase in a large domain of temperatures and to balance stacking fault (SF) energies for enhanced strain hardening and ductility. Tensile tests reveal a temperature-dependent reduction in mechanical strength, attributed to thermally activated deformation mechanisms and microstructural evolution. Molecular dynamics simulations of single- and polycrystals capture dislocation activity, SF formation, and twin nucleation as a function of strain and temperature. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) confirms twin formation and grain boundary activity. The Schmid factor mapping is drawn to interpret local slip activity and anisotropic deformation behavior. The absence of Co leads to enhanced high-temperature strength compared to the Cantor alloy.</p>

Being able to distinguish the traces of biological activity from geological self-organization is fundamental both for understanding the origin of life on Earth and for the search for life beyond Earth.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00161v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: We present an NPT extension of Ewald summation with prolates (ESP), a spectrally accurate and scalable particle-mesh method for molecular dynamics simulations of periodic, charged systems. Building on the recently introduced ESP framework, this work focuses on rigorous and thermodynamically consistent pressure/stress evaluation in the isothermal--isobaric ensemble. ESP employs prolate spheroidal wave functions as both splitting and spreading kernels, reducing the Fourier grid size needed to reach a prescribed pressure accuracy compared with current widely used mesh-Ewald methods based on Gaussian splitting and B-spline spreading. We derive a unified pressure-tensor formulation applicable to isotropic, semi-isotropic, anisotropic, and fully flexible cells, and show that the long-range pressure can be evaluated with a single forward FFT followed by diagonal scaling, whereas force evaluation requires both forward and inverse transforms. We provide production implementations in LAMMPS and GROMACS and validate pressure and force accuracy on bulk water, LiTFSI ionic liquids, and a transmembrane system. Benchmarks on up to $3\times 10^3$ CPU cores demonstrate strong scaling and reduced communication cost at matched accuracy, particularly for NPT pressure evaluation.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00757v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: The outbreak of mutant strains and vaccination behaviors have been the focus of recent epidemiological research, but most existing epidemic models failed to simultaneously capture viral mutation and consider the complexity and behavioral dynamics of vaccination. To address this gap, we develop an extended SIRS model that distinguishes infections with the original strain and a mutant strain, and explicitly introduces a vaccinated compartment state. At the behavioral level, we employ evolutionary game theory to model individual vaccination decisions, where strategies are determined by both neighbors&#x27; choices and the current epidemiological situation. This process corresponds to the time-varying vaccination rate of susceptible individuals transitioning to vaccinated individuals at the epidemic spreading level. We then couple the epidemic and vaccination behavioral processes through the microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA) and finally investigate the evolutionary dynamics via numerical simulations. The results show that our framework can effectively mitigate outbreaks across different disease scenarios. Sensitivity analysis further reveals that vaccination uptake is most strongly influenced by vaccine cost, efficacy, and perceived risk of side effects. Overall, this behavior-aware modeling framework captures the co-evolution of viral mutation and vaccination behavior, providing quantitative and theoretical support for designing effective public health vaccination policies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00431v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: This work provides an alternative derivation of third order response functions in four wave mixing spectroscopy of multichromophoric macromolecular systems considering only single exciton states. For the case of harmonic oscillator bath linearly and diagonally coupled to exciton states, closed form expressions showing all the explicit time dependences are derived. These expressions can provide more solid physical basis for understanding 2-dimensional electronic spectroscopy signals. For more general cases of system-bath coupling, the quantum master equation (QME) approach is employed for the derivation of multistep time evolution equations for Green function-like operators. Solution of these equations is feasible at the level of 2nd order non-Markovian QME, and the new approach can account for inter-exciton coupling, dephasing, relaxation, and non-Markovian effects in a consistent manner.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> arXiv:2601.00323v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Both abiotic self-organization and biological mechanisms have been put forward as the origin of a number of geological patterns. It is important to comprehend the formation mechanisms of such structures both to understand geological self-organization and in order to differentiate them from biological patterns -- fossils and bio-influenced structures -- seen in geological systems. Being able to distinguish the traces of biological activity from geological self-organization is fundamental both for understanding the origin of life on Earth and for the search for life beyond Earth.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Computational prediction of CRISPR-Cas9 off-target activity is a critical step toward the safe and scalable design of guide RNAs. Most existing deep learning models are trained on large proxy datasets derived from high-throughput assays; however, their performance often degrades when evaluated on experimentally validated off-target sites. This limitation raises concerns about the generalization ability of proxy-trained models and highlights the need for architectures that better transfer to biologically relevant benchmarks such as TrueOT. We propose a two-stage deep learning framework that decouples sequence representation learning from off-target classification. In the first stage, guide RNA sequences are encoded using pretrained transformer-based embeddings learned from large genomic corpora. In the second stage, a hybrid neural network integrates these embeddings with mismatch-level and sequence-pair features to predict off-target activity. Models are trained exclusively on a proxy dataset and evaluated under strict external validation on the TrueOT benchmark. Our results show that incorporating pretrained sequence embeddings substantially improves generalization performance. The full two-stage model achieves consistent improvements in ROC-AUC and PR-AUC on TrueOT, relative to proxy-only baselines, across repeated runs. We demonstrate a consistent generalization effect under distribution shift, robust to training noise, seeds, and evaluation variance. These findings provide empirical evidence that representation transfer plays a critical role in bridging the gap between proxy assay data and experimentally validated off-target behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) with epoxy is useful to enhance the mechanical toughness of 3D-printable epoxy inks. Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) like 1-Ethyl-3-Methylimidazolium dicyanamide ([EMIM][DCA]) have enhanced the self-assembly of pure BCP, enabling the formation of a controlled nanostructure. However, the mechanistic details of the morphological transitions of BCP to nanostructures in the presence of ILs remain unresolved. Here, we developed a coarse-grained (CG) model for a certain class of BCPs, namely Pluronic P123 in [EMIM][DCA] ionic liquid, to investigate the underlying mechanism beyond nanostructure transition of BCPs under varying temperature and composition. At various Pluronic compositions (20-60 wt%), P123 self-aggregates into spherical, cylindrical, and lamellar nanostructures, confirmed by visual inspection and quantitative metrics. An increase in the concentration of Pluronic leads to the formation of a more favorable self-interaction, resulting in a more ordered, lamellar-shaped aggregate. We suggest that morphological changes of nanostructure are governed by the balance between entropic and enthalpic factors. In a higher ordered shape (lamellar phase), enthalpic dominates, while in spherical-shaped micelles, both entropic and enthalpic are equivalent. Our CG model of PEO and PPO beads can be used to investigate the BCPs phase separation and will further help to understand the thermodynamics of self-aggregation for other BCPs in IL medium. This study will guide the acceleration of the discovery process for advanced 3D printable materials, including Pluronic P123 or other Pluronic materials.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> TiO2–reduced graphene oxide (rGO) hybrids were investigated in this study to elucidate how TiO2 morphology and surface chemistry govern charge-transfer pathways and, ultimately, reaction selectivity. Three anatase TiO2 nanostructures were compared: bipyramids predominantly exposing {101} facets (bipy) and two nanosheet-like samples enriched in {001} facets, either fluorinated (n-sh) or thermally defluorinated and {101}-enriched (n-sh_873K). A constant rGO loading (2 wt.%) was introduced via in situ hydrazine reduction of graphene oxide in the presence of TiO2. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated under Xe-lamp irradiation in two model reactions probing oxidative and reductive pathways: phenol degradation and H2 evolution using formic acid as a scavenger. rGO systematically enhanced phenol degradation for all morphologies, with bipy+rGO showing the highest activity. In contrast, H2 evolution was consistently suppressed upon rGO incorporation across all TiO2 samples, although the bipyramidal morphology remained the most active within each series. These results highlight that facet exposure and surface functionalization dictate the beneficial or detrimental role of rGO depending on the targeted photocatalytic pathway.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> All-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) attracted increasing attention due to their improved safety and energy densities; yet electrolyte decomposition and subsequent contact loss limited the interfacial stability of ASSBs. Herein, we report an operando Raman characterization that provides high voltage, time, and spatial resolutions, which enables simultaneous analysis of interfacial decomposition mechanism and morphological evolution. Using Na3SbS4 electrolyte (NSS) and its carboxymethyl-cellulose-encapsulated analogue (NSS-CMC) as exemplars, we precisely contrasted the subtle differences in the two-step reduction mechanism of the two electrolytes. In both systems, Na3SbS3 formed as an intermediate, and Na3Sb binary as one major final product; while the CMC coating altered the kinetics of Na3SbS3 formation and consumption, and extended the formation potential of Na3Sb from 1.35 V (seen in NSS) to 0.50 V (vs. Na/Na+). Oxidation of NSS and NSS-CMC both occur near 2.20 V, although CMC coating altered the crystallinity of the oxidative products. Simultaneously, we captured phenomena that are unique to solid-state electrochemical systems such as particle relocation, morphological change, and reversed reactions. We inferred CMC’s dual role as a voltage barrier and a mechanical buffer in suppressing the electro-chemo-mechanical decomposition of NSS electrolyte. The deep mechanistic insights unravel the exact modification needed for improved interfacial stability.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Electrochemical nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO₃RR → NH₃) suffers from poor selectivity and strong competition from hydrogen evolution. Here we show that materials-intrinsic electrostatic reprogramming of colloidal copper nitride (Cu₃N) nanocrystals provides a robust lever to bias NO₃RR. Two routes are established in a single electrolyte (0.50 M KNO₃ + 0.10 M KOH): (i) dilute Na incorporation that preserves the anti-ReO₃ (Pm-3m) lattice with small peak shifts, and (ii) Li treatment that amorphizes Cu₃N, yielding short-range–ordered Li–Cu–N. Across both families, cyclic voltammetry, LSV/Tafel analysis, and impedance spectroscopy reveal earlier cathodic onset (≈60–120 mV), reduced charge-transfer resistance (R_ct down to ~16 Ω from ~79 Ω for pristine), and favorable potential-of-zero-charge (PZC) shifts within the operating window. Chronoamperometry with indophenol quantification gives Faradaic efficiencies up to 74% and NH₃ production rates up to 8.8 × 10⁻³ mmol h⁻¹ mg⁻¹ (10% Li–Cu–N), with Tafel slopes of 120–167 mV dec⁻¹, consistent with a first electron-transfer step as rate determining. Electrolyte-cation spike and rinse–swap controls decouple double-layer effects from materials changes: gains on undoped Cu₃N vanish after rinsing, whereas Na-modified and Li-amorphous electrodes retain performance. The results delineate two complementary design paradigms lattice-level Na incorporation and controlled Li-induced amorphization that embed a beneficial interfacial field and accelerate NO₃RR without reactor or electrolyte redesign.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Nipah virus (NiV) represents a catastrophic public health risk to the Indian subcontinent, as evidenced by recurring outbreaks in Kerala (2018, 2021, 2023) where case fatality rates reached as high as 70-90%. There are currently no clinically approved therapeutics or vaccines specifically for NiV. A major hurdle in the drug development pipeline is the high mutation rate of RNA viruses, which allows them to rapidly evolve resistance against site-specific inhibitors. This research project utilizes a multi-layered computational strategy to identify a small-molecule inhibitor capable of targeting the viral polymerase while maintaining efficacy against the predicted high-probability W730A resistance mutation. Through a first-principles assessment of the viral polymerase structure (PDB: 9KNZ), I established a design constraint called Allosteric Independence. This requires any lead candidate to bind in a pocket that is geometrically distinct from the mutation site W730, thereby preventing steric or electronic disruption upon mutation. After screening a library of 50 high-potential candidates using a rigid-receptor docking protocol, I identified BMS-986205 (Linrodostat), an investigational IDO1 inhibitor, as a superior lead. BMS-986205 demonstrated a binding affinity of -7.17 kcal/mol against the wild-type polymerase and a paradoxical increase to -7.29 kcal/mol against the W730A mutant. Geometric analysis confirmed a physical separation of 6.28 Å from the mutation site. Given its current status in global Phase 3 clinical trials for oncology, BMS-986205 is a primary candidate for rapid drug repurposing to secure India’s population against future outbreaks.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Molecular dynamics simulations on GPUs have historically required a trade-off between performance and numerical precision. Mixed-precision approaches, such as AMBER SPFP and OpenMM, accumulate forces in high precision while representing coordinates in single precision (FP32). This design introduces a fundamental “noise floor”: quantization error in FP32 coordinates injects artificial heat into the system, degrading long-term stability and distorting kinetic properties. We introduce MINT32, a coordinate representation that maps the simulation box onto a 32-bit integer grid. MINT32 achieves a spatial resolution of approximately 0.01 fm, roughly 300 times finer than FP32, without the memory bandwidth penalties associated with 64-bit integer arithmetic. In addition, MINT32 offers algorithmic elegance through self-wrapping, whereby periodic boundary conditions are enforced via exact integer overflow, eliminating branch divergence entirely. Benchmark results demonstrate that MINT32 reduces energy drift in microcanonical (NVE) simulations by nearly an order of magnitude (7--10x), delivering double-precision-level stability for challenging PME water systems. When paired with single-precision force evaluations, MINT32 outperforms conventional mixed-precision models, indicating that coordinate precision is the dominant factor governing simulation stability in the systems examined. The fixed-point grid further enables constraint solvers (SHAKE) to converge to tolerances of 10A, effectively eliminating constraint instabilities. Our implementation achieves approximately 85\% of production throughput on consumer-grade GPUs, serving as a conceptual foundation for future molecular dynamics (MD) engines. The primary objective of this study is to identify an optimal coordinate representation for next-generation MD software. To this end, we present a prototype framework designed to isolate and evaluate the numerical behavior of coordinate representations in molecular dynamics, with a modified version of the AMBER simulation package serving solely as a testbed.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Chiral non-benzenoid nanographenes remain highly appealing but underexplored synthetic targets due to the lack of feasible synthetic strategies to simultaneously construct non-hexagonal rings and stable chirality. Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of a novel chiral saddle-shaped nanographene (cSNG) incorporating two heptagon-embedded [4]helicenes. The structure of cSNG is unambiguously confirmed by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, demonstrating its flexible π-skeleton. Due to the heptagon-embedded [4]helicene subunits, cSNG exists as configurationally stable enantiomers, which enable chiral resolution and lead to pronounced chiroptical responses. Remarkably, the chiral saddle-shaped framework presents strong host–guest interactions with fullerenes C60 and C70, which were investigated via several titration methods. The association constants for a 1:1 complex, determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy titration (Ka(C60) = 2.3 × 104 M-1; Ka(C70) = 8.7 × 104 M-1), are among the highest values reported for negatively curved nanographenes. Moreover, crystallographic analysis of cocrystals of cSNG with C60 revealed a 1:3 binding mode for supramolecular complexation, featuring two fullerenes accommodated inside the saddle cavity as well as two shared fullerenes located on each concave outward facing side.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Molecular mechanisms governing initiation steps of the assembly of thousands of endogenous multi-protein complexes (EMCs) remain incompletely understood. Here, multiple lines of observations are reported reflecting the biological functions-aligned initiation sequence of hybrid assembly pathways (HAPs) of EMCs. HAPs postulate the creation of cell type-specific intracellular pools of hetero- and homodimers as the first step of chain reactions of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of EMCs’ assemblies. The consensus action sequence of HAPs consists of: a) Initiation on genomic DNA templates of the formation of metastable hetero- and homodimers of EMCs’ protein constituents; b) Release of dimers from DNA templates for delivery to the EMCs assembly compartments; c) Assembly of defined EMCs by sequential on demand addition to preformed dimers serving as attractors of EMC-specific monomers’ ensembles. Chromosome-naïve scaffolds of PPIs contributing to creation of intracellular dimer pools constitute genome-wide networks of binding sites for 716 transcription factors (TFs), 534 of which manifest patterns of significantly enriched expression in 1358 brain regions. The initiators’ loci of HAPs appear to operate within nucleosome-depleted islands of transposable elements (TE) – derived sequences within transcriptionally silent heterochromatin. Performance of PPI DNA template-guided assembly lines of EMCs is illustrated in two concurrent modes of PPI cascades: TF-TF PPI chains and TF-PPI Hub protein chains. Regardless of the number of DNA-bound TFs initiating the multistep PPI sequences at PPI initiators (ranging from one to 716 TFs), both modes of operations reached the equilibrium at the PPI constituents saturation levels of ~245 proteins for TF-TF PPI and of ~351 proteins for TF-PPI Hub Proteins’ assembly chains. Regardless of TF panels bound at HAP initiators, proteins of PPI-guided ensembles are enriched in either defined sets of neuroanatomical structures (TF-TF PPI path) or among structural-functional constituents of synapses (PPI Hub proteins path). Examples of default operation modes of DNA-template-guided assemblies of hetero- and homodimers of Yamanaka factors, neurogenesis constituents, and principal protein components of postsynaptic density of excitatory and inhibitory synaptogenesis are reported. Altogether, this contribution reports the foundational evidence for further experimental and theoretical explorations of retrotransposon-seeded genome-wide codes for initiators of PPI chain reactions of protein dimerization creating pools of attractors to guide and accelerate the EMC assemblies.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is a nonionic and highly water-soluble polymer, and PEGylation is widely used as a versatile chemical strategy to enhance the water solubility of otherwise poorly soluble molecules. The rational design of PEG-appended materials, therefore, requires an estimation of the PEG chain length necessary to achieve the desired level of solubility. Here, we investigated the relationship between the PEG chain length and the water solubility of PEG-appended molecules using a combination of experimental and computational approaches. We focused on monodisperse PEG with a discrete molecular weight, which enables us to identify the relationship between chain length and physicochemical properties, as represented by water solubility. Then, we designed a series of PEG‑appended molecules bearing monodisperse PEG chains of varying lengths, and measured their water solubilities experimentally. In parallel, molecular dynamics-based alchemical free‑energy calculations yielded thermodynamic trends that reproduced the observed dependence of solubility on PEG chain length. Comparison of experimental and computational results showed that the calculations not only distinguished between water-soluble and insoluble PEG-appended molecules but also captured the solubility trends for moderately soluble species. These findings demonstrate the potential of molecular-dynamics-based free-energy calculations for a priori prediction of the water solubility of PEG-appended molecules.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> G-quadruplex (G4) structures within oncogene promoters represent promising therapeutic targets, particularly in the context of transcriptional regulation. Here, we report that the Red box, a fully organic macrocyclic cationic receptor, exhibits high-affinity and selectivity for G4 structures. Biophysical analyses reveal that the Red box binds the c-MYC G4 with nanomolar affinity, stronger than most reported c-MYC ligands. Notably, the Red box displays greater selectivity for c-MYC over duplex DNA compared to the well-characterized porphyrin TMPyP4 and its macrocyclic architecture is essential for this activity, as its acyclic analogue displays negligible G4 stabilization. In cellular assays, treatment with non-cytotoxic concentrations of the Red box selectively downregulated c-MYC expression in HEK293T cells, with minimal effects on c-KIT and hTERT. Furthermore, c-MYC suppression was proportional to its basal expression across several cell lines, supporting a G4-mediated mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Successive maturation of ribosomal subunits occurs through multi-layered phase-separated structures of the cell nucleolus. The spatio-functional relationship between transcription of rRNA and nucleolar substructures and how this adapts to cellular stress remain incompletely understood. In this study, we resolve the sub nucleolar structures using expansion microscopy to reveal ordered structures of fibrillar center (FC) and dense fibrillar component (DFC) domains as nested shells, which is reorganized upon cellular stress like DNA damage or RNA polymerase I (RNAPI) inhibition. Direct visualization of nascent (5&#x27; ETS) and mature (28S) rRNA suggested that rRNA synthesis is the critical regulator of nucleolar size, and organization. Nucleolar reorganization upon stress emerges to be a direct function of nascent rRNA levels. Stress-induced transcription inhibition remodels the sub-nucleolar compartments from a viscoelastic state into solid-like condensates thereby perturbing the nucleolar pH gradient due to the missing rRNA scaffold. We show, that rather than signalling to mediate rDNA repair, nucleolar reorganization naturally arises primarily from reduced rRNA levels and the resultant biophysical restructuring of the nucleolus under cellular stress.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>AI Decision:</strong> Presents a moments-based statistical framework to infer transcriptional regulation kinetics from single-cell nascent RNA measurements, improving model selection and parameter estimation over mature mRNA-based approaches in yeast and E. coli.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Unraveling the kinetics of transcriptional regulation is a central challenge in molecular biology. Traditional inference methods based on cell-to-cell mRNA variability are limited because mRNA levels reflect not only transcriptional activity but also post-transcriptional processes. Recent advances in quantifying nascent RNAs across isogenic cells provide a more direct readout of transcriptional dynamics. Here, we present a moments-based theoretical framework that leverages nascent RNA data to infer transcriptional kinetics. We derive closed-form expressions for the first two time-dependent moments of nascent RNA across three canonical transcription models and demonstrate that nascent RNA exhibits distinct transient overshoots and higher Fano factors compared to mature mRNA. Through analysis of synthetic datasets, we show that these features enable more accurate estimation of transcriptional kinetics and allow reliable model selection, distinguishing single from multi-pathway promoter activation with over 75% accuracy even from small sample sizes. We further validated our model selection method using real experimental transcription datasets in yeast and E. coli cells, with nascent RNA demonstrating superior performance in identifying cross-talk pathway regulation. Our framework thus offers a computationally efficient and mechanistically informative approach for decoding transcriptional dynamics, emphasizing the advantages of time-dependent nascent RNA measurements over mature mRNA in capturing the true kinetics of transcriptional regulation.</p>
