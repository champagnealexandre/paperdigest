    <summary>A cultural essay recommending books about clubbing and nightlife history, with no connection to origins of life, astrobiology, or related prebiotic chemistry topics.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    There are nights when the dance floor beckons but the bones refuse. When the urge to party arrives, it may be too late to book a babysitter. Perhaps you’re already in sweatpants, or closing time is before midnight where you live. Possibly, the prospect of going out has been raised but vetoed by a cohabitant, and you don’t want to tango alone. You could also be the kind of person who is more interested in the idea than the reality of loud, sweaty, euphoric congresses found in clubs and music venues. Fortunately, mood-altering substances are available at home—by which, of course, I mean books. A rich literature on pleasure-oriented nightlife is available for consultation or consolation on your evening in. These five books offer a bit of vicarious sweat and thrill to get you as close to the experience as possible without demanding that you leave your couch. They also invite readers to think more expansively about what exactly draws so many people to mingle in the dark—the club’s human stakes, its sensory pleasures, and its illuminating social history. Reading a good book is not the same as riding a social high into the wee hours, but it may equip you with a sense of possibility that you can apply far beyond the coatroom. On the right night, wise women attest , a DJ can save your life. The Haçienda: How Not to Run a Club , by Peter Hook The Haçienda in Manchester was a catalyst of the U.K. acid house scene in the late ’80s, and a prophecy foretold: “The h açienda must be built,” the Situationist poet Ivan Chtcheglov wrote in 1953. Heeding these cryptic words some three decades later, the audacious (and well-read) impresario Tony Wilson opened the Haçienda together with the circle of post-punk musicians and designers involved with his label, Factory Records. Their attempt to decipher Chtcheglov’s mystical phrase lasted 15 years. Hook, the bassist for New Order, served as a kind of player-coach at the Haçienda, helping manage its madcap affairs while his band became the club’s cash cow. In this memoir of misbegotten business administration, Hook returns to the storied nights out that changed British culture even as they threatened to bankrupt him—and worse. Beset by gangs and guns, the Haçienda faltered in the ’90s despite clever-sounding schemes such as replacing the club’s security with the gangsters themselves. This is a scrapbook of utopian folly, yes, but also an insider’s look at what was, for a time, the wildest workplace on Earth. Love Saves the Day: A History of American Dance Music Culture, 1970–1979 , by Tim Lawrence “Disco sucks” was the cry of philistines, if not bigots, Lawrence argues. In this meticulous but inviting cultural history of New York nightlife in the 1970s, he follows disco’s rise from underground clubs such as the Loft to the vaunted lights of Studio 54 and the FM airwaves of American suburbs. Versions of this story have been told before, but what distinguishes Love Saves the Day are the more than 300 interviews Lawrence conducted with promoters, partiers, and legendary DJs such as Frankie Knuckles . It’s full of wisdom from the elders of American club culture: how to stagger straight and gay crowds on a Friday night, how to find the next great floor-filling single, how to build a DJ set like a furnace that can burn all night. Lawrence also folds in a number of select club “discographies” so you can reproduce Jimmy Stuard’s set from 12 West, circa 1976, at home (on nice speakers, perhaps, or an iPhone placed in a cereal bowl). [ Read: Partying feels different now ] Bright Lights, Big City , by Jay McInerney Some might say McInerney’s debut novel reads a bit long in the tooth four decades after it first offered the curious public a glimpse of Manhattan-yuppie hedonism. Still, no syllabus on clubbing could be complete without the opening chapter’s rendering of the dislocation and dread that may await the partygoer “on that imperceptible pivot where two A.M. changes to six A.M.” For the nameless protagonist—a young fact-checker recently separated from his wife—a punishing club itinerary provides the opposite of community and connection. Something important is being avoided, in fact, on the dance floor and in the many crowded bathroom stalls where lines of “Bolivian Marching Powder” are hungrily apportioned. Beyond its glitz and sleaze, Bright Lights is a sobering lesson on why partying does not always soothe a troubled soul. Legendary: Inside the House Ballroom Scene , by Gerard H. Gaskin One of the older photographs in Gaskin’s book, from 1998, finds an impeccably suited ballroom performer strutting the boards of what appears to be a community-center gymnasium. Scanning from head to toe, the viewer sees a banded fedora, cigar, jacket and trousers, and, finally, holding it all up (easily missed at first glance): vertiginously high stilettos. It’s an image of heroic poise, accentuated by the look of enchantment on the faces of a trio of young men watching from folding chairs. Gaskin has long enjoyed a reputation as the “Trinidadian Andy Warhol” of the ballroom scene in New York City, writes the scholar Frank Roberts, a subject of Gaskin’s; for those who performed in that world between the mid-1990s and the early 2010s, when these photos were taken, appearing in a Gaskin portrait was a “rite of passage.” His pictures illustrate the drama and grandeur of these events, but they also convey the importance of the club as a place where dignity—elsewhere denied—may be claimed without apology, and freedom can be realized for the length of the catwalk. [ Read: The coronavirus is testing queer culture ] Raving , by McKenzie Wark Wark’s sprawling intelligence is a pleasure to access on any subject. In Raving , Wark blends autofiction and theory to chaperone the reader through the trans rave scene in New York City—or at least the scene as she found it in the years before and after 2020. “First thing I look for at raves: who needs it,” she writes of these parties, “and among those who need it, who can handle their habit?” Vividly told, Raving is no gawking ethnography; it’s a sticky and tender little book with serious ethical contemplation at its center. Wark is attentive to the essence of raving as a Black art form and its special significance for queer people, but she approaches it as an activity open to anyone who can handle it—not a way of life so much as a way of creating new lives together.

    Entropy, Vol. 28, Pages 55: The KPZ Equation of Kinetic Interface Roughening: A Variational Perspective Entropy doi: 10.3390/e28010055 Authors: Horacio S. Wio Roberto R. Deza Jorge A. Revelli Rafael Gallego Reinaldo García-García Miguel A. Rodríguez Interfaces of rather different natures&amp;amp;mdash;as, e.g., bacterial colony or forest fire boundaries, or semiconductor layers grown by different methods (MBE, sputtering, etc.)&amp;amp;mdash;are self-affine fractals, and feature scaling with universal exponents (depending on the substrate&amp;amp;rsquo;s dimensionality d and global topology, as well as on the driving randomness&amp;amp;rsquo; spatial and temporal correlations but not on the underlying mechanisms). Adding lateral growth as an essential (non-equilibrium) ingredient to the known equilibrium ones (randomness and interface relaxation), the Kardar&amp;amp;ndash;Parisi&amp;amp;ndash;Zhang (KPZ) equation succeeded in finding (via the dynamic renormalization group) the correct exponents for flat d=1 substrates and (spatially and temporally) uncorrelated randomness. It is this interplay which gives rise to the unique, non-Gaussian scaling properties characteristic of the specific, universal type of non-equilibrium roughening. Later on, the asymptotic statistics of process h(x) fluctuations in the scaling regime was also analytically found for d=1 substrates. For d&amp;amp;gt;1 substrates, however, one has to rely on numerical simulations. Here we review a variational approach that allows for analytical progress regardless of substrate dimensionality. After reviewing our previous numerical results in d=1, 2, and 3 on the time evolution of one of the functionals&amp;amp;mdash;which we call the non-equilibrium potential (NEP)&amp;amp;mdash;as well as its scaling behavior with the nonlinearity parameter &amp;amp;lambda;, we discuss the stochastic thermodynamics of the roughening process and the memory of process h(x) in KPZ and in the related Golubovi&amp;amp;#263;&amp;amp;ndash;Bruinsma (GB) model, providing numerical evidence for the significant dependence on initial conditions of the NEP&amp;amp;rsquo;s asymptotic behavior in both models. Finally, we highlight some open questions.

    <summary>CRISPR-engineered human stem cell–derived islets show that a protective IFIH1 (MDA5) truncation variant dampens dsRNA-driven interferon responses, reducing stress, apoptosis, and dysfunction under viral and inflammatory challenges in a type 1 diabetes background.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked dozens of genetic loci to type 1 diabetes (T1D). The IFIH1 gene, which encodes the double-stranded RNA sensor MDA5, is one such locus. The E627* single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in IFIH1 is associated with protection against T1D, while the A946T variant is linked to increased risk. While the E627* variant has been shown to result in a truncated protein and dampen type I interferon (IFN) signaling, its specific role in human pancreatic islet health and function remains unclear. We hypothesized that MDA5627* would protect islet cells from stress-induced dysfunction, identity loss, and cell death. Using CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we introduced the E627* and A946T variants into human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) derived from a T1D patient. We differentiated these hPSCs into stem cell-derived islets (SC-islets) and treated them with IFN, poly(I:C), and coxsackievirus B3, an enterovirus implicated in T1D pathogenesis. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and an array of functional assays, we investigated the variant impact on both whole SC-islets and their individual cell populations. Our analysis revealed that SC-islets, and their {beta}, , and {delta} cell subpopulations, harboring the MDA5627* variant exhibit an attenuated immune response to the various stressors compared to MDA5946T cells. We also report unique, cell-type-specific transcriptional responses that vary across variants. Notably, MDA5627* SC-islets showed reduced apoptosis rates and viral genome expression, as well as attenuated negative effects on mitochondrial function and insulin secretion in response to stress. Overall, our findings demonstrate that a clinically relevant MDA5 variant confers protection by dampening stress-mediated transcriptional responses, reducing cell dysfunction, and preventing apoptosis. These insights provide a mechanistic framework for understanding T1D pathogenesis and offer new avenues for developing preventative therapies.

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Environmental change doesn’t affect evolution in a single, predictable way. In large-scale computer simulations, scientists discovered that some fluctuating conditions help populations evolve higher fitness, while others slow or even derail progress. Two populations facing different kinds of change can end up on completely different evolutionary paths. The findings challenge the idea that one population’s response can represent a whole species.

    <summary>A bibliometric analysis using OpenAlex metadata finds near-universal growth in journal internationalization and shifting foci in multidisciplinary journals over the last century, offering meta-level context for how interdisciplinary fields like origins-of-life research may evolve.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    There is a widely held perception that science is becoming more international—through multi-national collaborations—and interdisciplinary, drawing on knowledge from multiple domains. However, these hypothesized trends have not yet been quantitatively characterized. With the publication metadata from OpenAlex, we examine trends in two groups of journals: disciplinary journals in natural sciences, life sciences, social sciences, and multidisciplinary journals that publish articles in multiple fields. Supporting existing perceptions, we find an almost universal trend towards increasing internationalization of both sets of journals. Nevertheless, we find disparities: medicine journals are less international than journals in other disciplines and do not increase their levels of internationalization, whereas physics journals appear to be segregating between those that are international and those that are not. We also find that multidisciplinary journals have undergone significant shifts in their disciplinary focuses over the past century, whereas disciplinary journals appear to have largely maintained their degree of interdisciplinarity.

    <summary>Develops an automated, hierarchical Life Identification Number (LIN) code system based on core-genome MLST to robustly name and compare highly recombining Neisseria gonorrhoeae lineages for surveillance and antibiotic-resistance epidemiology.</summary>

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Investigation of the bacterial pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae is complicated by extensive horizontal gene transfer: a process which disrupts phylogenetic signals and impedes our understanding of population structure. The ability to consistently identify N. gonorrhoeae lineages is important for surveillance of this increasingly antimicrobial resistant organism, facilitating efficient communication regarding its epidemiology; however, conventional typing systems fail to reflect N. gonorrhoeae strain taxonomy in a reliable and stable manner. Here, a N. gonorrhoeae genomic lineage nomenclature, based on the barcoding system of Life Identification Number (LIN) codes, was developed using a refined 1430 core gene MLST (cgMLST). This hierarchical LIN code nomenclature conveys lineage information at multiple levels of resolution within one code, enabling it to provide immediate context to an isolate’s ancestry, and to relate to familiar, previously used typing schemes such as Ng cgMLST v1, 7-locus MLST, or NG-STAR clonal complex (CC). Clustering with LIN codes accurately reflects gonococcal diversity and population structure, providing insight into associations between genotype and phenotype for traits such as antibiotic resistance. These codes are automatically assigned and publicly accessible via the https://pubmlst.org/organisms/neisseria-spp database.

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Scientists in China have performed an experiment first proposed by Albert Einstein almost a century ago when he sought to disprove the quantum mechanical principle of complementarity put forth by Niels Bohr and his school of physicists. Bohr claimed there are properties of particles that cannot simultaneously be measured. The new result backs up the Copenhagen school yet again, with the potential to shed light on other, less settled questions in quantum mechanics.

    <summary>Single-cell RNA splicing analysis reveals coordinated, conserved aging-associated splicing programs in mouse and human tissues, implicating Snrnp70 and an age-dependent SRSF5 splice-site shift as markers of a conserved &#39;youth&#39; program.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Alternative splicing is a key gene regulatory process that diversifies the proteome and controls gene dosage. Previous studies have detected aging-associated splicing changes across various tissues. However, their use of bulk RNA-seq obfuscates the impacted cell-types and may confound cell-type proportion changes with cell-intrinsic ones. We present a framework that first assembles and maps alternative splicing events in appropriate single cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq), then applies LeafletFA, a probabilistic model that discovers coordinated splicing programs (SPs) without requiring prior knowledge of cell types or clinical information, such as age. Applying this framework to over 200,000 cells from mouse and human Smart-seq2 multi-tissue atlases, we discovered global and cell type specific aging-associated SPs. In mice, integrating SPs with gene expression significantly improved age prediction in 46 of 76 tissue-cell types tested. We identified the RNA-binding protein textit{Snrnp70} as a key upstream mediator driving the shift from youthful to aged SPs. To test evolutionary conservation of these patterns, we employed transfer learning to map the murine splicing dictionary onto human transcriptomes. This revealed a conserved &amp;quot;youth&amp;quot; program (SP4) that is maintained in quiescent endothelial tissues but lost in high-turnover organs. We identified a conserved, age-dependent alternative 5&amp;#x27; splice site usage in the splicing factor textit{SRSF5} as a molecular marker of this program in both species. Our work establishes alternative splicing as a coordinated, evolutionarily conserved dimension of cellular aging and provides LeafletFA as an open-source tool for single-cell splicing analysis.

    <summary>A narrative cultural-history essay about the Soviet-era reinvention of New Year’s as a secular Christmas analogue and how that tradition is changing across the post-Soviet diaspora.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Every year in late December, my childhood home transformed into a vision of American bliss. We’d gather to ornament a tree, drape string lights around the house, and sit down to an elaborate feast. Not long after dawn the next day, while our little sister still slept, my brother and I would impatiently sneak downstairs to see our gifts, which we understood to have been delivered by a kindly old man. It could have been a scene out of A Christmas Story . Except we weren’t celebrating Christmas. My family was celebrating the Soviet version of New Year’s, a holiday that resembles Christmas in nearly every way, except that it takes place almost a week later and excludes Jesus, God, or any other signifier of religion. We were keeping the national tradition alive in suburban America, years after the country that invented it had dissolved. Soviet New Year’s began as a ritual in a country where all the religious rituals were gone. Long before the 1917 revolution that brought them to power, the leaders of the Soviet Union had decried religion as, in Karl Marx’s phrase, the opium of the masses. Their officially atheist government suppressed many kinds of spiritual observance, including Christmas. But by the mid-1930s, Soviet leaders sensed that people needed something to take the edge off in the dead of winter, a carnivalesque custom of the sort that Christmas once provided. So they took the most fun parts of the Christian holiday and plopped them on New Year’s. It became arguably the most important holiday on the country’s calendar. Other celebrations tended to come with historical significance, such as the anniversary of the revolution and of the Soviets’ victory in World War II. But New Year’s, at its core, was about nothing more and nothing less than family: a chance to come together and take stock. That may be a big reason it survived the Union’s dissolution. Even after religious institutions were allowed to conduct their services without government interference and their holidays were acknowledged, New Year’s remained important for both the people who had left the region and those who still lived there. But today, Soviet New Year’s customs are in danger of slipping away or evolving beyond recognition. Some people still celebrate the holiday the old way, with their families and gifts. Many, though, are establishing new practices that reflect new values and new political circumstances: Wars between former Soviet republics, for instance, and the ways that political leaders have used the momentous nature of the night for their own gains, have changed how people celebrate. A holiday that once felt embedded in the identity and culture of the Soviet people may soon become untethered from its history. Soviet New Year’s began at a time when morale in the country was, in general, low. It was the 1930s, and Ukraine had suffered one of the worst man-made famines in world history. The idea to bring joy to the winter came from a Communist Party leader named Pavel Postyshev, who had been one of the famine’s administrators. During an intimate car ride around Moscow with General Secretary Joseph Stalin and a future successor, Nikita Khrushchev, Postyshev proposed reviving the tradition of trees, but tied to a secular holiday. Stalin enthusiastically endorsed the idea, and in 1935, a letter from Postyshev appeared in Pravda , the official newspaper of the party’s central committee, arguing that all Soviet children should get to experience the cheer that the bourgeoisie’s children once had: “Let’s organize a fun New Year’s Eve party for the kids.” Postyshev’s idea spread like a wildfire in reverse—trees sprang up across the Soviet Union. The first year, delegates from the local party leadership and schoolteachers gathered parents and instructed them in how to decorate a tree. In some schools, Grandfather Frost, a Santa Claus equivalent, distributed gifts to kids. Soon, families adopted the new practice as their own. But Postyshev never got to see the extent of it. In the ’30s, Stalin consolidated power, punishing anyone he suspected of opposing him, including Postyshev—who was executed in 1939. The holiday soon became another tool for Stalin to reinforce his power and centrality in Soviet life. “The cheerful, happy children sang, danced, recited poems, praising in the songs and poems of their beloved Stalin, who gave them a joyful and happy life,” one 1938 newspaper report read. [ Read: Understanding Stalin ] After Stalin died, in 1953, the holiday’s focus turned away from politics. In 1956, Khrushchev delivered a speech criticizing Stalin’s “cult of personality” and his purges, signaling to people that they could drop the anxieties about political correctness that had constricted their lives in the Stalin era. The film Carnival Night , released that same year, captured the iconoclastic mood. In it, workers resist the efforts of their company director to organize a New Year’s celebration in which everything is acceptable to the people above him and no fun for those below. He plans to deliver a speech, but a worker persuades a magician to make the text disappear; when the director later goes to grab it, he instead finds a string of scarves and other knickknacks. The company director, representing a self-aggrandizing political blowhard, is humiliatingly sidelined, and the workers have a grand time. By the time my dad started celebrating New Year’s in Moscow, in the ’60s, most of the elements of the holiday I would come to know as a kid were present: family dinner, gifts, and a decorated tree. It had become an unquestioned fulcrum of Soviet life. If there was a custom of reading poems or singing songs in Khrushchev’s honor, it wasn’t ubiquitous. Once the country’s leaders began giving an annual New Year’s address, in 1970, these speeches weren’t taken seriously. They were filled with empty platitudes, “void of meaning,” according to The Invention of Russia , by the journalist Arkady Ostrovsky . “These addresses were merely a prompt for popping the corks from bottles.” That cork-popping continued even as the Soviet Union dissolved and many people left the region. I was born in Moscow in 1996, five years after the fall of the Union, and we moved to upstate New York five years after that. For a long time, the New Year’s my family celebrated was stuck in amber, the old tree-and-gifts version. In the former Soviet republics, people still considered the day significant but changed some of the customs. In Armenia, for instance, once religious holidays were again allowed, religious institutions attached themselves to New Year’s. From the early 1990s until 2023, the head of the national Church would deliver a midnight address right before the country’s president or prime minister. Tigran Simyan, a professor at Yerevan State University who studies the evolution of New Year’s in Armenia and the post-Soviet world, told me, “Our happy New Year, for us, is more important than Christmas.” [ Read: When the Soviets voted ] Politics also returned to the holiday after the Soviet Union’s fall. In Russia, the seeming end of single-party rule and a brief moment of political competition revived the status of the New Year’s address. It was a rare time when all eyes were focused on the same speaker. The Russian Federation’s first president, Boris Yeltsin, strategically resigned on December 31, 1999, giving his handpicked successor, Vladimir Putin, the opportunity to introduce himself during a midnight address as the millennium turned. “The ritual was unmistakably staged,” Ostrovsky writes in The Invention of Russia . “The New Year’s address had greater symbolic value than any election.” In more recent times, young Russians have tended to focus on partying on New Year’s Eve. But the many people who maintain the Soviet way of celebrating at home with family might still put on Putin’s address. Once again, a popular film captures the mood. The plot of 2010’s Yolki is almost the exact opposite of Carnival Night ’s. Whereas the 1956 film is about a collaborative effort to prevent a speech, Yolki features people across the country working together to help a girl on her quixotic quest to insert a phrase into the president’s midnight address, granting the address central importance. Yolki was the first in what became Russia’s most financially successful non-animated film franchise, despite the series’ declining artistic and entertainment value. Its 12th sequel, set as ever on New Year’s Eve, came out this December. Eventually, politics’ creep back into the New Year’s holiday began to affect the way my family celebrated in the United States. Although for years, none of us took what Putin said in his address too seriously, my grandparents still put it on out of habit. But as his regime grew more repressive and violent, we let that go. The way I remember it, we stopped after Russia’s initial invasion of Ukraine, in 2014, deciding that we didn’t need to support Putin’s rule on our holiday. But my dad dates our move away from the midnight address to earlier, in 2012. That year, Putin stepped through a loophole in constitutional term limits and returned to the presidency , then brutally suppressed the protests that followed. “I didn’t want to hear him anymore,” my dad told me recently. After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine , in February 2022, some Ukrainians’ New Year’s celebrations stopped. “What is there to celebrate when there is a war?” a Ukrainian soldier serving on the front line asked Euronews last New Year’s. Meanwhile, I spent last New Year’s in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, where clubs had just been closed for weeks in deference to protests over the government pausing its European Union accession bid. Though some young people I talked with were spending the night with their family, many spilled out onto Rustaveli Avenue in the city center for a combination party, protest, and celebration. Without a single state to hold it together, and so many interstate conflicts, the Soviet New Year’s tradition is splintering across the Soviet diaspora. [ Read: What I learned from the Georgia protests ] Perhaps soon the holiday will become unrecognizable from its former iteration, especially as the people who remember its origins adapt to new cultures or pass away. My own family no longer makes a point of gathering on the holiday. In part, that’s because my siblings and I have gotten older, scattered, and given in to assimilationist pressure—the fear of missing out on the American custom of partying with our friends on New Year’s. But we’ve also lost the center of gravity that held us to the Soviet tradition. Early in November, my last surviving grandmother suffered a stroke, which paralyzed most of her body, leaving only her eyes and one arm fully mobile. Her grandfather, my great-great-grandfather, became a Bolshevik in 1905 and participated in the three revolutions that led to the establishment of the Soviet Union. His son, her father, wrote and disseminated anti-religious propaganda. Much of my family’s adherence to the holiday might very well be because of this history. On Thanksgiving, days before my grandmother died, I told her I was researching our holiday tradition. She squeezed my hand and blinked knowingly. Watching the tradition slip away feels like losing part of the Soviet and post-Soviet identity that’s defined my family for more than a century. I feel a grief that’s hard to disentangle from my grief for the people who passed the tradition on to me. But looking back on how my family has acted in decisive moments, I’m also aware of an opportunity. My forefathers helped form the Soviet identity and its rituals, even before there was a country to promote them. Likewise, during and after the Soviet Union’s existence, although politicians repeatedly imposed a tone that fit their priorities, my family chose how to spend the day. Ultimately, the common people reshaped the holiday to suit their needs and values. Their examples prove that people can make their own traditions, with whatever ideals they inherit. ​​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

    <summary>Bioinformatics, simulations, and fluorescence spectroscopy suggest class II fungal peroxidases evolved reduced tryptophan-to-heme FRET to favor long-range electron transfer from lignin substrates, improving lignin degradation efficiency.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    A key step in the evolution of lignin-degrading enzymes is revealed by the observation that, unlike other heme-proteins studied to date, Class II peroxidases exhibit minimal energy transfer from tryptophan (Trp) to heme residues. Bioinformatics analyses and molecular dynamics simulations of Class II (MnP and VP) and Class III (horseradish peroxidase, HrP) structures indicate that the Trp residue in HrP has the highest orientational factor and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency. By contrast, Trp residues in MnP and VP display low FRET efficiency due to unfavorable orientation factors despite their proximity to the heme. Steady-state fluorescence experiments confirmed this low FRET efficiency, showing strong emission in MnP and VP but weak emission in HrP. This decreased Trp-to-heme energy transfer appears to minimize competition between direct FRET and long-range electron transfer (LRET), allowing electrons to flow from bulky lignin substrates to the heme center. Such a mechanism likely provided a selective advantage during the evolution of Class II peroxidases, facilitating efficient lignin degradation at the enzyme surface.

    <summary>Reports a one-step synthesis of trehalose-capped atomically precise Au25 nanoclusters with noted chirality and enhanced thiourea-triggered antimicrobial activity in water, offering limited indirect relevance to origins-of-life topics beyond aqueous stability and chirality.</summary>

    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    The ability to synthesize well-defined atomically precise nanoclusters is important both in advancing fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships of nanomaterials and for materials, energy, and biomedical applications. Nonetheless, incorporating bioactive ligands into the nanoclusters poses a significant challenge, possibly due to complex metallophilic interactions and incompatibility with typical synthetic conditions. In this work, we developed a straightforward method for the synthesis of an atomically precise gold nanocluster capped with a carbohydrate ligand, trehalose, Au25Tre18, in one step and in 55% yield. The formation of the nanocluster was enabled by using a mild reducing agent, t-butylamine borane, in a biphasic condition. The structure was confirmed by high-resolution mass spectrometry, optical absorption spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). 2D DOSY NMR gave a diffusion coefficient of 1.93 × 10-10 m2s-1 and the hydrodynamic diameter of 1.88 nm for Au25Tre18. The CD spectrum of Au25SG18 indicated chirality, having features differing from other chiral Au25 nanoclusters. The aqueous solution of is stable at elevated temperatures, e.g., 80 oC. In a thiourea (TU)-triggered release assay, Au25Tre18 exhibited enhanced antimicrobial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis, showing a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) four times lower than that of its analogous nanocluster capped with glutathione, Au25SG18. Treating the bacteria at 1×MIC of Au25Tre18/TU resulted in complete eradication of bacteria, whereas bacteria treated with Au25SG18/TU at the same concentration continued to grow.

    <summary>Using spectroscopic probes and ML-aided simulations, this study shows that constrained hydrogen-bond network growth in water/HFIP strengthens H-bonding and measurably tunes acidity, offering broadly relevant physico-chemical insight for how microenvironments could modulate prebiotic reaction conditions.</summary>

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    The reactivity of hydrogen bond networks (HBNs) is critical to many chemical and biological scenarios. When the HBNs are under constraint, hydrogen bond strength and acidity are affected significantly. HBNs exhibit cooperativity, where connections formed in one part of the HBN influence its behavior elsewhere. We combined experimental and computational approaches to examine the growth of the HBNs of water and hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), constrained by an aprotic cosolvent. We independently employed vibrational frequency shift of an acetonitrile probe, 1H NMR chemical shift of an aniline probe, and molecular dynamics with machine learning interatomic potentials, to demonstrate the increase in the hydrogen bond strength with the growth of the HBNs. Finally, using vibrational spectroscopy of a titratable probe, we established that not only the hydrogen bond strength, but also the acidity of HFIP is affected by the changes in the network geometry. These results enable the engineering and measurement of HBNs in confined environments with tailored acidity.

    Large-scale single-cell CRISPR screens with single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) readouts provide critical data to map causal gene regulatory networks (GRNs). However, translating the complex scRNA-seq outputs into reliable causal insights remains a major analytical challenge. Here we present CausalGRN, a scalable computational framework that infers causal GRNs and predicts cellular responses to unseen perturbations. CausalGRN first mitigates pervasive spurious partial correlations in sparse scRNA-seq data through a novel adaptive thresholding correction, enabling robust inference of an undirected graph. It then orients this graph using observed perturbation outcomes. The resulting directed GRN can be used to predict the downstream effects of novel perturbations via network propagation. Across both simulations and diverse experimental datasets, CausalGRN substantially outperforms existing approaches in network reconstruction accuracy and in predicting the effects of unseen perturbations, providing a principled bridge from perturbation data to causal gene regulation.

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    We describe a collaborative research project spanning the disciplines of quantum hardware, quantum algorithms, conventional computational chemistry, synthetic medicinal chemistry and life sciences. Our project seeks to demonstrate an impact of quantum computing on human health. It is one of several funded by Wellcome Leap as part of their Quantum for Bio Program. We aim to use quantum computing to guide the discovery of covalent inhibitors for the treatment of the rare disease myotonic dystrophy type I. Modelling the formation of a chemical bond in the context of the rest of the inhibitor and the protein is a challenge, because of the size of the systems of interest, the intricacies of the electronic structure where the importance of electron correlation may vary between reactant and transition states, and the extensive sampling of configurational space that is often required. We are developing an efficient hybrid quantum-classical framework to address the accuracy and scalability limitations of conventional computational drug design approaches. A quantum-enhanced density functional approximation is developed based on data from computation on neutral-atom quantum hardware, which can then be deployed within conventional quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations. Our quantum-enhanced framework can be systematically updated as more capable quantum processors become available, heralding the prospect of using quantum-derived data to train improved density functional approximations and, ultimately, to support a wide range of drug design efforts.

    <summary>Engineered 3D DNA crystals coated with amorphous calcium carbonate show enhanced nuclease resistance and tunable mesoporosity for stimuli-responsive small-molecule release, offering broad (though not explicitly prebiotic) insight into nucleic acid self-assembly and mineral–biopolymer interactions.</summary>

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Self-assembling 3D DNA crystals, composed of a repeating lattice of 3D DNA tiles, have emerged as a powerful technique in the field of materials synthesis. Porous DNA crystals have been used for diffraction studies, electronics, and drug loading, but stability in complex biological media, and the development of responsive cargo deposition has yet to be realized. In this paper, we engineer DNA crystals using the tensegrity triangles that exhibit tunable mesoporous properties, nuclease resistance, stimuli-responsive small molecule release through coating the inner lattice with amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC). We demonstrate a general method for varying degrees of calcification, and we characterize the morphology the ensuing ACC material through polarized optical microscopy and Raman microscopy. These calcified crystals are further characterized by producing molecular structures of the underlying DNA lattice via X-ray diffraction and Ca phasing. We show the resistance of calcified crystals to degradation by serum nuclease. By studying the deintercalation and intercalation of ethidium bromide as a drug analog, we confirm that calcium carbonate addition allows for tunable pore-size to enable selective drug-release. We anticipate this work will serve as a foundation for studies on the targeted binding and release of small molecules to enable smart medical nanomaterials and drug delivery systems.

    <title>🔴 ChemRxiv ➤ Hartree-Fock density functional theory works through error cancellation for the interaction energies of halogen and chalcogen bonded complexes</title>

    <summary>Computational chemistry study showing HF-DFT accuracy for halogen/chalcogen-bond interaction energies largely arises from functional–density error cancellation, offering methodological insights (with minor relevance to modeling water and other weak interactions) but no direct origins-of-life focus.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Unusually large energy errors of semi-local density functional approximations (DFAs) for molecules are often strongly reduced by using the Hartree–Fock (HF) electron density instead of the self-consistent DFA density. For reaction barriers and water clusters, some of us earlier found that HF-DFT succeeds not because the HF density is accurate, but due to cancellation of negative functional-driven error (FE) by positive density-driven error (DE). Since DE, as defined here, is biased toward the self-consistent DFA density and against the HF density, the DE of the HF density is referred to as non-variational density over-localization (NVDO). In this work, we show that interaction energy errors in halogen- and chalcogen-bonded complexes in the B30 data set are not dominated by density-driven error. Instead, HF-DFT again succeeds through FE–DE cancellation. Benchmark Kohn–Sham inversions of coupled-cluster densities for NH3…ClF, Cl-…ClF, Cl-…SF2, Cl-...SCF2, and Cl-…PF3 provide strong evidence for this cancellation. For additional complexes, we employ the long-range-corrected hybrid LCωPBE as a proxy for electron-transfer errors in the exact density. We also examine several self-interaction correction (SIC) methods and find significant improvement from FLOSIC. We point out common features of the density errors in the NH3…ClF, Cl-…ClF complexes and three transition states, arguing that significant density-driven errors of energy arise only from electron-transfer errors. We also highlight a common feature in our present and previous work: long bonds can lead to non-negligible functional-driven self-interaction error of the energy from otherwise-accurate semi-local functionals in transition states, water clusters, and halogen or chalcogen bonds.

    <summary>Introduces sub-ångström liquid-phase 3D electron diffraction to solve in situ crystal structures and phase transformations (e.g., glycine and an aluminum–glycine hydrate) directly in aqueous liquids, a broadly enabling method for studying prebiotic-relevant crystallization and molecular organization.</summary>

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Atomic-scale insights into phase transitions and structural dynamics of crystals in liquids are fundamental for understanding chemical, physical, and biological processes. Liquid-phase transmission electron microscopy (LP-TEM) platform integrates diffraction, imaging, and spectroscopy and has opened new opportunities to study nanoscale materials in liquid environments. Yet, atomic-scale electron crystallographic analysis of crystals in liquids remains elusive. Here, we establish sub-ångström liquid-phase three-dimensional electron diffraction (LP-3D ED) for capturing phase transformation and determining atomic crystal structures in situ by exploiting nanochannel liquid cells. The well-defined and ultrathin liquid layers confined within the nanochannels enable the acquisition of 3D ED data at 0.80 Å resolution from organic molecular crystals in liquids at room temperature. Using LP-3D ED combined with liquid flow control, we observe the β-to-α phase transformation of glycine and in situ crystallization of a novel hydrated aluminum-glycine phase in aqueous solution in the nanochannels. We demonstrate ab initio crystal structure determination at sub-ångström resolution by LP-3D ED, and identify a novel hexanuclear aluminum-hydroxide-glycine cluster in the in situ formed aluminum-glycine phase. This work demonstrates the capability of LP-3D ED to probe structural evolution and to reveal solvated crystal structures of nano- and microcrystals directly in liquid environments.

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Considering the harsh surface conditions on Mars, terrestrial organisms that can survive and remain detectable after exposure to similar conditions provide invaluable models for guiding current and future search-for-life missions. To this end, we evaluated the extremophilic archaeon Acidianus manzaensis grown on ESA01-E Mars analog material as a model organism. We exposed cell-mineral mixtures to one month of desiccation and two weeks of Mars-like conditions in a Mars simulation chamber to evaluate the potential for cell survival after exposure to these conditions. In the search for reliable biomarkers in other planetary environments, such as Mars, molecules that are stable over geological timescales while preserving information indicative of their potential biological origin are crucial. Thiophene-bearing quinones fulfill these requirements, and thiophenes, which are their basic moieties, have been discovered on Mars. Therefore, we analyzed the thiophene-bearing quinone composition of A. manzaensis using mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and discussed potential molecular alterations. Successful re-cultivation after one month of desiccation and two weeks of exposure to Mars-like conditions proved the durability of the organism and its capability for cell recovery after exposure to extreme conditions, paving the way for further investigation.

Is This the Worst-Ever Era of American Pop Culture? By Spencer Kornhaber An emerging critical consensus argues that we’ve entered a cultural dark age. I’m not so sure. My Shipwreck Story By Alec Frydman On my first time out as a commercial fisherman, my boat sank, my captain died, and I was left adrift and alone in the Pacific. An Innocent Abroad in Mark Twain’s Paris By Caity Weaver My quest for a true literary experience resulted in choucroute , a surprise organ feast, an epiphany at the Louvre, existential dread, and a rowboat.

When Adoption Promises Are Broken By Nicole Chung Many birth mothers hope to maintain contact with their child. But their agreements with adoptive parents can be fragile. Evening Read Jan Buchczik New Year’s Resolutions That Will Actually Lead to Happiness By Arthur C. Brooks If you are someone who follows a traditional religion, you most likely have a day such as Yom Kippur, Ashura, or Ash Wednesday, dedicated to atoning for your sins and vowing to make improvements to your life. But if you are not religious, you might still practice a day of devotion and ritualistic vows of self-improvement each year on January 1. New Year’s Day rings in the month of January, dedicated by the ancient Romans to their god Janus. Religious Romans promised the two-faced god that they would be better in the new year than they had been in the past. According to the Pew Research Center , historically between one-third and one-half of Americans observe this pagan rite every year by making their own New Year’s resolutions. The most common resolutions are fairly predictable : financial resolutions, like saving more money or paying down debt (51 percent in 2019); eating healthier (51 percent); exercising more (50 percent); and losing weight (42 percent). Old Janus is pretty annoyed at this point, I imagine, because our resolutions overwhelmingly fail. Read the full article. Culture Break (Illustration by Shawna X) Watch.

    <title>🟡 biophysics ➤ Structural basis for hydrolytic splicing of a circularly permuted group II intron</title>

    <summary>Cryo-EM structures of a circularly permuted group II intron reveal how active-site rearrangements switch self-splicing from branching to water-driven hydrolysis, informing the evolution and mechanistic flexibility of ancient RNA catalysis relevant to origins-of-life models.</summary>

    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Group II introns are self-splicing ribozymes that are considered the ancestors of the eukaryotic spliceosome. Unlike canonical group II introns that self-splice to generate linear exons and lariats, circularly permuted (CP) group II introns identified in various bacterial phyla perform back-splicing, resulting in the production of circular RNAs and branched products via branching pathway. Furthermore, CP introns may switch to a hydrolysis pathway resulting in distinct products to differentially regulate gene expression. In this study, we present biochemical data and high-resolution cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of a CP group II intron from Comamonas testosteroni KF-1 (Cte 1), allowing mechanistic dissection of the branching pathway switch to the hydrolysis pathway and enabling reconstruction of both both steps of the hydrolysis pathway. The structures reveal that CP undergoes the hydrolysis pathway upon mutations of the branch point or splice sites (SS) due to rearrangements in the active site. Here, the branching nucleotide in domain D6 is retracted from its catalytically competent conformation, giving way to the nucleophilic water molecule to attack the 5&amp;#x27; splice site. Furthermore, we visualized the intermediates of the second splicing step, which reveal the movement of domain D6 out of the way for the 3&amp;#x27;-splicing to occur, closely resembling the second-step structures of the branching pathway. Finally, our structures provide direct evidence for domains D1D2D3 acting as a scaffold in group II introns.Together, these findings visualize the complete hydrolysis pathway and offer a new strategy to engineer CP introns for circular RNA production, with potential applications in both basic research and therapeutic development.

    <title>🟠 eLife ➤ Evolution of a fuzzy ribonucleoprotein complex in viral assembly</title>

    <summary>This study shows that SARS‑CoV‑2 nucleocapsid variants convergently tune multiple weak protein–RNA and protein–protein interactions to form polydisperse “fuzzy” RNP clusters, highlighting how reversible RNA–protein self-organization can evolve despite lacking a single rigid structure.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Previously, we showed that the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein explores a wide range of biophysical properties facilitated by non-local impact of point mutations to its intrinsically disordered regions (Nguyen et al., 2024). This includes modulation of self-association, such as the creation of a de novo binding interface through the P13L mutation characteristic of Omicron variants. In the present work, we focus on the key function of N condensing viral RNA into ribonucleoprotein particles (RNPs) for viral assembly. Lacking high-resolution structural information, biochemical and biophysical approaches have revealed architectural principles of RNPs, which involve cooperative interactions of several protein-protein and protein-RNA interfaces, initiated through oligomerization of conserved transient helices in the central disordered linker of N. Here, we study the impact of defining N-protein mutations in variants of concern on RNP formation, using biophysical tools, a virus-like particle assay, and reverse genetics experiments. We find convergent evolution in repeated, independent introduction of amino acid substitutions strengthening existing binding interfaces, compensating for other substitutions that promote viral replication but decrease RNP stability. Furthermore, we show that the P13L mutation of Omicron variants enhances RNP assembly and increases viral fitness. Overall, our data reveal RNP complexes to be highly variable not only in sequence and conformations but also in thermodynamic and kinetic stability, with its pleomorphism affecting basic architectural principles. We hypothesize that the formation of polydisperse, fuzzy N-RNA clusters with multiple distributed weak binding interfaces optimizes reversible RNA condensation, while supporting host adaptation and allowing for a large sequence space to be explored.

    A spectacular fossil trove on the Arctic island of Spitsbergen shows that marine life made a stunning comeback after Earth’s greatest extinction. Tens of thousands of fossils reveal fully aquatic reptiles and complex food chains thriving just three million years later. Some predators grew over five meters long, challenging the idea of a slow, step-by-step recovery. The find rewrites the early history of ocean ecosystems.

    <summary>A population-genetics study of local adaptation and origin/sex-dependent dispersal fitness in wild Atlantic salmon, with no direct relevance to origins-of-life or astrobiology.</summary>
    <content type="html">
    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Local adaptation is often portrayed as uniform fitness disadvantages of immigrants relative to residents. Yet dispersal costs vary with origin, sex, and life-history traits, shaping the balance between gene flow and adaptation. We quantified these heterogeneous costs by comparing the reproductive success of local and immigrant individuals using a 15-year genetic pedigree of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), including over 1,100 adults and 3,400 juveniles. Immigrants represented 19.5% of adults, showed male-biased dispersal, and averaged 15% lower reproductive success than locals. However, outcomes were strongly origin-dependent: immigrants from some populations suffered severe fitness costs while others matched or exceeded locals. Sex and life-history further modulated reproductive success: male immigrants underperformed local males, whereas multi-sea-winter females often equaled or outperformed female residents. Immigrant males partially compensated their fitness offset by acquiring more mates. These findings highlight that, while local adaptation promotes philopatry, immigrants origin effects should be considered in gene-flow adaptation dynamics.

    Entropy, Vol. 28, Pages 47: Optimizing ATP Isothermal Tests: A Theoretical and Experimental Approach Entropy doi: 10.3390/e28010047 Authors: Juan P. Martínez-Val Piera Alberto Ramos Millán The International Agreement on the Carriage of Perishable Foodstuffs and on the Special Equipment to Be Used for Such Carriage (usually known as ATP Treaty) defines a standardized isothermal test for qualifying refrigerated containers, but its current protocol is lengthy, costly and lacks scientific justification. This paper presents a combined theoretical and experimental study aimed at optimizing this procedure. First, a heat-transfer framework based on transient conduction and thermal diffusivity is developed to estimate stabilization times using dimensionless criteria. Then, extensive experimental tests on ATP containers validate these predictions and reveal additional phenomena such as air leakage and chimney effects. Based on these findings, a revised protocol is proposed that reduces the test duration from more than 18 h to approximately 2 h while preserving the thermal stabilization conditions required by ATP. Experimental results show that the uncertainty in the determination of the global heat-transfer coefficient K is reduced from about 2&amp;amp;ndash;2.3% in the classical ATP procedure to roughly 0.7&amp;amp;ndash;1.0% with the new protocol. In addition, the method suppresses secondary physical effects&amp;amp;mdash;such as chimney-driven air leakage and latent-heat losses due to water evaporation&amp;amp;mdash;thus improving the physical representativeness of the measured K value. The proposed accelerated protocol offers a scientifically grounded, cost-effective alternative for future ATP standards.

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) serves as a non-invasive biomarker for cancer detection, but conventional methods face challenges due to the ultra-low abundance of tumor-derived cfDNA (ctDNA) among normal cfDNA. Though nucleosome-bound cfDNA harbors rich epigenomic features that could enable ctDNA identification by single-molecule multi-omics cross-validation, this remains unexplored due to methodological limits. Here, we developed a cfDNA sequencing approach integrating methylation, fragmentomics, and histone modifications at the single-molecule level; together with gene semantics and epigenomic annotations, these modalities were vectorized and fused to represent each cfDNA molecule. We trained a Transformer-based model (cfAI) to profile and evaluate ctDNA likelihood at molecule, gene, and sample levels. cfAI achieved ~10-fold enrichment of cancer-derived signals over noise and reached 72.6% sensitivity at 93.1% specificity for multi-cancer detection. Our study establishes an innovative framework that overcomes the inherent signal-to-noise limitations of conventional assays and reveals biological features at molecular resolution for cancer detection.

    <summary>A large-scale comparative genomics study mapping Z-DNA/Z-RNA-forming sequences across 281k genomes, finding pervasive enrichment in cellular life but strong lineage-specific depletion in influenza viruses consistent with evolutionary pressure from host sensing pathways.</summary>

    &lt;hr/&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Z-DNA/Z-RNA is an alternative left-handed nucleic acid conformation with established and emerging roles in gene regulation, immunity, and genome instability. However, its occurrence dynamics and lineage specificity across the tree of life have not yet been fully characterized. Utilizing the recently developed and improved Z-DNA searching tool, ZSeeker, we analyzed 281,139 complete organismal genomes, including multiple Telomere-to-Telomere genome assemblies, and generated genome-wide Z-nucleic acid maps, examined their topography, and compared them to dinucleotide-preserving controls. Cellular genomes featured pervasive Z-DNA enrichment relative to expectation, with enrichments of ~1.5 and ~1.7-fold in Bacteria and Archaea and ~3-fold in Eukaryota. In contrast, Viruses exhibited large differences between lineages, with modest enrichment in several DNA viral groups and pronounced depletion across RNA clades, most notably Influenza A/B strains. We built a LASSO regression model trained on non-Influenza viruses (cross-validated R2 {approx} 0.73), which identified GC content, genome type, and host type as the leading predictors for Z-nucleic acid density, yet it significantly over-predicted Z-RNA density in Influenza A/B. More than 99% of assemblies exceeded the +2 SD threshold, and a &amp;quot;typical Influenza&amp;quot; genome was predicted at 2.76 bp/kb compared to ~0.016 bp/kb observed (a ~170-fold overestimation based on chance alone). Together, these results reveal domain- and lineage-specific regimes: cellular genomes are enriched for Z-DNA consistent with regulatory roles, whereas influenza viruses appear to have undergone strong, lineage-specific depletion of Z-RNA-forming sequences, likely reflecting evolutionary pressure tied to host sensing pathways.

    Comparative analysis of redox properties across three chemically distinct datasets—interstellar compounds, human nutritional molecules, and &amp;gt;40 million substances in the PubChem database—reveals a striking and highly non-random pattern. Interstellar molecules and human nutrients exhibit nearly identical proportions of prooxidant, proreductant, and amphoteric species.

    Extensive fungal growth has been detected on the walls and other building constructions in the inner parts of the Shelter of the damaged fourth Unit of the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in 1997-98. The mycobiota comprised 37 species of 19 genera. Zygomycetes and ascomycetes were represented by one species each: Mucor plumbeus and Chaetomium globosum, […] The post Fungi From Chernobyl: Mycobiota Of The Inner Regions Of The Containment Structures Of The Damaged Nuclear Reactor appeared first on Astrobiology .

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    NASA’s Curiosity captured this close-up image of a rock nicknamed “Snow Lake” on June 8, 2024, the 4,209th Martian day, or sol, of the mission. Nine days earlier, the rover had crushed a similar-looking rock and revealed crystalline textures — and elemental sulfur — inside.

    &lt;strong&gt;Abstract:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
    Comet Interceptor is an ESA science mission with payload contributions from ESA Member States and with an international participation by JAXA. It is the first mission that is being designed, built, and potentially launched before its target is known. This approach will enable the spacecraft to perform the first mission to a Long Period Comet […] The post Considerations On The Process Of Target Selection For The Comet Interceptor Mission appeared first on Astrobiology .
